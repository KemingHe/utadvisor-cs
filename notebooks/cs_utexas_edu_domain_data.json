It can feel scary to adapt to the college workload and environment at first, but getting to know peers who are all in the same boat makes everything so much better. It\u2019s also nice to look back after finishing a particularly challenging project or finally finishing something early and seeing how much you\u2019ve learned and that you\u2019re capable of more than you first expected :) What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Don't be afraid to ask for help! Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it, there are so many people feeling just as lost as you are, and you'll be surprised at how many amazing people are more than happy to help you Best place to eat in Austin?

    "text_content": "Kristen Grauman Named Finalist in 2021 Blavatnik National Awards for Young Scientists | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Kristen Grauman Named Finalist in 2021 Blavatnik National Awards for Young Scientists Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, July 6, 2021 University of Texas at Austin computer science researcher Kristen Grauman was selected as a finalist for the 2021 Blavatnik National Awards for Young Scientists . Professor Grauman, who leads the UT Austin Computer Vision Group , focuses on visual recognition, image and video search, video analysis, first-person vision, embodied and multi-modal perception, and interactive machine learning. She was also named a finalist in 2020 . \"The Blavatnik Awards jury was impressed by her visionary approach to big data and to the role of human interactions in computer vision, and the profound impact her work has had on the field,\" said Brooke Grindlinger, Chief Scientific Officer for Scientific Programs & Awards at the New York Academy of Sciences. \"Her numerous contributions to the most challenging and contemporary problems in object recognition define her as one of the most influential researchers in computer vision today.\" Today, the capacity of computer technology to obtain and store images and video has outpaced the human capacity to analyze it effectively. Grauman\u00a0aims to solve this problem by focusing her research on visual recognition and active perception. Her\u00a0research has made large-scale crowdsourcing an indispensable tool for tasks in visual recognition, improved search times by orders of magnitude when searching millions of images, and pushed the frontiers of knowledge linking modern computer vision with robotics,\u00a0the Blavatnik Family Foundation has noted. Her work includes research on visual systems that interpret scenes using inferences, an approach more efficient and human-like compared to handling vast sums of visual data all at once. \"Each day, young scientists tirelessly seek solutions to humanity's greatest challenges,\" said Len Blavatnik , founder and chairman of Access Industries, and head of the Blavatnik Family Foundation. \"The Blavatnik Awards recognize this scientific brilliance and tenacity as we honor these 31 finalists. We congratulate them on their accomplishments and look forward to their continued, future discoveries and success.\" Grauman has received other recognition as a\u00a0Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, an\u00a0Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow and a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. A Blavatnik Laureate will be selected from among the finalists in Grauman's category later this year. Cross-posted from College of Natural Sciences",

    "text_content": "Turing Scholars Honors Program Student Life | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Turing Scholars Student Life The Turing Scholars program supports a strong social life. The small class size bolsters a tight-knit community within each class, and weekly social events help facilitate interactions between incoming Turing Scholars and older Turing Scholars. Turing Scholars Student Association The Turing Scholars Student Association (TSSA) is a student organization that regularly hosts free social events for Turing Scholars, including food! Examples of recent events include bowling, a catered Shaved Ice truck social, kickball, a nerf gun battle, super smash bros. tournaments, PowerPoint karaoke, a trick-or-treating research social with professors, and much more. The TSSA is able to hold these events thanks to generous partners, which support the organization in exchange for the ability to hold private recruiting events with Turing Scholars. At the end of each semester, the TSSA hosts a banquet celebrating our graduating seniors and the accomplishments of our Turing Scholars throughout the semester. Faculty are also invited, and trivia games ensue. Turing Intramural Sports Turing Scholars passionate about athletics often come together and form Turing-wide intramural (IM) sports teams every semester. Team practices are a great way to get to know other Turing Scholars while staying active. The most popular Turing teams are The Floppy Disks\u2014the Ultimate Frisbee team\u2014and Foo Barcelona\u2014the soccer team. Turing Scholars have also had IM teams for Basketball, Volleyball, Racquetball, Flag Football, and Dodgeball. The Turing Scholars Student Association covers all team registration fees at no cost to students.

Turing Scholars have also had IM teams for Basketball, Volleyball, Racquetball, Flag Football, and Dodgeball. The Turing Scholars Student Association covers all team registration fees at no cost to students. TSSA Office The Turing Scholars Student Association has an office on the third floor of the Gates Dell Complex. You'll always be able to find Turing Scholars working, socializing, and hanging out in the TSSA office from 12-5pm on weekdays. Honors Dorm Lobbies Many first year Turing students choose to study together in the lobbies of the dorms that make up the Honors Quad. Students explain complex ideas to each other, study for exams together, and support each other completing common assignments. Gates Dell Computer Science Complex In addition to the above spaces, the Gates Dell Complex, home of the department of computer science, provides ample space for Turing Scholars to socialize and work together. There are 2 computer labs (on the 1st and 3rd floor) where Computer Science students can work as well as numerous common areas and rooms to study in. Women in Turing Women compose approximately 25% of each Turing class per year. While this percentage is higher than the national average, director Dr. Calvin Lin says \"it\u2019s something we want to further improve upon,\" seeking to focus on high school outreach and dig deeper into the root causes of the imbalance. In the short term, women in the Turing Scholars Honors Program have a host of opportunities and ways to seek community. Women in Turing Scholars (WiTS) and Women's Coffee There is a strong sense of community among Women in Turing Scholars (WiTS). From group chats to study groups to boba tea runs, WiTS maintains an active and welcoming community and support system. TSSA also hosts an annual catered Women's Coffee, inviting female students and faculty to engage in a safe space. Women in Computer Science (WiCS) WiCS is a student organization within the UTCS department. Their mission is to encourage and support women in computing through outreach, professional development, academic initiatives, and social events. Many women in Turing regularly participate in WiCS events, engaging with women in CS both in and outside of the Turing program. Big/Little Program The Big/Littles Program is a program where incoming students are paired with an upperclass Turing Scholar. These pairs are made based on information collected from both the upperclass student and the first-year student- to make sure that students are paired with someone who can offer advice and provide information. Bigs help Littles adjust to the college environment and help them navigate the corporate, research, and social sides of computer science. Bigs make sure that new students have the information they need to thrive, and they provide access to any community resources that may be useful in this transitory period. We find that these relationships last well beyond this first year and help foster growth and interaction in the overall Turing community. While this program is not required, it is highly encouraged.

Meeting new people in general has been one of my favorite experiences in UTCS; I've met some of my closest friends through UTCS and am so glad that I had the opportunity to! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Coming into UTCS, I was worried that I didn't know enough or knew less than others.

    "text_content": "Entry-Level | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Academics Curriculum & Degree Plans Entry-Level Every CS student begins as entry-level until they complete the following requirements to be promoted into the upper division sequence. Promotion Requirements: CS entry-level students must complete all requirements in order to be promoted into the upper division sequence. (1) 2.0 UT GPA (2) Complete C S 312, C S 311 and C S 314 with no grades lower than a C- (3) Complete all CS entry-level courses in no more than 2 attempts (students may appeal to receive a third, and final attempt at an entry-level course if they have a verified non-academic Q-drop within the semester the course was taken) . *** Transfer courses taken prior to initial enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin may be reviewed, and if approved, can substitute for the entry-level courses. Upon enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin, all remaining entry-level courses must be taken in residence. *** Students' records will be reviewed following the posting of grades at the conclusion of each long semester and summer. Students who meet the requirements for promotion will be automatically promoted into the major. Please note: University policy states that you may NOT for any reason retake a course if you have made a C- or better. That is true of our entry-level courses as well. College of Natural Sciences/Computer Science Repetition of a Course Policy As stated in the Undergraduate Catalog, no more than two attempts are allowed for a given course offered by the College of Natural Sciences. A third, and final attempt may be granted if a student receives a non-academic Q drop (Q) or Withdrawal (W) from the College of Natural Sciences Dean\u2019s Office. This includes all computer science, science, and math/statistics courses. These rules apply to students who are completing entry-level requirements as well as those who have been promoted into their respective Computer Science degree. If a student cannot complete a course that is required for a degree in Computer Science because they are not allowed any further attempts, they will be required to change majors. Students must make at least a C- in all computer science, math and science courses that are required for their degree. It is strongly suggested that students contact the CNS Non-Academic Counselors immediately if they feel a non-academic situation has occurred in a given semester that has the possibility of disrupting their ability to complete the course successfully. Below are the guidelines set forth by the College of Natural Sciences to potentially qualify for a non-academic Q drop or Withdrawal. Their phone number is 512-471-4536 and their office is located in WCH 1.106 if students feel they need to schedule an appointment. Non-academic Q drop/s or Withdrawal up until the Mid-semester Deadline can be considered for non-academic reasons through the CNS Dean's Office. These non-academic reasons include documentable medical, mental health, or other life problems that students encounter, such as deaths, financial duress, legal conflicts, etc. The student would have to meet with a CNS Non-academic Counselor to discuss the situation, to see if it qualifies for the Non-academic Q Drop or Withdrawal. Official documentation is required for any Non-academic Q drop/s or Withdrawal. After the Drop Deadline, Non-academic Q drop/s or Withdrawal is only considered for non-academic reasons through the CNS Dean's Office if the following criteria is met: (1) the student had been passing with a C- or better up until the drop deadline, so there was no reason to drop, then (2) something urgent and critical occurred after this date, that can be documented, that is now impacting the student's course work. An appeal can be done through the Non-academic Counselors for consideration of Non-academic Q drop/s or Withdrawal based on this criteria.

CS 314H, which you will take during your first semester in the Turing Scholars Honors Program, will teach programming concepts found in a traditional second course in programming (data structures, program design, algorithms) and serve as a vehicle for exploring broader issues in computer science. \"The Process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially rewarding, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music.\" Donald Knuth, 1974 Turing Award Winner, Preface to The Art of Computer Programming \"Having surveyed the relationships of computer science with other disciplines, it remains to answer the basic questions: What is the central core of the subject? What is it that distinguishes it from the separate subjects with which it is related? What is the linking thread which gathers these disparate branches into a single discipline? My answer to these questions is simple \u2013 it is the art of programming a computer. It is the art of designing efficient and elegant methods of getting a computer to solve problems, theoretical or practical, small or large, simple or complex. It is the art of translating this design into an effective and accurate computer program.\" C. A. R. Hoare, 1980 Turing Award Winner CS 314H assumes one semester of programming. The language used in the course is Java. If you have had experience programming, but not with Java, you will find it useful to write some Java programs this summer. If you have never programmed before, trying to learn on your own is a decidedly difficult task. It is often easier to learn how to program in a structured environment like an organized class rather than trying to teach yourself. Getting Started with Java If you have had programming experience and want to learn Java here are some helpful resources. Download and install the latest Java Development Kit . Download and install an Integrated Development Environment if you want a program to help write, compile, and run Java programs. Check out Sun's Java Tutorials site for information about Java. Read through the Getting Started and Learning the Java Language threads. Not sure what to program? Check out Mike Scott's UIL Computer Science web page, and specifically the written portions of past years' contests .",

Since I had completed a summer internship prior to my freshman year at UT with several of my Pod-mates, I had the opportunity to further forge and deepen those connections through sharing classes and participating in Pod activities with those amazing people. Whether it be throwing late-night pizza party study sessions in the library before an exam, goofing around constantly through Discord, going to fun social events with fellow CS majors in my spirit organization, or simply having a support network for when I struggle with assignments or stress, being able to go through the CS program with my best friends has been the highlight of my UTCS experience so far! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I could go back to when I was coming into UTCS, I would establish a core support group of other CS majors sooner than later. A support group can be there for group study sessions, working together on understanding UTCS coursework, and hanging out in between classes. When I started in UTCS, I thought I could go it alone, but having a core group of friends that get you can not only can be the best medicine to midterm season stress, but also can make you a better, more well-rounded person overall.

Keep in mind that the University imposes a residency requirement: In order to receive an undergraduate degree you must complete 60 hours in residence at UT Austin. CNS information for incoming students Question: What type of computer should I buy? We get this question often from prospective students, so we asked our ambassadors, experienced CS students to answer: \"As far as computers go, every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use. The computer labs in Gates are open 24/7 for student use. Therefore, the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using. There is no departmental preference between Windows, Mac, Unix, or Chrome operating systems. In terms of hardware, few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics, most students use the computers in the labs. Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class, so laptop use in class would likely only be for non-CS courses and would probably consist of note taking. [For example, a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems.] While having a laptop in college is not a requirement, I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room. As for the type of computer, the best, short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using, because you won't have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn't be able to do on a lab computer (besides take notes in class). It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use. For example, a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming. If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network (and etc), they typically choose to work in the labs. There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops, but it's definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming, not because it's a requirement of the major. This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class.\" Undergraduate Undergraduate Admissions Prospective Students Internal Transfers Schedule a Visit Turing Scholars Honors Program X+CS Integrated Degree Program Academics Student Support",

Coursework that covers the background topics through any combination of: Courses taken prior to admission. Background courses named above may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class. Student receives a B or better on Final exam(s) of UTCS undergraduate background courses. Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements.\u00a0 Please see the pre-2016 background coursework form and checklist for a list of previous background coursework. Research Immersion Every PhD student is expected to spend a substantial amount of time on research, starting from the first semester. Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program. (Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall.) As part of this class, students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year; each PhD student must always have a research supervisor. In each subsequent semester, until admission to candidacy, a PhD student must enroll in and complete a CS 395 Conference Course (research course) with a research supervisor. Please submit the necessary form to the graduate office at the start of each semester. Doctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor. Such permission is rarely granted. Diversity Program The goal of the Diversity program is to expose students to different research styles and methods from various areas of computer science. The Diversity program requirements are waived for students who either receives a Master's degree in computer science before enrolling at UT Austin, or who receives a Master's degree from UTCS during the course of their PhD program. All Diversity course waivers are subject to the approval of the UTCS GSC. All other students are required to take one Diversity course from each of three areas: Theory Systems Applications See \"Diversity Courses\" for a list of the approved courses that are offered in each area. Courses used to satisfy the Diversity requirement should be completed with a grade of B- or better, and a combined grade point average of 3.5 must be achieved on the three (3) courses used to satisfy the Diversity requirement. An overall grade point average of 3.1 must be maintained on all Diversity courses taken. Additional Diversity courses may be taken as part of the Depth program. Diversity courses may not be taken CR/NC due to the GPA requirements. Diversity Course Waivers may be used to fulfill the Diversity program requirements. A Diversity Course Waiver is granted when: (1) a student has taken a graduate-level course at another university and that course is equivalent to a UTCS Diversity course, and (2) the student is able to demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of this material to a Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) member who teaches the Diversity course. To request a Diversity Course Waiver, the student should contact the GSC member and provide them with the prior course syllabus and other supporting materials. The GSC member may choose any method to evaluate the student's knowledge: a written or an oral examination is possible. The GSC member sends an email with their approval of the Diversity Course Waiver to the CS program coordinator for final approval at the next GSC meeting. All Diversity Course Waivers are subject to the approval of the UTCS GSC. Note: Doctoral students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2018 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous Diversity program. Please see the pre-2018 PhD Program for a description of the earlier Diversity Program requirements. Depth Students satisfy this requirement by taking at least 3 graduate courses related to their particular research interests. At most one of these courses may be outside the Computer Sciences Department; they are usually chosen from the CS department's list of graduate classes. No course used to satisfy the minor requirement for the Master's may be used. Courses listed as Diversity courses may be used as part of a Depth program as long as they were not also used in the student's Diversity program. No CS 395 Conference Course or CS 398T course may be included in a Research Qualification (RQ) document. All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better. A grade point average of 3.6 over all Depth courses must be attained. Research Preparation Exam The Research Preparation Exam requires students to learn and demonstrate specific skills necessary to do research early in their careers.\u00a0 Schedule a room for your RPE through the online calendar . When the administrator has approved your request, you will receive an email confirming the approval. After you have confirmed your room request please send the information\u00a0for your RPE to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu in the format outlined below.\u00a0 The CS faculty and students will then be notified. Research Preparation\u00a0Exam: [FULL NAME] Date: Time: Location: Committee Members: Title: Abstract: For this exam, the student (in consultation with faculty) selects and conducts research on a topic, and presents a talk, to be approved by a committee of 3 UT GSC faculty members. The chair of the RPE committee should be a CS GSC member and one of the committee members should be from outside the student's research area. The committee will evaluate the student with respect to two questions: A student should pass the exam by the end of their 3rd year in the PhD program (before filing the Research Qualification document). It is not necessary to complete all coursework before doing the RPE. Following the RPE, an email should be sent by the chair of the committee to the graduate advisor and the CS graduate program coordinator with a copy to all committee members indicating the student successfully completed the RPE requirement. Research Qualification (RQ) Document The RQ document may be downloaded from the Forms Bank .\u00a0 In the RQ document, the student: The RQ document must be filed by the end of the 3rd year in the PhD program. Dissertation Proposal and Advancing to Candidacy Each student must prepare a written dissertation proposal and then give an oral public presentation of the proposal. This will normally happen soon after the RQ document is filed.\u00a0 Please see advancing to candidacy for more information on this requirement. Dissertation Final Defense Each student writes a dissertation that describes original research and submits it to the members of the dissertation committee. There are many resources available to assist in writing a dissertation. Please see final defense to read the steps for the defense. Additional Requirements A minimum grade point average of 3.0 must be maintained over all CS graduate courses. All course requirements must be completed within a six-year period. There is a two-semester requirement for PhD Candidacy. A student may enroll in a summer session as part of the 2 semester enrollment requirement. The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires a minimum of thirty semester hours of coursework, including dissertation hours. The Requirements of the Graduate School The Graduate School maintains additional academic & registration policies , which must be followed by all CS graduate students. These policies address such issues as grades & credit, courses taken in residence, transfer credit, and time limits. If you are unsure about a requirement, please speak with the CS graduate office. Parallel Masters Study Computer Science PhD students may also pursue the MSCS degree as long as it does not interfere with their pursuit of the doctorate.

    "text_content": "Summer Preparation: Logic & Formal Reasoning | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Turing Scholars Incoming Turing Students Summer Preparation: Logic & Formal Reasoning Logic is the foundation of mathematics and of programming.  CS 311H, which you will take during your first semester in the Turing Scholars Honors Program, will introduce you to logic as a language for thought, as well as techniques for using logic to prove theorems.  It will also introduce you to basic ideas of sets, functions and relations.  The class will start at the beginning, but it will move quickly, so you will have a much easier time in the class if some of the concepts are already familiar to you. First, for motivation, you might want to take a quick look at Mathmatics as a Language .  It should dispel any doubts you have about the importance of logic as a language for concise, precise communication. You may want to spend some time this summer getting comfortable with the basic notions and concepts of logic, sets, and functions. To help you do that, we've put together a set of resources for learning about them. Along the way, you might enjoy trying some fun games to test your logical reasoning skills. No formal notation required for these. Just clear thinking. Logic Resources One way to learn logic is to read a book.  A very good book, which starts at the beginning and moves through to quite advanced concepts is Learning to Reason: An Introduction to Logic, Sets and Relations by Nancy Rogers.  It is targeted specifically at computer scientists, so it contains lots of examples of direct relevance to computer design and to programming.  But you don't need to spend the summer reading books.  The web is full of great resources for getting experience with the basic notions of logic, sets, and functions.  Check out Wikipedia's articles on: Propositional logic First-order predicate logic Set theory and Mathmatical sets Binary relations Logic Games There are some classic (meaning so simple they were around way before modern computers and fancy graphics) games and puzzles that can give you a chance to test your reasoning skills.  In all of these games, problem solving can be described as state space search.  At each move, you must choose from a fairly small (by the standards of living in the real world) set of legal moves.  Since any complete solution is a sequence of such moves, one way to think about finding a solution is to think something like, \"Suppose I choose A first, then B, then C.  Will I win?\"  Or, of course, you could try, \"Choose A first, then B, then D.\"  And so forth. There are two important things if you want to solve problems like this reasonably efficiently: Most importantly: Try your options systematically so that you don't waste time trying redundant paths and you don't miss promising ones. Use whatever constraints are available to rule out some paths without actually having to try them all. Try these.  Remember, the goal is not just to get an answer but to get one in as few steps as possible.  Think about what you're doing.  Can you write out reasons for the moves you choose?

Is this program right for you? Consider the following questions. If you can answer \"Yes\" to some, do consider applying. Do you enjoy solving problems of all sorts? Do you enjoy mathematics? Do you appreciate well-crafted proofs? Do you get a thrill when you're finally able to crack a hard math problem? If you've taken a computer science or programming class, did you love it? Do you get a thrill when you get your computer program to work correctly? Do you enjoy your science classes? Notice that we did not ask the following questions: Do you spend at least eight hours every day in front of a computer? Have you figured out how to hack into your school's computer system? Have you programmed at least five different games in the last year? Have you been using computers since before you could read? Most high school students have not had a chance to explore computer science. While it's true that many successful applicants could answer \"yes\" to some of this second set of questions, many others could not; they do, however, have a talent for math, for working with formal systems, and a love of solving hard problems. Computing is an equal opportunity field. There are outstanding computer scientists of any gender and all ethnic groups. We particularly encourage applications from women and other underrepresented populations.",

The UT Department of Computer Science offers informational tours for its undergraduate computer science programs throughout the year, including an honors tour focusing on the Turing Scholars program as well as Texas CSB (CS + Business honors). During your time on campus, you will have the opportunity to tour our state-of-the-art computer science facilities, attend a class, meet with an academic advisor, chat with a current student, and, if you sign up for the honors tour, visit with Professor Calvin Lin, the Director of the Turing Scholars program. Students interested in honors visits are encouraged to come in the Fall when they can attend a first-year honors course. Spring visitors will need to visit a traditional, rather than an honors, class. Note that during the Spring semester, priority is given to admitted students. Please visit the CS website for more information and to schedule a tour. How do I apply? High school seniors can apply to the Turing Scholars Honors Program alongside the standard UT Austin application, as long as they select Computer Science as either their first or second choice major. The honors application process includes short-answer questions and an expanded resume and can be completed within the Common Application, or on UT Austin's MyStatus page after submission of the UT Austin application. We're looking for highly motivated students with strong math and science backgrounds. A demonstrated interest in computer science through classes or personal projects is a plus, and evidence of leadership as exhibited by significant extracurricular involvement is also helpful. For more information about applying to freshman honors, visit the Texas Admissions page . For Current UT Students If you are interested in joining the Turing Scholars Honors Program and have excelled in your current CS and math courses at UT, please consider the following options: Join the Turing Scholars program Current CS majors can apply for admission to the Turing Scholars Honors Program at the end of each semester by submitting an online application and then emailing a resume to the address on the online application. Applications will be accepted through May 17, 2024 for students wanting to begin the program in Fall 2024 . Enroll in individual honors courses Our CS honors courses typically have a limited number of spaces available for non-Turing Scholars. Enrollment in honors courses is particularly useful for students who wish to transfer into the Turing Scholars Program, since they give the admissions committee an excellent way to evaluate your potential. To apply, you should submit a separate request for each CS honors course that you wish to take, since the decisions are made by the individual faculty members who teach the course. In some cases, faculty may ask you to also make an appointment for an interview. Turing Scholars Turing Scholars Why Turing?

You will not only get a tour of UTCS but also meet current Turing Scholars and see what it is like to attend an honors class lecture. In February of every year, we host goto_Turing , an event where we invite admitted students to come visit and learn more about the program. We host live Q&A\u2019s with current Turing Scholars and faculty on the Turing curriculum, community, and career opportunities. You can also get the feel of an honors course from a sample lecture with one of our honors course professors. We highly encourage admitted students come before making a decision on whether to attend the program. Summer Preparation During your first semester in the Turing Scholars Honors Program you will begin studying the two foundations of computing as a science: Discrete Maths (CS 311H) Data Structures (CS 314H) We have accepted into the program a diverse group of students. You all show exceptional academic promise. But your backgrounds differ widely. The purpose of this page is to give each of you the opportunity to spend some time over the summer, before you come to UT, filling in holes in your prior experience and enriching your understanding of the depth of computer science as an intellectual discipline. The suggestions we offer here are divided into three areas: \u00bb Programming in Java An introduction to object-oriented programming in Java. We describe a basic set of skills we hope everyone will have at the beginning of CS 314H. We suggest that you review that list and then follow the suggested study guide if your background seems weak. \u00bb Logic and formal reasoning An introduction to formal logic and proof techniques. Although no specific formal background is required for CS 311H, prior familiarity with the main concepts will be a help. We suggest a couple of books you might want to look at, but mostly we list websites that contain tools that will let you practice some of the fundamental skills. You'll also find links to some logic games that you can use to hone your reasoning skills. \u00bb The Big Picture Key intellectual ideas in the history of computer science and other things that are fun to think about. We list here books that influenced our thinking about computing. We want to share them with you. None of them is required, but if you can find the time to read a few of them over the summer, you'll come to the program with a deeper understanding of why you're doing what you're doing.",

I remember Wednesday lunches with my Pod, karaoke nights in the dorms, and watching the sunrise from the Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge with my best friends. My advice to my freshman self is this: step out of your comfort zone and seize every opportunity to make lasting memories. Best place to eat in Austin? I\u2019m a sucker for anywhere I can get a good bowl of pasta, so my go-to places are Cipollina, Patrizi\u2019s, and North Italia! Megan Sickler Year in college: Sophomore Hometown: Plano, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: I loved taking Intro to Human-Computer Interaction under Professor Amy Pavel because it allowed me to explore the design side of the field! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Meet yourself where you are \u2014 no need to compare yourself to peers who might come into college with more experience than you. After your intro classes, the playing field will level out! Best place to eat in Austin? The waffles at Mary\u2019s Cafe are the best! Hanaa Siddiqui Year in college : Senior Hometown : Plano, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why : Meeting other CS students. About half of the cool useful things you learn in this program are from your own peers and upperclassmen. Also, working in groups (to the extent the professor allows collaboration) makes homework a little more fun :) What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Your health is important!! School is not more important than sleep and food. Best place to eat in Austin? P Terry's has a special place in my heart <3 Megan Sundheim Year in college: Senior Hometown: Austin, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS has been the small, tight-knit community I\u2019ve helped build with my friends from Pod! Since I had completed a summer internship prior to my freshman year at UT with several of my Pod-mates, I had the opportunity to further forge and deepen those connections through sharing classes and participating in Pod activities with those amazing people. Whether it be throwing late-night pizza party study sessions in the library before an exam, goofing around constantly through Discord, going to fun social events with fellow CS majors in my spirit organization, or simply having a support network for when I struggle with assignments or stress, being able to go through the CS program with my best friends has been the highlight of my UTCS experience so far! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I could go back to when I was coming into UTCS, I would establish a core support group of other CS majors sooner than later. A support group can be there for group study sessions, working together on understanding UTCS coursework, and hanging out in between classes. When I started in UTCS, I thought I could go it alone, but having a core group of friends that get you can not only can be the best medicine to midterm season stress, but also can make you a better, more well-rounded person overall. Best place to eat in Austin? Chuy's Mia Tey Year in College: Junior Hometown: Corpus Christi, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience so far has been running my own pod a year ago. I was able to have fun and really connect with my mentees. By sharing my experiences here and listening to their perspectives, it made UTCS feel more like home. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Everything works out in the end. Focus on connecting with your peers because you\u2019ll need them for support along the way. Most of all: HAVE FUN. Best place to eat in Austin? Basil Thai!! Tejaswi Thapa Year in College: Junior Hometown: Denton, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: One of my recent favorite experiences at UTCS was when me and some of my friends grabbed dinner together at the West Campus food trucks after the CS 439 final exam. Finishing my last final and wrapping up a grueling semesters was a bittersweet moment for me but I'm glad to have shared it with some of the people who were beside me along the way. Some of my other favorite experiences at UTCS are working on group programming assignments. My group's impressive ability to set up shop at any place on campus while still finding moments to chat and laugh has been the most memorable part of my semester. Another one of my favorite experiences has been watching my last pod cohort's students grow as the semester and year progressed. Seeing them branch out of their comfort zones, make new friendships, and find a sense of belonging at UTCS has been the most rewarding part of my role as a Pod Mentor. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Balance academics and social life! Both are essential to your overall experience at UTCS. Best place to eat in Austin? Titaya's Thai Cuisine Hima Tummalapalli Year in college: Junior Hometown: Carrollton, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: I've had many great experiences in UTCS so far. I've gotten to learn a lot through my classes, but also through hackathons and organizations like DiRP. Additionally, I've made some really close friends in this department who have been a part of my journey in CS thus far. I was also a pod mentor last school year, and I had a really good time welcoming the new freshmen into UTCS. I've had a lot of great experiences in UTCS, and I'm really grateful for them. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would probably advise myself to get more involved in organizations, especially freshman year. I found it hard to balance being in clubs while doing schoolwork, but I think I should have tried to do that better since getting involved in clubs can give you really good experience in skills that you may not be able to develop just from your classes. Nidhi Venigalla Year in College: Junior Hometown: Springfield, IL Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS has probably been the CS Pods. CS Pods helped me feel less alone my freshman year and get to know my peers and make new friends; I was really grateful for the community that CS Pods helped me find. Meeting new people in general has been one of my favorite experiences in UTCS; I've met some of my closest friends through UTCS and am so glad that I had the opportunity to! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Coming into UTCS, I was worried that I didn't know enough or knew less than others. I would tell myself that everybody feels this way, and that it is incredibly common to feel imposter syndrome and as if you know less than the people around you; I would tell myself that it is okay to feel this way, and that I should be proud of myself for getting to where I am. Best place to eat in Austin? Ramen Tatsuya! Chenyi Wang Year in College: Sophomore Hometown: Hangzhou, China Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS so far has definitely been the friends I was able to easily make during the first week of CS312. I remember sitting down next to four random people on the first day of lecture, those four ended up becoming my friends that I still hang out with in and out of school. We would study together before exams and always grab food before heading to the exam room, even hanging out and going to social events to decompress after. The people within UTCS are all incredibly driven and friendly and immersing yourself in that will provide you the best experience navigating through college life. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would say the biggest piece of advice I would give to myself had I known earlier is to give myself a set schedule. I remember stressing about assignments and spending hours just sitting down stuck on a single bug, working past the time I gave myself, and skipping things I had planned for myself such as going to the gym. However, once I told myself that I need to get up and do what I had originally planned, I felt much more efficient and was even able to finish the assignment after clearing my head. Best place to eat in Austin? I really recommend QI Austin if you\u2019re looking for the best dim sum in the city, though it is a little pricey. Gregory Zachariah Year in college: Sophomore Hometown: Sugar Land, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite CS experience so far is the ever-present community that is present. Coming into such a huge school and rigorous program, it felt quite easy to get lost in all the action. Regardless of what the next rigorous CS class I would be taking, the support system around me turned what would\u2019ve been a stressful semester into a period of inspiring mutual growth and memories. Whether spending my entire afternoon in office hours at GDC, working on pitching a product for an org, or depleting all my remaining dining dollars at Lucky Lab with friends, the inclusive environment fostered by the department and my peers was an aspect I never expected from UTCS. Being able to learn the ropes of such challenging courses with the help of the people I met along the way has helped to narrow down this massive student population into a community I can call my own. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I were to go back and give myself some advice coming into UTCS, it would be to embrace failure, expect things to not always work out on the first try, and not let disappointment dictate how you move forward. Best place to eat in Austin? Though I haven\u2019t had a chance to fully venture out into Austin\u2019s food scene, K-Bop is definitely a top contender for places to eat. Being relatively affordable and close to campus, their Beef Bulgogi bowls were a treat after a stressful few weeks of preparing for my CS exams. Batyr Zhangabylov Year in college: Sophomore Hometown: Atyrau, Kazakhstan Favorite C S experience so far and why : My favorite thing about UTCS has been the opportunity to be surrounded by such a talented and supportive community. From world-class professors to so many great students, everyone has been nothing short of friendly and supportive. There are people from all walks of life, making it a great collaborative but also a very welcoming environment for anyone joining. We have an extremely diverse and well-rounded cohort of people, which I believe is what drives success and makes each experience so memorable. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? One piece of advice I would give at the start of the year is to take advantage of all the opportunities on campus, but also make sure to prioritize and manage your time well. It can be easy to get overwhelmed when you first arrive at such a busy place with so many people, but you have a few years here, so there is no need to rush. Best place to eat in Austin?

    "text_content": "Curriculum | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Academics Curriculum The CS faculty revised the curriculum, because computer science has become too large to learn in four years. The faculty decided that the best response is to reduce the set of classes that students are required to take, so as to enable students to pursue their interests by choosing upper-division elective courses. The old curriculum had eleven CS courses that students were required to take, leaving little time for electives. The new curriculum has only six. This gives students the opportunity to dive into concentration areas , or to study computer science more broadly by sampling from various subareas. General Our Entry-Level courses and prerequisites require students to take our CS courses in a specific order for their first few semesters. You can see the flowchart below: Core CS Classes All CS students are required to take six core classes, two of each in Programming, Systems and Theory: Programming 1) CS 312 Intro to Programming 2) CS 314 Data Structures or CS 314H Data Structures: Honors Systems 3) CS 429 Computer Organization & Architecture or CS 429H Computer Organization & Architecture: Honors 4) CS 439 Principles of Computer Systems or CS 439H Principles of Computer Systems: Honors Theory 5) CS 311 * Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science or CS 311H * Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science: Honors 6) CS 331 * Algorithms & Complexity or CS 331H * Algorithms & Complexity: Honors *Starting in Fall 2013, CS 311 and CS 311H replace the old CS 313K Logic, Sets and Functions and CS 313H Logic, Sets and Functions.

    "text_content": "Programming and Computation Certificate | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Academics Programming and Computation Certificate Info Requirements Courses Substitutes Certification FAQ The Programming and Computation Certificate (formerly known as the Elements of Computing Certificate) is an 18-hour\u00a0program that helps students understand our everyday technologies and gain the computer skills valued by employers. The goals of the program are to: Provide students with knowledge of computer science that employers find valuable. Support study in other disciplines requiring computational proficiency. Programming and Computation courses\u00a0are intellectually stimulating and personally rewarding, and they can supplement any undergraduate program.\u00a0However,\u00a0these courses require excellent planning and time management. Students are encouraged to begin the certificate no later than their\u00a0freshmen\u00a0or sophomore year, as the certificate is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown and students do not receive assistance with registration. Please consider these factors when applying for the Programming and Computation Certificate. Only students officially pursuing the certificate will be able to register for these courses. Students who wish to enroll in these courses to meet requirements for their major or other credentials will need to find alternative coursework. Note : We are transitioning the certificate title from Elements of Computing to Programming and Computation. These are essentially the same certificate but with different names . The former is for students on catalogs older than 2024 while the latter is for students on the 2024 catalog or later. The language on this website will reflect the new name, but the information applies to both certificates. Applying for the Certificate: For students on a catalog prior to 2024 (contact your advisor if you're not sure): Step 1 :\u00a0Navigate to the Minor/Certificate Application Step 2 :\u00a0Select \u201cCS Computer Science\u201d in the dropdown menu, and then \u201cELEMENTS OF COMPUTING (CTEC\u00a0S01)\" Step 3 :\u00a0Once you have received a confirmation SAN, please contact your academic advisor\u00a0and ask that the Elements of Computing certificate be attached to your degree profile *** This is an important step in the process!

The certification survey and other important certificate information is sent via the\u00a0certificate listserv. Students are encouraged to join the listserv here . For any inquiries related to the certificate and its courses, email cs-certificate@austin.utexas.edu with your name and EID. To earn the Programming and Computation Certificate, you must: Be a current undergraduate student at UT Complete the two introductory courses, CS 303E and CS 313E, in-residence at UT Austin* Apply for the certificate (see steps on the Info tab, making sure to complete Step 3) Confirm that the certificate is marked as \"Pursuing\" Complete and pass all required coursework (6 total) with a C- or better letter grade, using no more than two substitutes for the certificate It is also suggested that students have at least 4 semesters left for their degree before beginning the certificate . These courses are very popular, and students should expect to take approximately 1-2 courses per semester. Only students officially pursuing the certificate will be able to register for these courses. Students who wish to enroll in these courses to meet requirements for their major or other credentials will need to find alternative coursework. How to confirm that the certificate is Pursuing: After you have applied for the certificate and received a SAN of approval, contact your academic advisor and ask them to attach the certificate to your degree profile If the certificate shows \u201cYes\u201d under \u201cPursuing\u201d for the Programming and Computation Certificate, you will have access to register for or waitlist the upper-division electives if you meet prerequisites If the certificate shows \u201cNo\u201d under \u201cPursuing\u201d for the Programming and Computation Certificate AND your advisor has already attached the certificate, please email cs-certificate@austin.utexas.edu with your name and EID so the effective date can be updated *There are two exceptions to students taking CS 303E in-residence. These will not count toward the two-course substitute limit. Testing out of CS 303E Having credit for CS 312, whether in-residence, with AP credit, or with transfer credit Expectations The Programming and Computation Certificate requires 18 hours of coursework (i.e. 6 courses): two lower-division core courses and 4 upper-division electives. The two lower division courses, C S 303E and C S 313E, must be taken in the Department of Computer Science at UT.* Students will choose the remaining 12 hours of coursework from the list of upper-division electives below. The upper-division electives may vary semester to semester. Students will be able to register for two upper-division electives\u00a0during the initial\u00a0registration period, but this is very difficult due to demand. This certificate is very popular and course capacity is limited. For students to successfully complete the certificate, we recommend that students have at least 4 semesters left for their degree before beginning the certificate \u2014i.e. students should begin no later than the spring semester of their sophomore year and expect to take approximately 1-2 courses per semester. To support their progress, students may want to consider: Testing out of CS 303E or CS 312 (the majors-level equivalent) Taking Programming and Computation courses in the summer Reviewing our pre-approved substitutes via the link on our Substitutes tab Lower Division Requirements (must be taken in-residence)* : CS 303E: Elements of Computers & Programming CS 313E: Elements of Software Design (requires\u00a0CS 303E) Upper Division Electives : CS 323E: Elements of Scientific Computing CS 324E: Elements of Graphics & Visualization CS 326E: Elements of Networking CS 327E: Elements of Databases CS 329E Topic Courses (students may take more than one of these courses for certificate credit) Elements of Data Integration Elements of Data Visualization Elements of Mobile Computing Elements of Web Programming Elements of Data Analytics Elements of Game Development CS 330E: Elements of Software Engineering I CS 331E: Elements of Software Engineering II (requires CS 330E) *There are two exceptions to students taking CS 303E in-residence. These will not count toward the two-course substitute limit. Testing out of CS 303E Having credit for CS 312, whether in-residence, with AP credit, or with transfer credit Two (2) substitutes are allowed for the upper-division electives. Students can choose from a list of automatically approved courses (link below) and/or request a course of their choosing.\u00a0Paperwork or petitions are not required for these pre-approved courses. Courses\u00a0that are not pre-approved must be reviewed and approved by the Programming and Computation faculty advisor, and credit is not guaranteed. Substitutes are not allowed for the two lower-division courses, C S303E and C S 313E. These courses must be taken in the Department of Computer Science at UT.* Click here for a list of pre-approved course substitutions NOTE: Some of the substitutes in the above PDF overlap with a specific Programming and Computation course. You cannot use both the original Programming and Computation course and its substitute for the certificate, even if your audit says otherwise. Students will not receive their certificate if there is overlap in their courses. If a student would like to petition a non-approved substitution course for the Programming and Computation Certificate, they must complete the DocuSign\u00a0form (unavailable during peak times such as the the start of classes and registration). Do not email Programming and Computation advising directly with this form and do not change the recipient of the DocuSign . Before beginning\u00a0the DocuSign process, please confirm that:\u200b You are at least halfway through completing the course and can expect\u00a0to receive\u00a0at least a C- letter grade You have\u00a0applied for the certificate\u00a0and are shown as pursuing (see the Info tab for full steps on this process) For transfer courses: the course has been\u00a0successfully transferred\u00a0to UT and is\u00a0reflected on\u00a0your\u00a0UT record These petitions are not guaranteed for approval and cannot be appealed. The student will receive a notification via DocuSign once the course is evaluated as well as a separate SAN if the course is approved. *There are two exceptions to students taking CS 303E in-residence. These will not count toward the two-course substitute limit. Testing out of CS 303E Having credit for CS 312, whether in-residence, with AP credit, or with transfer credit Students can receive a digital certificate confirming completion of all requirements for the Programming and Computation Certificate. To receive the certificate, students should fill out the survey below in a) the semester they are graduating or b) the semester that they are completing the certificate - whichever is later . Online Certification Request Form .* Students will be awarded their digital certificate and an accompanying letter within one month of the semester submission deadline (listed below). These items will be sent to the email provided by the student in the survey. Certification Request Submission Deadline: Spring:\u00a0May 1 by 5 PM Summer:\u00a0August 1 by 5 PM Fall:\u00a0Dec 1 by 5 PM *Students who make their certificate Stand Alone (i.e., graduate with 9 or fewer hours left for the certificate and complete them within 1 year of their graduation) will submit the form in the semester they take their last Programming and Computation course. Contact cs-certificate@austin.utexas.edu if you are graduating and need to make your certificate Stand Alone. I am a senior. Can I get help joining a class or moving up the waitlist? The Programming and Computation Certificate is very popular and space is limited. Our website encourages students to start the certificate their sophomore year and to plan for approximately 1 class per semester. This specific certificate is not guaranteed under Senior Countdown. Therefore, students register independently, and we do not assist students in jumping the waitlist. I had a late registration time and wasn\u2019t able to join my preferred course. What can I do? You can: Join a waitlist Be flexible about your preferred course selection. Many semesters have a few courses that close quickly but one or two that remain open for longer Look at our pre-approved substitutes to see if you can get credit for similar courses in other departments (note that the certificate allows only 2 overall substitutes) Participate in the late-add process that begins at 8am on the 5 th class day of spring and fall. Information is sent via our listserv during the first few days of class. Why can\u2019t I register for a particular Programming and Computation course? The Programming and Computation Certificate is very popular and space is limited. If a course is shown as \u201cwaitlisted\u201d then all seats are taken and you will only be able to add yourself to the waitlist. If a course is \u201cclosed\u201d then the waitlist is full as well. In both cases students are encouraged to be flexible and have backups. Can I meet with a CS advisor to discuss the Programming and Computation Certificate? Students pursuing the certificate are encouraged to meet with their academic advisor to discuss\u00a0how the certificate can fit into their current degree plan. Questions\u00a0may be directed to cs-certificate@austin.utexas.edu . I am pursuing a different certificate and it has Programming and Computation courses listed. Can I still take the course(s) for my other certificate? Priority for the Programming and Computation Certificate upper division electives goes to students who are pursuing the certificate. Students pursuing other certificates should find alternate coursework. Can I substitute the lower division courses? Students must take CS 303E and CS 313E at UT Austin. The only exception is CS 312 (equivalent to CS 303E). Credit-by-exam is available\u00a0for both CS 303E and CS 312 through Testing Services . Alternatively, students can use CS 312 credit received through the AP Exam in Computer Science A\u00a0or attempt to register for CS 312 in a spring semester (when it is open to non-majors). *If a student took MIS 304, EE 312, BME 303, SDS 322 prior to Fall 2021 then they can receive credit for CS 303E. This will count toward the substitute limit (2). When should I start taking courses for the Programming and Computation Certificate? To have the best chance to finish the certificate by graduation, students should take at least one certificate course each semester beginning their sophomore year. The upper division electives have limited seating and students will not be given priority when registering. The certificate requires at least four semesters for students to complete with the current prerequisites in place. Can the certificate be made Stand Alone instead of being attached? The Programming and Computation Certificate will not be made Stand Alone unless a student is graduating. Otherwise, students will need to have the certificate attached to their degree profile and marked as \"pursuing\" to access the upper division electives. Can I finish the certificate after I graduate? Yes, student have up to one year to finish certificate requirements. Students need to have at least half of the certificate completed upon graduation because only nine (9) hours of certificate coursework can be taken after graduation. This information can be found with the UT catalog information. I am a graduate student. Can I earn the certificate? The certificate is only available to current undergraduates at UT. Graduate students will not be able to independently register for the Programming and Computation courses; they can participate in our late-add process on the 5th class day of fall and spring to see if there is space in the course. Graduate students can also contact the instructors about auditing the courses. Can Programming and Computation Certificate courses be taken pass/fail? To count toward the certificate, all Programming and Computation Certificate courses and any approved substitutions will need to be taken for a letter grade. Students will need to receive a C- or better for the course(s) to count for the certificate *Spring 2020, Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters are the exception since students were able to use pass/fail and COVID pass/fail exceptions for their courses What is the maximum number of Programming and Computation upper division electives I can take in a semester? Students will be limited to two upper-division electives during the initial registration period, with the opportunity to join waitlists once they become available. The maximum number of Programming and Computation upper-division electives a student can take is three, though this is highly unlikely due to demand. Can I take courses at another institution and have them count towards the certificate? If a student has already taken a course and would like to the faculty advisor to review it, they can submit a course substitution request . It should be noted that community colleges do not usually offer courses that will substitute for any of the upper-division electives. Study Abroad courses can be reviewed prior to taking them to ensure that they will count, but these courses will count as substitutions. How do I go about getting a transfer course evaluated as a course substitution? If the transfer course in question does not transfer directly as an approved substitution (i.e., as E E 3ADV), students will need to submit a course substitution request after the course has already been transferred to UT. The course must be on the student's academic record and student needs to have a C- or better in the course. Please read through and fill out the course substitution request , and follow the instructions on the form. The course will be reviewed by the Programming and Computation faculty advisor and the student will be sent a SAN with the results. There is not an estimated time for when students will receive this SAN, and the decision cannot be appealed if denied. Can I get a course reviewed prior to taking it at UT? No. Students can submit course substitution requests for courses that they have already taken and passed, or courses that they are currently enrolled in. Our faculty advisor will not review courses that a student has not yet taken. Can all CS courses count towards the Programming and Computation Certificate? No. The Programming and Computation Certificate courses (CS courses that end in E) are the courses they have been created for the certificate. Other CS courses do not automatically apply to the Programming and Computation Certificate and are reserved for CS majors (with the exception of CS 312, equivalent to CS 303E). I am no longer pursuing the Programming and Computation Certificate. Can you remove it from my degree profile? Yes, but first you will need to contact your major advisor to have the certificate \u201cdetached\u201d from your degree profile.

    "text_content": "Undergraduate Research | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Student Support Undergraduate Research UT CS is the largest top 10 CS department in the U.S. Our research program has the breadth you would expect from such a department. We have built an autonomous car, developed algorithms to map the tree of life, designed compilers for multicore architectures and examined ways to assure security and privacy on the Internet. We are ranked in the top 10 in the country in four research areas (Programming Languages, Artificial Intelligence, Systems and Theory). See the Department's research page for a more comprehensive description of our research program and to start finding faculty who work in the areas that interest you. What research involves: The Department of Computer Science actively encourages undergraduates to get involved in research. Your long-term career goal may be to become a software engineer, an entrepreneur, a professor, an industrial researcher, or a patent attorney. Regardless, an undergraduate research experience can be an eye-opening and rewarding experience. Research involves: Being innovative Accepting responsibility Taking risks Basking in the glow of a new result How to get involved in research: UT encourages all its students to get involved in research. The College of Natural Sciences has created a web page to help science students find research opportunities . There are two ways to begin your research at UT: Take a Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) course. EUREKA is a UT-wide effort to encourage undergraduate research. Check their site for additional opportunities. Find a faculty member and begin working on a project. Students generally do this during their junior and/or senior year, but there are opportunities for talented sophomores as well. Many faculty members require that students have taken one of their courses before joining their research teams. So you should start early to think about the area(s) you might want to do research in. Then take the relevant classes. How to fit research in: Most students choose to get course credit for some of their research time. Research is for everyone. It prepares you for a creative career. But since many students may be thinking about research specifically because they know they want to go on to graduate school, we include here a link to our page on preparing for graduate school . All students are invited to become involved in our research activity. Students who are pursuing an honors degree (the Natural Sciences College's Dean's Scholars degree, the CS Department's Turing Scholars degree or Special Departmental Honors ) must complete an Honors Thesis that describes the results of a supervised research project. Visit the Honors Thesis Archive to get an idea of the breadth of the work our students do. The UT Undergraduate Research Journal is a student-edited and published multidisciplinary journal. Its purpose is to highlight the research and independent studies of undergraduate students at UT.

    "text_content": "Laptop Encryption | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Facilities Laptop Encryption University policy requires all UT-owned laptop computers (as well as personally-owned laptops containing Category I data) to have their contents encrypted. This policy is intended to secure sensitive data and to prevent its release in the event of theft or loss. Encrypting your laptop's contents is mandatory if the machine is UT-owned or contains Category I data. STEP 1: Backup! Backing up your laptop's data is critical for this process. Once the data is encrypted, if the encryption key (or password) is lost, the contents cannot be retrieved. If there is a serious hardware or software failure during the encryption process, the contents could be lost. Be sure to perform a full system backup of your laptop's contents before installing the encryption software . The Computer Science Department offers a free service for backing up user data on portable computers purchased on departmental funds, using CrashPlan Pro Enterprise software. Information about this service and software downloads are available at the portable computer backup service page. The service is designed for backing up the files contained in the user's home directory, not a complete snapshot of the entire disk including operating system. For this reason, we recommend that you have a separate system backup image before encrypting your disk. The service is free for use by CS Department faculty, staff, and graduate students. For maximum safety, if the CS Department staff is encrypting your UT-owned laptop, we will make a snapshot image of the drive before proceeding. You should still have a regular backup system in place regardless. STEP 2: Encrypt The ISO has provided a list of approved encryption solutions for UT use. If you decide to encrypt your laptop yourself, once you have downloaded the software for your computer, pick a time to install it when you can leave the computer plugged in and unused for several hours, and install the software. If your computer is owned by the University, the CS Department staff can perform the installation and initial encryption process on it. If you'd like us to perform this task, send mail to helpreq@cs.utexas.edu to arrange a time. STEP 3: Keep Backing Up Now that your laptop is encrypted, it's important to keep current backups of its contents. If something happens to the disk, you don't want to lose any changes you've made since the installation of the encryption software. We are happy to assist with this process. If you have questions about the laptop encryption process or what will be required of you, please send mail to helpreq@cs.utexas.edu .",

Daniel Gregory (Danny) Toole University of Texas at Austin Computer Sciences student, Daniel Gregory Toole, 20, passed away unexpectedly in a tragic accident Sunday, October 21, 2007. Danny was in the Vanguard program for gifted and talented students at Herod Elementary School in Houston, and was also in the SPIRAL program in Spring Branch ISD. Then he attended Cornerstone Academy and Memorial High. He had planned to become a software entrepreneur and pursued that goal through participation in Turing Scholars, an elite honors program for University of Texas computer science students. In the summer of 2007, he was employed as a software engineering intern at BorgSolutions, Inc. in Austin, Texas. As a young boy, Danny showed keen mechanical and logical abilities, which he demonstrated with Lego Robotics, K'Nex, and other building sets. He built and programmed his own Lego Robotics robots, and designed and built his first computer from parts he bought at Fry's at age 13. Danny was also interested in politics, philosophy, music and the human condition. He loved bicycling and took part in many bicycle rallies. Danny is survived by his parents, Shaun and Nan Toole; as well as his brother, Eric Toole. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to: The Danny Toole Memorial Turing Scholarship.

    "text_content": "Academics Undergraduate Degrees | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Academics Overview of CS Degrees The CS Department offers five undergraduate degrees (more information on the degree plans ): Bachelor of Science ( BS ): Requires more mathematics, science, and computer science than does the BA. Bachelor of Science and Arts ( BSA ): Includes a built-in minor or certificate and broader liberal arts and humanities choices than the BS. Will be available to students beginning Fall 2014. Bachelor of Arts ( BA ): Can more easily be pursued in combination with other degrees, majors, or special programs. Allows more social science, language, and cultural classes than the BS. Bachelor of Science ( BS ) - Turing Scholars: An honors BS program for students admitted to the Turing Scholars program. Bachelor of Science ( BS ) - Teaching: Offered through the College's UTeach program and designed for students who want to pursue careers as secondary school CS (and optionally mathematics) teachers. Integrated BS/MS: Enables highly motivated students to earn two degrees, a BS in CS and an MS in CS, in five years. Degrees and Career Paths Students often ask the question, \"Is the BS, BSA, or BA right for me?\" There is no one right answer. All three degrees will prepare students to work in industry or to go on to graduate school. If you are interested in starting out in industry, it is important to note that the greatest single factor in obtaining desirable jobs upon graduation is having previous work experience. Other important factors include a strong academic record, good communications skills and leadership experiences. If you are intending to go on to graduate school, either degree will provide the background necessary to enter a graduate program in computer science. Be sure to talk to your advisor about the courses you should take to prepare for the GRE. Undergraduate research is a key component of preparation for graduate school, and fits within the structure of all degrees. View differences between the BS, BSA, and BA . Other Ways to Study Computing at UT Some students who are interested in studying computing may also want to consider other programs at UT. If you are not sure whether one of the following computing programs is right for you, find out more information here: Electrical and Computer Engineering (in the College of Engineering ) Management Information Systems (in the McCombs School of Business ) UT offers a variety of Concentrations that augment the standard degrees. Click here for information on the programs that are often of interest to CS students. UT allows students to declare two \" simultaneous majors \" (usually called a \u201cdouble major\u201d). If you are interested in exploring the use of computing in some other area, you may want to consider this option. You will need to look at the website of the school in which you'd like to double major and contact their advising center for more information.

    "text_content": "Why Turing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Turing Scholars Why Turing The Turing Scholars Program is unique. By serving a small number of truly outstanding students\u2014we typically matriculate about 50 first-year Turing Scholars each fall\u2014we are able to provide an outstanding learning experience that combines the resources of a large university with the benefits of a small community. In particular, our goal is to recruit the best students from around the country, to give them special opportunities, and to produce the high tech leaders of tomorrow. And our program's small size allows us (1) to offer stimulating and challenging honors courses that even small private schools cannot offer, (2) to provide significant faculty contact and guidance, and (3) to foster a supportive community in which students learn from each other and inspire each other. In short, our program is designed to encourage students to do truly amazing things, both during their college career and beyond. Benefits Strong Community One of the most important aspects of our program is our community. Turing Scholars bond and make lifelong friends by taking small challenging honors courses as a cohort. This bonding is facilitated by small honors class sizes\u2014typically 30-60\u2014at a time when CS class sizes around the country are booming, even at small private schools. Students also have many opportunities to get to know faculty, and students can form particularly strong relationships with faculty through undergraduate research. This close-knit community extends beyond the classroom, as the Turing Scholars Student Association organizes regular events, such as brunches with professors, potlucks, and excursions into the city. Austin Austin is a vibrant city that has been the fastest-growing major metropolitan area in the US for nine straight years. With its young well-educated population, its booming tech industry, and its bustling music and cultural scene, Austin serves as a great backdrop for a college experience. Honors Housing In their first year at UT, most Turing Scholars choose to live in UT's Honors Living Community, comprised of the four halls in the Honors Quad (Andrews, Blanton, Carothers, and Littlefield) and populated by students from UT's various honors programs. Thus, the Honors Dorms allow Turing Scholars to form ties with some of the university's most talented students. Undergraduate Research Opportunities An important component of the Turing Scholars degree is an undergraduate honors thesis, which is structured like a miniature PhD thesis, with a faculty advisor who helps shape and guide the research and a committee of faculty members that approves the thesis based on the student's written thesis and oral presentation. While not always publishable, the thesis is intended to be a significant piece of work that is typically conducted over two or more semesters. The honors thesis is often a student's most meaningful component of their college career, and beyond the technical depth required, the experience helps students develop a host of important life skills, including critical thinking, written and oral communication, and organizational and executive skills. Career Opportunities Turing Scholars are highly sought after by industry. For example, freshman internships in the tech industry are rare, but with our aggressive first-year CS curriculum and our program's stellar reputation, about 75% of our freshmen find summer internships in the tech industry.Because our students have research experience, they are highly sought after by top graduate programs. Students interested in graduate school are usually admitted straight to PhD programs after their undergraduate degree. In recent years, students have gone onto top PhD programs in places like Stanford, MIT, UIUC, Berkeley, CMU and Cornell. Our most recent poll, conducted in 2019, shows that across our freshmen, sophomores and juniors, salaries for summer internships ranged from $20/hour to $95/hour, with a median salary of $50/hour. The same poll showed that the average compensation upon graduation was $148K (including stock grants but excluding signing bonuses). Our students who choose to pursue a PhD have enjoyed a tremendous record of placement in the top 10 PhD programs. Turing Scholars Turing Scholars Why Turing?

Finishing my last final and wrapping up a grueling semesters was a bittersweet moment for me but I'm glad to have shared it with some of the people who were beside me along the way. Some of my other favorite experiences at UTCS are working on group programming assignments. My group's impressive ability to set up shop at any place on campus while still finding moments to chat and laugh has been the most memorable part of my semester. Another one of my favorite experiences has been watching my last pod cohort's students grow as the semester and year progressed. Seeing them branch out of their comfort zones, make new friendships, and find a sense of belonging at UTCS has been the most rewarding part of my role as a Pod Mentor. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Balance academics and social life! Both are essential to your overall experience at UTCS. Best place to eat in Austin?

    "text_content": "Preparing for Graduate School | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Undergraduate Academics Advising Preparing for Graduate School Advancing your studies past the Bachelors degree can be a wonderful experience. Learning about the cutting-edge of the field and possibly doing research that moves the field forward can be very rewarding. Students often have questions about graduate school and hopefully this page and the associated links will help you figure out if graduate school is for you. What Graduate Degrees are Available? That depends on your field. In computer science, the primary graduate degrees are the Masters (MA or MS) and the Doctorate (PhD) in computer science. The Masters degree is comprised primarily of coursework that builds on your undergraduate work and better prepares you for industry or further graduate studies. It may involve writing a thesis. The Doctorate moves past the Masters course work to individual research in a specific area of computer science. A PhD is required for a career in academia. It also can prepare you for a career in industrial research. Some PhD programs require a Masters degree before you can be admitted; others accept students who have completed just a Bachelors degree. How do I Prepare? If you think you might want to go to graduate school, it is important that you start preparing early. Here is a list of things that are important for grad school admissions: The rigor of your undergraduate CS and mathematics courses Your undergraduate GPA Letters of recommendation, particularly from faculty members who know your work well Your GRE scores Your other CS experiences, including internships and research While your GPA is important to a graduate admissions committee, the committee will also look at several other factors. You will need to find between three and five faculty to write letters of recommendation for you. It is best if these faculty know you well. The best way to get to know a faculty member is to do an individual research project (CS 370 and possibly CS 379H). You should plan on starting this during your junior year so that your results can be reflected in your letters. You also need to take the general GRE exam. For some schools you will need to take the CS subject exam. You should take the CS subject exam as late as possible so that you can use what you have learned in all of your courses. To prepare for the CS exam, take a look at a sample test . Depending on the classes you have taken, you may need to fill in some gaps in what you have learned. Graduate School Preparation Graduate admission committees are looking for students who are likely to succeed in research. The best way to convince them that you are one of those students is to get involved in research as an undergraduate. See more on how to get involved in research . Documenting research requires technical writing skills. Students considering graduate school may want to prepare by enrolling for CS 234 - Technical Writing. This is a small class with lots of opportunity for individual attention that will help satisfy your substantial writing component requirement. What School Should I Go To? The answer to this question is very difficult. Your primary consideration should be a school at which you can succeed and accomplish your goals. Perhaps you want to go to a school that specializes in computer theory or maybe a school that is strong with no particular specialization. Once you have some idea of the area(s) that you may want to study, find a CS faculty member whose work is in that/those area(s). Go to office hours or ask for an appointment to talk about schools that are strong in your area(s). Paying for Graduate School Most PhD students are supported by their department or by an external fellowship. Many Masters students are also supported by their departments. As you are considering schools, you should look at their websites to find out what levels of support they offer to their students. There are also fellowships that are awarded by external organizations. If you receive one of these, you can take it to any school to which you are admitted: NSF Graduate Fellowships Fannie & John Hertz Foundation Fellowships Undergraduate Undergraduate Admissions Academics Advising Orientation Forms Preparing for Graduate School Concentrations Curriculum & Degree Plans Longhorn Startup Programming and Computation Honors Programs FAQ Student Support",

So it isn\u2019t surprising that you can study computing in many places at UT. If you are not sure whether you belong in the CS department or somewhere else, this page may help you. Computer Science The Computer Science department is located in the College of Natural Sciences . The foundation of computer science is algorithmic problem solving. Required CS courses introduce students to three core strands of the discipline: programming, theory and computer systems. Electives go beyond the core in all three areas. They also offer students the chance to study applications of the core principles. For example, we offer courses in software development, artificial intelligence, data mining, graphics, networking, computer security, cryptography, distributed systems, and computational biology. Electrical and Computer Engineering The ECE department is located in the College of Engineering . It offers two tracks, one in electrical engineering and one in computer engineering. The computer engineering curriculum places a stronger emphasis on hardware than does the CS curriculum. The computer engineering program is also strong in software engineering. Management Information Systems The MIS department is located in the McCombs School of Business . Its curriculum emphasizes solving business problems through the use of technology. Students learn business practices, functional disciplines, and computer applications. School of Information The iSchool's focus on front-end, human-computer interaction (HCI) complements the CS department's focus on back-end computing theory, algorithms, and systems. To provide interested students with an educational path toward mastery in both areas, we now offer a 5-year integrated program which allows highly motivated students with strong academic records to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Information Studies in only five academic years. In addition to this integrated program, the iSchool also offers an undergraduate minor (but no major), and their graduate classes are open to undergraduates by permission of the instructor.",

Later (usually as a junior or a senior), once you have chosen a faculty advisor and a research topic, there are two classes for which you may choose to register: CS 370 (Undergraduate Reading and Research): Students generally take this class during the first semester of their research activity. To be allowed to register for it, you will need to agree, with your faculty advisor, on a contract that spells out exactly what you will do and how your grade will be determined. CS 379H (Computer Science Honors Thesis): Students generally take this course after taking CS 370. Usually (but not necessarily) the thesis is an extension of the work that was begun in CS 370. To get credit, the student must complete an Honors Thesis, which must be approved by a committee of three readers. To register for this course you must receive permission from your supervising professor and the CS department honors advisor. For details on how to register for CS 370 or CS 379H, see your academic advisor .",

    "text_content": "Proposing and Advancing to Candidacy | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Graduate Ph.D. Program Proposing and Advancing to Candidacy With the assistance of your supervising professor, prepare a written dissertation proposal document and select a committee for approval by the graduate advisor. The committee must be composed of a minimum of 4 members, of which 1 must be someone whose teaching and research are principally outside of the department, and three members, including the supervisor, must be members of the CS department's Graduate Studies Committee ( GSC ). A committee can be composed of six members, provided at least 4 are members of GSC's, 3 from the CS GSC while 1 can be from another department's GSC. The Graduate Advisor must approve your committee prior to making final committee plans (an email message will do). Be sure what you send to the graduate advisor for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals. The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal. If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work, if substantially completed, would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work, then they will recommend admission to candidacy (#1 below) and sign the required form found under the forms section of the graduate tab. Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department's Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School. Select a date and time when all committee members can be present for the proposal. At least your research supervisor must be present at the proposal. It is allowable for the 3 others to attend the proposal virtually. A final draft of your proposal should be submitted to committee members four weeks prior to the date of the proposal. Schedule a room for your proposal through the online calendar . When the administrator has approved your request, you will receive email confirming the approval. The Graduate Coordinator will publicize your proposal. Approximately 3 weeks* prior to the date, you must give the graduate coordinator all the necessary information via email in the following format: PhD Proposal: [FULL NAME] Date: Time: Location: Committee Members: Title: Abstract: The graduate coordinator will then send out the public announcement two weeks prior to the date of the proposal. (*This is not a firm deadline, but the graduate coordinator does need to receive all the information at least several days in advance of the two-week deadline to send out the information. Pass the proposal exam. At least 3 members of the committee must be present at the exam, which may include questions over the entire depth area; it is not necessarily limited to the specific dissertation research topic. Questions from any GSC member are encouraged. The following criteria will be used to determine whether or not a student passes the exam: Does the candidate demonstrate knowledge of his/her depth area? If substantially completed, would the work described in the proposal constitute an acceptable dissertation? Does the student display the potential for substantially completing the work? Passing of the exam requires the unanimous approval of the committee on these three points. Be sure to obtain committee signatures on the \"Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form\" found under the forms sections of the graduate tab. If unanimous approval does not occur, a student may reform a committee or alter the topic. S/he is then required to retake the examination until unanimous approval is obtained. After passing your proposal exam and submitting the required \"Dissertation Proposal Committee Approval Form\" to the CS graduate office, you will need to complete an online Application for Candidacy . This form is now available through the Graduate School's website. You may begin the online application process before the proposal, but do not \"submit\" it until you pass the proposal. Once you submit an email will go to your research supervisor letting them know and they should approve it if you passed. If final approval is not received within a week of that please contact the graduate office for follow up. If you have any questions regarding completing the form, the Graduate Coordinator can help you. NOTE: It is not necessary to fill out the Program of Work form. This has been noted by the submission of your Depth Proposal or Research Qualification (RQ) Document. A curriculum vita for any member of your committee who is not a GSC member should be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator as soon as possible, either before or after completing the on-line candidacy form. You will receive official notification when the Dean formally admits you to candidacy. At the next registration/pre-registration or add/drop period, register or add/drop to _99W. If it is after the 4th class day contact the grad office to make the add/drop. NOTE: Enrollment in at least six hours of dissertation, C S _99W, is required. You must be in candidacy by mid-November in fall and late-March in spring in order to add/drop to dissertation hours in the same semester you advance to candidacy. For specific dates, please consult the CS graduate office. You must be enrolled in dissertation hours continuously in fall and spring semesters until graduation. You must be enrolled in _99W in the semester you plan to graduate. If that's summer then summer enrollment is required. What if Your Research Direction Changes After Your Proposal? In the event of a significant change in research direction, a student will be required to re-certify that each member of the committee continues to answer positively the three questions that determine whether or not the student passes the proposal exam. The committee may choose to require a public re-examination. A student's status in the PhD program is in jeopardy prior to the passage of such a re-examination.

Have questions?\u00a0Email: fiveyear@cs.utexas.edu Spring 2023 Application Cycle Information Session Recording Information Session Recording 2022 When does the application usually open/close? The application typically opens the first week of December and closes the last week of January. When should I apply? You are not eligible to apply to the program until you have been at UT (or other college/university) for 5 long semesters. This means you should plan on applying your junior year. Can I apply as a senior? You can apply, however, you will not be as competitive of an applicant since the program is designed to be combined with other degree requirements. If you are a senior, you may want to consider applying for a traditional master\u2019s program since it would take you about the same amount of time. I am currently a Turing student, can I still apply for the program and graduate with Honors? Yes, if you get accepted to the program you will not see Honors listed as your major at any point between then and graduation. It will be your responsibility to complete any remaining requirements for the Turing degree and have them completed before the end of Stage II. During your final semester, the Honors faculty will certify anyone who has completed the requirements, and you will be awarded the Honors designation. I applied for the program. When can I expect a decision? The decision timeline varies each semester, but you will likely hear back in mid to late April. How should I register if I don\u2019t know if I got into the program? You should plan on registering for any remaining courses you need to complete your undergraduate degree. If you get admitted to the program, the 5-year advisor will help you adjust your schedule to include the graduate courses you need. Can I complete the program early? No. Students can not apply until their 3rd year and do not start until the fall of their 4th year. 3 graduate courses (9 hours) is considered a full time schedule (as opposed to 12 in undergrad). You are restricted to 2 graduate courses per semester as an undergrad so you cannot \u201cspeed up\u201d the program or finish it early. Who should I reach out to with other questions?

    "text_content": "Pre-2018 PhD Degree Requirements | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Graduate Programs PhD Program Pre-2018 PhD Degree Requirements This page describes the requirements of the former PhD program. Students have the option of graduating under this program if their first enrollment as graduate students at UT was in Spring 2018 or earlier. Students must have an undergraduate degree in computer science or an allied field such as engineering or math with appropriate CS background to be admitted into the Ph.D. program. Each student who is admitted should satisfy the following requirements: Background The following UTCS undergraduate courses, or equivalent, are required as background (these are not prerequisites and can be met after admission): Discrete Math for Computer Science (CS 311) Introduction to Programming (CS 312) Data Structures (CS 314) Algorithms and Complexity (CS 331) Computer Organization and Architecture (CS 429) Principles of Computer Systems (CS 439) A student can satisfy the background requirement using one of the following options: Subject GRE in CS with score in at least the 90th percentile (last offered April 2013, ETS will report scores through Spring 2018) Coursework that covers the background topics through any combination of: Courses taken prior to admission. If these are not the UTCS background courses listed above, certification by an appropriate member of the UTCS tenure-track faculty is required. Background courses named above (or the equivalent honors courses) may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class. A B or better on the final exam in a background course may be substituted for a full course grade with certification by an appropriate member of the UTCS Tenure-track faculty. Courses certified by appropriate UTCS tenure-track faculty as covering equivalent material may be taken at UTCS or elsewhere by our graduate students. Certification must be obtained prior to taking the course. Note that this does not empower students to register for UTCS graduate courses if they do not meet the prerequisites for admission to those courses. UTCS faculty may certify a student as having covered required background material by interrogating the student\u2019s knowledge of the material directly. *Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements. Please see the pre-2016 background coursework form for a list of previous background coursework. Research Immersion Every PhD student is expected to spend a substantial amount of time on research, starting from the first semester. Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program. (Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall.) As part of this class, students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year; each PhD student must always have a research supervisor. In each subsequent semester, until admission to candidacy, a Ph.D. student must enroll in and complete a CS395 (Research Course) with a research supervisor. (Please submit the necessary form to the graduate office.) Doctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor. Such permission is granted rarely. Diversity Program The goal of the diversity program is to expose students to different research styles and methods from various CS areas. Each student must take one diversity course from each of five to seven different threads, with no more than two threads in each of the three areas: Theory Systems Applications See below for a list of the Diversity courses that are offered and their grouping into threads. Courses used to satisfy the Diversity requirement should be completed with a grade of B- or better, and a combined grade point average of 3.5 must be achieved on the 5 courses used to satisfy the Diversity requirement. An overall grade point average of 3.1 must be maintained on all Diversity courses taken. Additional Diversity courses may be taken as part of the Depth program. Diversity courses may not be taken CR/NC due to the GPA requirements. Diversity Course Waivers may be used to fulfill some Diversity requirements. A Diversity Course Waiver is granted when: (1) a student has taken a graduate-level course at another university and that course is equivalent to a UT-CS Diversity course, and (2) the student is able to demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of this material to a Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) member who teaches the Diversity course. The GSC member may choose any method to evaluate the student's knowledge: a written or an oral examination is possible. The GSC member sends an email with their approval of the diversity course waiver to the CS program coordinator for final approval at the next GSC meeting. At most one Diversity Course Waiver may be used in each Diversity area. The courses that are currently approved to fulfill the diversity requirement of the Ph.D. are shown below. There are three Diversity areas: Theory, Systems, and Applications, with at least four threads in each area. Ph.D. students must take 5 diversity courses from the 3 areas. These are to be listed on the Research Qualification form (PDF). The courses taken must fall within the following rules: Two courses from one area, two courses from a second area, and 1 course from a third area. Within the areas where 2 courses are taken, they must be from different threads. The threads are numbered below. It is permitted to take as many diversity courses as you need for your research with the approval of your supervising professor, but only the courses that follow these rules may be counted towards the degree plan.

Students who have taken these courses may still apply them toward their degree; however they cannot also get credit for CS 386D). CS 383C Numerical Anaylsis: Linear Algebra; CS 383D Numerical Analysis: Interpolation, Approximation, Quadrature,and Differential Equations 384G Computer Graphics; CS 384R* Geometric Modeling & Visualization; CS 384P Physical Simulation* 391L Machine Learning; CS 394N Neural Networks; CS 394R* Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice; C S 391D* Data Mining: A Mathematical Perspective CS 388* Natural Language Processing; CS 393R* Autonomous Robots; *CS 381V Visual Recognition CS 381K Artificial Intelligence; CS 393C* Agent-Based Electronic Commerce; CS 394F Knowledge Representation & Reasoning CS 394P Automatic Programming; CS 392F* Automated Software Design (formerly Feature Oriented Programming) CS 394C Algorithms for Computational Biology (Originally named Computational Biology) *These courses were originally taught as topic courses (CS 395T). Students should be aware that they will not receive dual credit for retaking the course under the new course number. Depth Students satisfy this requirement by taking at least 3 graduate courses related to their particular research interests. At most one of these courses may be outside the Computer Sciences Department; they are usually chosen from the CS department's list of graduate classes. No course used to satisfy the minor requirement for the Master's may be used. Courses listed as Diversity courses may be used as part of a depth program as long as they were not also used in the student's Diversity program. No CS 395 (conference) or CS 398T course may be included in a Research Qualification (RQ) document. All courses used to satisfy this requirement must be completed with a grade of B or better. A grade point average of 3.6 over all depth courses must be attained. Research Preparation Exam The Research Preparation Exam requires students to learn and demonstrate specific skills necessary to do research early in their careers. Please send the title, date, time, place, short abstract, and committee members for your RPE to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu when you have scheduled it. The CS faculty and students will be notified. For this exam, the student (in consultation with faculty) selects and conducts research on a topic, and presents a talk, to be approved by a committee of 3 UT GSC faculty members. The chair of the RPE committee should be a CS GSC member and one of the committee members should be from outside the student's research area. The committee will evaluate the student with respect to two questions: Has the student demonstrated scholarship and potential to conduct original research? Has the student demonstrated ability to communicate technical content effectively to a general-CS audience? A student should pass the exam by the end of their 3rd year in the PhD program (before filing the Research Qualification document). It is not necessary to complete all coursework before doing the RPE. Following the RPE, an email should be sent by the chair of the committee to the graduate adviser and the CS graduate program coordinator with a copy to all committee members indicating the student successfully completed the RPE requirement. Research Qualification (RQ) Document The RQ document may be downloaded from the Forms Bank. In the RQ document, the student: provides evidence of satisfying the background requirements submits coursework (5 Diversity courses completed and 3 Depth courses, some of which may remain to be taken) with satisfaction of the GPA requirements provides evidence of completing the Research Preparation Exam formalizes dissertation advisor(s) The RQ document must be filed by the end of the 3rd year in the PhD program. Dissertation Proposal and Advancing to Candidacy Each student must prepare a written dissertation proposal and then give an oral public presentation of the proposal. This will normally happen soon after the RQ document is filed. Please see advancing to candidacy for more information on this requirement. Dissertation Final Defense Each student writes a dissertation that describes original research and submits it to the members of the dissertation committee. There are many resources available to assist in writing a dissertation. Please see final defense to read the steps for the defense. Additional Requirements A minimum grade point average of 3.0 must be maintained over all CS graduate courses. All course requirements must be completed within a six-year period. There is a two-semester requirement for Ph.D. Candidacy. The first semester requires enrollment in _99R and the second semester requires enrollment in _99W. A student may enroll in a summer session as part of the 2 semester enrollment requirement. The Requirements of the Graduate School The Graduate School imposes a set of requirements on all graduate students, which must be met by all CS graduate students. These requirements deal with such issues as grades, courses taken in residence, transfer credit, and time limits. If you are unsure about a requirement please speak with the CS graduate office. Parallel Masters Study Ph.D. students may also pursue the M.S.C.S. degree as long as it does not interfere with their pursuit of the doctorate. The course requirements for an M.S.C.S., other than the background courses and two additional courses for a minor, are a subset of those for the Ph.D. Students must obtain approval of the graduate adviser and their research supervisor before taking a minor course. Send an email to the graduate adviser with a scholarly justification of the reasons leading to choosing the minor course(s). The student's research supervisor should send an email to the graduate adviser and copy the CS program coordinator indicating approval of the minor course(s) choice.",

    "text_content": "Coursework Option | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Graduate Master's Program Coursework Option Coursework Option (also called No Thesis/No Report) The list of courses required to obtain a degree is called the program of work. A total of 30 hours of coursework within 3 areas is needed to complete the program of work for the Master\u2019s coursework option. The Graduate Advisor approves the program of work prior to graduation. This checklist is available for planning and evaluating your program of work. Please see Course Information for current and future semester CS teaching plans. The information below is organized into five sections. Section 1 discusses background requirements. Section 2 discusses major coursework requirements. Section 3 discusses minor coursework requirements. Section 4 discusses additional requirements. Section 5 discusses transfer work. 1 - BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (not a prerequisite, can be met after admission) We acknowledge that other departments/universities divide up their curricula in different ways. The important thing is that approximately the same material has been covered. The decision about which courses you submit for review meet the background requirements is made by the faculty. The form is submitted to the grad office. The following UTCS undergraduate courses, or equivalent, are required as background*: Discrete Math for Computer Science (CS 311) Introduction to Programming (CS 312) Data Structures (CS 314) Algorithms and Complexity (CS 331) Computer Organization and Architecture (CS 429) Principles of Computer Systems (CS 439) Rules Any background requirements not met at the time of admission must be satisfied while enrolled in the Masters program. A common question is whether an undergraduate background requirement can be satisfied by taking the corresponding graduate course. Generally speaking, the corresponding graduate course assumes the undergraduate material as background, and so this approach is not permitted. That said, exceptions to this general rule are sometimes granted. A student seeking an exception should consult with the faculty member teaching the corresponding graduate course. One upper-division background course taken at UTCS as a graduate student may count towards your CS Major coursework. How to Complete Background Requirements Complete an undergraduate degree with a major in Computer Science prior to joining our graduate program; OR Coursework that covers the background topics through any combination of: Courses taken prior to admission. Background courses named above may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class. Student receives a B or better on Final exam(s) of UTCS undergraduate background courses. *Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements. Please see the pre-2016 background coursework form and checklist for a list of previous background coursework. 2 - MAJOR COURSEWORK REQUIREMENT (CS COURSES) 24 hours of major coursework \u2013 Please pay attention to the Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) rules written in #2 below. 9 hrs. of diversity courses, 15 hrs. of CS Graduate courses Rules for Coursework Option 9 hours of diversity courses - 1 course from each of the 3 areas - applications, systems, and theory. Passed with a grade of B- or better. 15 hours of any 5 CS graduate courses passed with a grade of C or better. One undergraduate upper division course may be substituted for 1 graduate course; however, no 'elements' courses may be used as a substitute. The undergraduate course may be taken either for a grade or CR/NC. Please remember background courses have a grade requirement so are not usually taken CR/NC. At most 3 hours of undergraduate coursework can count towards your program of work. It is possible to receive credit towards the MS degree for taking a CS 395 conference course (i.e., supervised research). However, students wishing to explore this possibility should bear in mind the following considerations. First, CS 395 is graded on a CR/NC basis, and at most one CR/NC course can be used towards the MS degree. (Exception: The MS thesis sequence CS 698A/B is graded on a CR/NC basis, and does not count against the one CR/NC course limit.) Second, a grade of CR is necessary but not sufficient to receive credit towards the MS degree. After assigning a grade of CR in the course, if the supervising professor feels that the student's work is strong enough to merit MS degree credit, they should send a statement to this effect to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu . The statement should include a brief summary of the student's accomplishments in the CS 395. How To Select Courses and Register The CS graduate department does not advise each semester, although you can visit the graduate office at any time with questions. You can seek information on classes from your peers, looking at course evaluation information and by going to course information . You can also attend the first day of classes and speak with the instructor. Personal registration dates and times can be accessed by going to your Registration Information Sheet ( RIS). 3 - MINOR COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS 6 hours (2 courses) in a minor: a supporting subject or subjects outside of computer science. Rules One minor course may be an undergraduate upper division. (At most 3 hours of undergraduate coursework can count towards your program of work.) One minor course may be taken on a CR/NC basis. (At most 3 hours of CR/NC coursework can count towards your program of work.) Graduate Adviser approval required. This must be obtained no later then the first 12 class days in Spring or Fall sessions and the 4th class day in Summer session. How To Obtain Approval and Register Email the graduate advisor directly explaining the importance of the course with a cc: to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu for minor course approval. Minor courses only count on your program of work with approval from the graduate adviser. Personal registration dates and times can be accessed by going to your Registration Information Sheet (RIS). 4 - ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS In addition to the requirements mentioned above, there are rules imposed by both the CS department and the Graduate School. These rules cover grades, courses taken in residence, transfer credit, time limits etc. Every student should read these rules soon after being admitted to the Masters program and make sure to satisfy them. The Graduate School specifies degree requirements in the Graduate Catalog that apply to courses counted toward a graduate degree. Read that information and make sure that you satisfy each item. We summarize below the graduate school and department requirements that most often affect CS students. A maximum of 3 hours of undergraduate classes may be counted for a 30 hr. masters degree. A minimum grade point average of 3.0 overall is required. All degree requirements must be completed within a 6 year period. Diversity requirement: 9 hours of diversity courses, one from each diversity area. Major requirement: additional CS courses as required for each degree. No more than 3 hours of courses may be taken on a CR/NC. To receive a Masters degree, a student must have been in residence at UT-Austin for two full semesters or equivalent. (see transfer work below) Courses in which a student earned a C- and lower or NC may not be counted on the program of work. 5 - TRANSFER WORK Rules The following rules apply to courses transferred from another institution: Only courses taken at major institutions within the United States may be transferred. CS Graduate Adviser and the Graduate school must approve the institution and course(s). Only graduate courses may be transferred. Courses designed for both graduates and undergraduates are generally not eligible for transfer credit. Only courses in which a grade of A or B was earned may be transferred. A maximum of two courses (6 hours) may be transferred. No course that counted toward a previous degree may be transferred. No transferred course may be used to satisfy a diversity requirement. To apply for transfer credit, a student must submit: A petition to the Graduate Advisor. The petition will also have to be signed by the Dean of the Graduate School. An official transcript that shows the course that is to be transferred. An official explanation of the course numbering system that is used at the institution at which the course was taken. A copy of the course description taken from the institution's catalogue or web site.

    "text_content": "UTCS Rules to Live By | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UTCS Rules to Live By The Computer Sciences Department is a community of scholars and students. Each of us thrives if the community thrives. Each of us thus has an individual responsibility to strive, not just for our own goals, but for the goals of the larger community. In this document, a group of the faculty have laid out a set of ground rules designed to make our department the kind of community in which we all want to live. If a professor in one of your classes has pointed you here, you should view this document as part of the syllabus for that class. As a Student, What You Can Expect from Your Department The CS Curriculum The faculty as a whole have the responsibility to formulate a curriculum that will prepare you for a lifetime of work in the field of computing. Yes, some of what you learn will get you a job right away. Some of what you learn may seem more esoteric and less essential. But remember that the faculty have lived through a lot of changes in the field. They've all had to learn new ideas, new programming languages, new architectures, and new applications many times (and without the aid of classes or textbooks). They've got a lot of first-hand understanding of the fundamental concepts that make it easiest to adapt as new things come along. Trust a bit and take advantage of this expertise. Try to like every class you take. Each Class that You Take The most important thing that each of your teachers should give you is a guided tour through the subject matter of the class. After all, you can go to the bookstore, buy books, read them, and write some code without ever signing up for a class. But, whenever you do sign up for a class, you have the right to expect that the instructor has read a lot of books, solved a lot of problems, and then chosen, from all of that material, 14 weeks of the most important ideas presented in the clearest fashion. You have the right to expect that every instructor will show up for class on time and be prepared to conduct the class. Responsiveness from the Instructional Staff In most of your CS classes, you will have an instructor, one or more TAs, and possibly a set of proctors. This group of people, working as a team, has the responsibility to do everything they can to help you learn. Your instructor, TAs, and proctors should treat you with respect and encourage you to seek help when you need it. Grades Publication of the Grading Policy: You have a right to be told, within the first four days of the semester, how grades in each class will be determined. You will be told what the basis of the grade will be and how much weight will be assigned to each component of the grade. In some classes, you may be told even more, for example, what numeric scores will be assigned what letter grades. But keep in mind that this isn't always possible. Classes that use different exams each semester may have very different score distributions from one semester to the next so it isn't possible to know in advance what thresholds make sense. Fairness: You have a right to expect that grades will be assigned fairly. Every student who turns in the same quality of work will receive the same grade. Feedback: You have a right to see your graded work and to understand what, if anything, was wrong with the work you submitted. Punctuality: You have a right to expect that exams and assignments will be graded in a timely fashion. It's hard to be more specific on this since the amount of time required to do a good job of grading depends so heavily on the kind of work and the staffing level of the class. One concrete thing you should expect is that you will have gotten some substantive feedback on your performance in each class before the Q drop deadline. As a Student, What the Department Can Expect from You Academic Honesty The University and the Department are committed to preserving the reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes: Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an instructor: Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor and other members of the instructional staff (TA, Section Leader or Lab Proctor). Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem or project that has been assigned. You are responsible for complying with this policy in two ways: You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly permitted by the instructor of each course. You must take all reasonable precautions to prevent your work from being stolen. It is important that you do nothing that would enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs. Do not share your work with anyone else. Make sure that you adequately protect all your files. Even after you have finished a class, do not share your work or published answers with the students who come after you. They need to do their work on their own. IMPORTANT: The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case to the Dean of Students Office. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the University may be imposed by that office. One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to assign individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the instructor's ability to assign grades. In these cases, your instructor will make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that class. Attendance at Classes and Exams Specific policies on class attendance will be set by individual instructors. Make sure you follow those policies. Whether you come to class or not, you are responsible for keeping up with what happens in class. If you miss a class (other than for illness or an emergency), it is not reasonable for you to expect your instructor or TA to repeat just for you the material that was covered in the class that you missed. This applies both to the content of the class as well as to announcements about class policies, events, deadlines, or whatever. Final examination schedules are published at the time of preregistration. If you are making end-of-semester travel plans, make sure that you will still be here to take each of your finals at the scheduled time. Travel plans are not a valid reason for missing an exam or asking for a special exam time. The policy on makeup exams will be set by individual instructors. Sometimes a makeup will be allowed, but many times it will not be. Except for emergencies, you must take each exam at its scheduled time unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor. Keep in mind that is often difficult or impossible for an instructor to create a separate makeup exam that is guaranteed to be of equal difficulty as the regular exam. Demands of a job or job interviewing are never valid reasons for missing a class (or a deadline or an exam). Classroom Behavior You have the right to learn in every class you attend. But you have the responsibility to help assure that every other student shares that right. Specifically: Come to class on time. Do not leave early. These things are very disruptive. Recognize that the buses and the parking space situation are unpredictable elements and allow for that. If you must come late or leave early (for example because of a doctor's appointment), let the instructor know in advance. Don't be disruptive during class. Don't chat with your neighbor or rustle the newspaper. Don't allow your electronic devices to be disruptive. Turn off your cell phone, beeper, and watch alarm. Participate. Academic Work outside the Classroom The only way to learn computer science is to do it. You should plan to spend a substantial amount of time outside the classroom working on each class that you take. For some classes, that will mean programming. For others, it may mean reading, studying, working problems, writing, or whatever. Don't let this work slide. It will not generally be possible either to do a programming project or learn the material in a theoretical class the night before the due date or the exam. You should be working on your own every week of the semester. A deadline is a deadline. Each instructor will publish the class policy for turning in late work. Plan your work accordingly. Don't push the deadlines and don't expect the instructor to do anything other than what has been published. Even five minutes is \"late\". Your instructor can't just acquiesce and accept your project five minutes late. Then what about seven or ten or fifteen or thirty? What about the other students in the class who had to miss some other event in order to get their work in on time? Is it fair to them to accept your work late? No. Plan that the printer will be down and the busses will be late on the day your assignment is due. Don't cut it down to the wire. And, if you do, accept the published consequences with grace. Faculty and Staff Interaction Your instructor, plus any TAs and/or proctors assigned to your class will work as a team to help you learn. But you need to interact with them in a reasonable way. Specifically: Remember that the instructional staff are a team. They will not all do everything. The instructor will tell you who will be responsible for what. Respect that. If you ask the wrong person your question, you probably won't get a reasonable answer and you will waste their time as well as yours. For many kinds of questions it really is better to ask the TAs or the proctors. This is particularly true of nitty gritty questions that arise in the labs, since the TAs and proctors are likely to spend more time there than the instructor does. It's their job. The University's electronic mail policy recognizes email as an effective way for your instructor and TAs to inform you about important things that may be happening in class. You are responsible for: Making sure that your instructor has a valid email address for you. If you do not want to use the one that the university has on record, then make sure to give your instructor another one. Reading your email every day. Guaranteeing that your mailbox does not overflow. Excuses such as, \"My email box was full\", \"I don't use that email address any more\", \"I was too busy to check my email\", \"I was on an interview trip and couldn't check my email\", or \"My computer crashed and all of my email was destroyed\" aren't acceptable. Email is also a very valuable way for you to communicate with your instructor and TAs. But be sure you use it appropriately. Specifically: Using email, it's easy to ask a question or make a comment that you'd never make in person. Be careful about this. If you think that what you're about to say wouldn't be something you'd feel comfortable going to office hours to say, you probably shouldn't say it in email either. In particular, do not send email to your instructor (or anyone else for that matter) when you're angry. You'll regret it when you calm down and you'll have antagonized someone who is important to you. Remember that the instructor has a permanent record of every email message. Feel free to use email to ask questions about projects and homework assignments. But keep in mind that, although email is available, neither the instructors or the TAs are responsible for replying to email the instant it is sent. Don't wait until the last minute before something is due to ask your questions. Also, keep in mind that, if you ask a question that has a nontrivial answer, it may not make sense for the instructor or TA to write a small book for you. Sometimes it will be reasonable for them to ask you either to bring the question to class or to come to office hours to discuss it. Although it's easy for you to dash off an email question, it takes time for the instructor or the TA to answer it. Don't ask questions to which you can find the answer somewhere else. For example, don't write to your instructor to ask where the regularly scheduled final exam is. (It's on the Registrar's web site.) Don't write and ask how much the first midterm counts. (It should be on the class syllabus.) Don't ask what happened in a class that you missed (unless you had an emergency). Office hours are there for you to use. You can expect that the person who is teaching your class loves the material and wants to share it with anyone who will listen. If you have questions about what's been covered in class or you're interested in finding out more about something, go to office hours and ask. You'll probably find that it's hard to get the faculty to shut up. The one thing that most faculty hate is students who only come to office hours to ask questions about grades. If there's been a mistake in grading your work, of course, go and ask (see below). But think twice before you go to office hours to ask questions that give the impression that you care less about learning than you do about grades. A few other points to keep in mind about office hours: If you can't make it to regularly scheduled office hours, ask for an appointment. But don't leave this to the day before the exam. It may not be possible to find a suitable time on such short notice. Again, remember the team concept. The faculty and TAs for your class will try to schedule their office hours to cover as wide a range of times as possible. If you can't make it to one person's office hours, try someone else's. Unless an office door is already open, knock first and don't go in until you're invited to do so. Grades Grades are a necessary evil. You don't like worrying about grades and the faculty hate having to assign them. We'd all rather focus on the content of our classes. But your degree is a commitment from the University that you have achieved a certain level of expertise in the classes you've taken, so we need some way to measure that. To make this process work, you need to understand: The grade you are given, either on an individual exam or assignment or as your final grade, is not the starting point of a negotiation. It is your grade unless a concrete error has been made. Do not go to see your instructor or your TA to ask for a better grade because you want one or you \"feel you deserve it\". Go only if you can document a specific error in grading or in recording your scores. Your grade is a reflection of only one thing: how well did you do in the class. Nonacademic circumstances have no bearing on your grade. Don't go to see your instructor and explain how important a better grade is in your life. It would be unfair to other students and it would undermine the meaning of the degree if the instructor responded to such issues. If you believe that an error has been made in grading your work, you have one week from the time that the work was returned to the class to file a complaint in writing to your instructor. Note that this is one week from the time that the instructor made the work available to the class. If you missed class and didn't get your work until later, there is no extension of the one week deadline. If you decide to submit a complaint about the grading of your work, make sure to describe the issue clearly and return the original work and your note to your instructor. Errors can certainly be made in grading. But keep in mind that the errors can be made either in your favor or not. So it's possible that if you ask to have a piece of work regraded your grade will go down rather than up. Remember that the most important characteristic of any grading scheme is that it be scrupulously fair to everyone in the class. Keep this in mind if you're thinking of asking, for example, for more partial credit points on a problem. The important thing is not the exact number of points that were taken off for each kind of mistake. The important thing is that that number was the same for everyone. So it can't be changed once the grading is done and the papers have been returned. You instructor will decide what it takes to get an A or a B or a C or D in the class. Deciding the boundary cases is always hard. Your instructor is under no obligation to make score cutoffs public or to tell you how far away your were from the next higher grade.",

    "text_content": "PhD Steps to Degree | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Graduate Ph.D. Program PhD Steps to Degree Steps Toward Graduation Remember to see the PhD Requirements for the rules of each step. You will need to follow these steps along the path to the PhD. In your first 3 years A \u2013 F are completed concurrently. (A) Complete the Background Coursework Requirements. (B) Before enrolling in your 2nd semester find a supervising professor and identify a research area. Initially you will not have a specific topic. You also might choose to change topics and/or faculty supervisors a few times. Please be aware that too many changes delays your degree and at some point would be considered unsatisfactory progress by the department. (C) Enroll in at least 1 conference course (CS 395) each semester until admission to candidacy. The CS 395 is supervised each semester by your research supervisor. Your first semester, CS 398T takes the place of the conference course. (D) Choose 3 depth courses in consultation with your faculty research supervisor. Choose courses designed to prepare you for the research you plan to do, at most one of theses courses can be taken outside the CS department. (E) Complete your Diversity Program, (F) Schedule a Research Preparation Exam by the end of the 3 rd year. Submit a Research Qualification (RQ) Document to the Graduate Office by the end of the 3rd year in the PhD program. Write and present your Dissertation Proposal and Advance to Candidacy. Schedule and Pass the Final Defense Submit the Dissertation to the Graduate School - you must follow the Graduate School's rules in preparing your dissertation. Throughout this process, feedback from your research supervisor and from the faculty as a whole will be very important to you. The CS Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) meets at the beginning of each semester. The GSC is composed of all the CS faculty and a few faculty from other departments who supervise research of CS PhD students. At those meetings, Research Qualification (RQ) proposals are reviewed and approved and the progress of PhD students is evaluated. Students will be informed if their performance is not satisfactory. Any student whose progress is deemed unsatisfactory for two consecutive semesters will be terminated from the PhD program.

How and when our wordmarks are used is an important part of this responsibility. Generally, TXCS constituents (students, faculty, research centers, etc.) may use a TXCS wordmark on printed pieces without prior authorization, but they may not make alterations or additions to a wordmark. Wordmarks on promotional items, such as T-shirts, caps and pens, require prior authorization by the TXCS Office of External Affairs. The TXCS wordmark should only be used for purposes, events and publications that officially relate to the department and the university. No use is permitted other than that explicitly authorized, and no release is permitted to any other third party without the expressed, written permission of the Department of Computer Science. The wordmark may not be used for the commercial profit of outside organizations or ventures. Such use could be fraudulent and may constitute grounds for prosecution. Examples of acceptable uses include external publications referring to the department in a journalistic capacity; department-related functions with corporate partners; publicity and publications of affiliated research centers; publications, banners, and memorabilia for alumni networks. External Wordmark Use External wordmark use refers to wordmarks on marketing, publicity, promotional items, advertising or items such as brochures, fliers, newsletters, letterhead, business cards, postcards, information folders, product packaging and promotional items, including T-shirts, caps, pens, stickers, decals, etc. Pre-approval is required for any such use. Send a final copy of the design to the TXCS Office of External Affairs . Please allow two to four working days for approval. Promotional Item Approval Process Promotional items such as T-shirts, caps, pens, stickers, and decals, you must obtain pre-approval from TXCS Office of External Affairs when you use: the Texas Computer Science wordmark, or text using the words \u201cDepartment of Computer Science\u201d or \"Texas Computer Science\" Approval by the Office of External Affairs is required before a purchase order will be issued.

    "text_content": "Turing Scholars Honors Program FAQ | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Turing Scholars FAQ Prospective Students Can I apply to the Turing Scholars Honors Program if I have not taken any CS classes in high school? Yes! There are many ways to demonstrate a passion for\u2014and background in\u2014computer science. Can I participate in the Turing Scholars Honors Program and also in one of the other Honors programs at UT, such as Dean's Scholars or Plan II? Yes. You are free to apply to as many Honors programs as fit your needs. We have many students who are participating in two honors programs and have even had some participate in three. Note that some honors programs will require you to double-major. Can I double major in CS and some other major if I join the Turing Scholars Honors Program? Yes. A significant fraction of our Turing Scholars choose to double major in any of a variety of subjects, including German, Chinese, Chemistry, Biology, Business, Math, Physics, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Music, and Plan II. What's the difference between Turing and CSB? CSB is a separate honors degree program for students interested in both Business and Computer Science. CSB students essentially double-major in both Business and CS. Current & Transfer Students Can I, a current UTCS student, transfer into Turing? Yes. You may apply for admission to the Turing Scholars Honors Program by submitting an online application, and then emailing a resume to the address on the online application. Applications are accepted towards the end of each semester. Successful applicants will be placed in honors courses as appropriate for their background. Can I, a transfer student, transfer into Turing? Transfer students can apply after their first semester in-residence at UT Austin. Can I, a current UTCS student, take honors classes even if I'm not in Turing? Yes. Space is limited, but the petition form for taking honors classes as a non-honors student can be found here. About the Program If I am a Turing Scholars student, must I take all of the honors classes? No. If you are admitted to the Turing Scholars Honors Program as a first year student, you will be expected to take the special sections of the first year classes. After that, you may take whatever courses you choose. However, there is a minimum number of honors classes that you must complete in order to graduate as a Turing Scholar. What kind of students do well in the Turing Scholars program? We're looking for students who are committed and hardworking, with a strong math and science background, and students who are open to challenging courses where they don\u2019t always have the answer right in front of them. What is TSSA? TSSA is the Turing Scholars Student Association, a student led organization built around the Turing Scholars program that organizes corporate, social, and research events for the Turing Scholars community. Every admitted Turing Scholar is automatically a member of this student organization. Turing Scholars Turing Scholars Why Turing?

Exceptional incoming computer scientists in our graduate program are candidates for the prestigious new Provost\u2019s Graduate Excellence Fellowship or the Calhoun Graduate Excellence Fellowship. The University of Texas at Austin is working to identify talented and exemplary graduate students to receive four years of fellowship support. The goal is to help selected students excel in their vital role of advancing research, mentoring undergraduates, and fostering discovery alongside our top-tier faculty. The Department of Computer Science is pleased to be able to offer a limited number of candidates of the highest promise these competitive multi-year fellowships. Students with outstanding academic records and those who have established a track record of success as researchers and innovators will be automatically considered for these elite awards. Provost\u2019s or Calhoun Graduate Excellence Fellowship support includes a 9-month stipend of $24,300.* In addition, fellows receive up to $4,000 over four years in research and travel support, a waiver of tuition and fees, and University medical benefits. The total compensation package is valued at over $153,000 per recipient. * For two of the four years, fellows receive these stipends as standalone support. The remaining two years tie stipends to work as a teaching assistant or a graduate research assistant in a faculty member\u2019s lab. Students are asked to teach for either one or two years only, as this amount of time instructing others is considered optimal for our graduate students' professional development. Research Assistantships Some students enter our program with research assistantships; however, research assistantships normally are appointed on a semester basis. These are under the purview of the individual professors and are generally made after the student has been enrolled for at least 1-2 semesters. A GRA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester, and covers the student's tuition, fees and insurance. Most students find a research supervisor during the second or third year and may be supported as research assistants. Teaching Assistantships Teaching assistantships are available for doctoral students. Appointments to teaching assistantships are on a semester basis. Each semester, students in the department may submit their application to be a teaching assistant. In addition, offers of teaching assistantships are often made at the time of admission by the admissions committee. New International TAs must satisfy an oral English Assessment conducted by the University. The Test of Spoken English does not substitute for this assessment. A TA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester, and covers the student's tuition, fees and insurance. Other Funding Information and assistance in searching for external fellowships/grants for which graduate students may apply can be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies: gradschool.utexas.edu/finances/fellowships/externally-funded Tuition and Fees The amount that each student must pay for tuition and fees depends on 2 criteria: The number of hours for which the student is enrolled. Typically CS graduate students take nine hours, but, in rare cases, they may petition for approval to enroll in twelve. The student's residency status. Texas residents pay lower rates than do students who are international or out of state. Those students who have certain graduate fellowships, TA positions, or RA positions are entitled to pay the Texas resident tuition rate.

    "text_content": "Thesis Option | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Home Graduate Master's Program Thesis Option The list of courses required to obtain a degree is called the program of work. A total of 30 hours of coursework within 3 areas is needed to complete the program of work for the Master\u2019s Thesis option. The Graduate Advisor approves the program of work prior to graduation. This checklist is available for planning and evaluating your program of work. Please see Course Information for current and future semester CS teaching plans. The information below is organized into five sections. Section 1 discusses background requirements. Section 2 discusses major coursework requirements. Section 3 discusses minor coursework requirements. Section 4 discusses additional requirements. Section 5 discusses transfer work. 1 - BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (not a prerequisite, can be met after admission) We acknowledge that other departments/universities divide up their curricula in different ways. The important thing is that approximately the same material has been covered. The decision about which courses you submit for review meet the background requirements is made by the faculty. The form is submitted to the grad office. The following UTCS undergraduate courses, or equivalent, are required as background*: Discrete Math for Computer Science (CS 311) Introduction to Programming (CS 312) Data Structures (CS 314) Algorithms and Complexity (CS 331) Computer Organization and Architecture (CS 429) Principles of Computer Systems (CS 439) Rules Any background requirements not met at the time of admission must be satisfied while enrolled in the Masters program. A common question is whether an undergraduate background requirement can be satisfied by taking the corresponding graduate course. Generally speaking, the corresponding graduate course assumes the undergraduate material as background, and so this approach is not permitted. That said, exceptions to this general rule are sometimes granted. A student seeking an exception should consult with the faculty member teaching the corresponding graduate course. One upper-division background course taken at UTCS as a graduate student may count towards your CS Major coursework. (At most 3 hours of undergraduate coursework can count towards your program of work.) How to Complete Background Requirements Complete an undergraduate degree with a major in Computer Science prior to joining our graduate program; OR Coursework that covers the background topics through any combination of: Courses taken prior to admission. Background courses named above may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class. Student receives a B or better on Final exam(s) of UTCS undergraduate background courses. *Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements. Please see the pre-2016 background coursework form and checklist for a list of previous background coursework. 2 \u2013 MAJOR COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS (CS COURSES) 24 hours of major coursework \u2013 Please pay attention to the Credit/No Credit CR/NC rules written in #2 below. 9 hrs. of diversity courses, 9 hrs. of CS Graduate courses, 6 hours of thesis. Rules 9 hours of diversity courses - 1 course from each of the 3 areas - applications, systems, and theory. Passed with a grade of B- or better. 9 hours of any 3 CS graduate courses passed with a grade of C or better. One undergraduate upper division course may be substituted for 1 graduate course; however, no 'elements' courses may be used as a substitute. The undergraduate course may be taken either for a grade or CR/NC. Please remember background courses have a grade requirement so are not usually taken CR/NC. At most 3 hours of undergraduate coursework can count towards your program of work. It is possible to receive credit towards the MS degree for taking a CS 395 conference course (i.e., supervised research). However, students wishing to explore this possibility should bear in mind the following considerations. First, CS 395 is graded on a CR/NC basis, and at most one CR/NC course can be used towards the MS degree. (Exception: The MS thesis sequence CS 698A/B is graded on a CR/NC basis, and does not count against the one CR/NC course limit.) Second, a grade of CR is necessary but not sufficient to receive credit towards the MS degree. After assigning a grade of CR in the course, if the supervising professor feels that the student's work is strong enough to merit MS degree credit, they should send a statement to this effect to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu . The statement should include a brief summary of the student's accomplishments in the CS 395. 2 CS Thesis courses - CS 698A and CS 698B are offered only for CR/NC. These courses are taken in separate semesters. Be sure to enroll in CS 698B the semester you plan to graduate. You may enroll in CS 698B more than once though it only counts one time on your program of work. How To Select Courses and Register The CS graduate department does not advise each semester, although you can visit the graduate office at any time with questions. You can seek information on classes from your peers, looking at course evaluation information and by going to course information . You can also attend the first day of classes and speak with the instructor. Personal registration dates and times can be accessed by going to your Registration Information Sheet (RIS). 3 \u2013 MINOR COURSEWORK REQUIREMENTS 6 hours (2 courses) in a minor: a supporting subject or subjects outside of computer science. Rules One minor course may be taken CR/NC. (At most 3 hours of CR/NC coursework can count towards your program of work, excluding thesis work.) One minor course may be an undergraduate upper division (At most 3 hours of undergraduate coursework can count towards your program of work.) Graduate Adviser approval required. This must be obtained no later then the first 12 class days in Spring or Fall sessions and the 4th class day in Summer session. How To Obtain Approval and Register Email the graduate advisor directly explaining the importance of the course with a cc: to gradoffice@cs.utexas.edu for minor course approval. Minor courses only count on your program of work with approval from the graduate adviser. Personal registration dates and times can be accessed by going to your Registration Information Sheet (RIS). 4 - ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS In addition to the requirements mentioned above, there are rules imposed by both the CS department and the Graduate School. These rules are about things like grades, courses taken in residence, transfer credit, and time limits. Every student should read these rules soon after being admitted to the Masters program and make sure to satisfy them. The Graduate School specifies degree requirements in the Graduate Catalog that apply to courses counted toward a graduate degree. Read that information and make sure that you satisfy each item. We summarize below the graduate school and department requirements that most often affect CS students. A maximum of 3 hours of undergraduate classes may be counted for a 30 hr. masters degree. A minimum grade point average of 3.0 overall is required. All degree requirements must be completed within a 6 year period. Diversity requirement: 9 hours of diversity courses, one from each diversity area. Major requirement: additional CS courses as required for each degree. No more than 3 hours of courses may be taken on a CR/NC basis (excludes thesis coursework). To receive a Masters degree, a student must have been in residence at UT-Austin for two full semesters or equivalent. Courses in which a student earned a C- and lower or NC may not be counted on the program of work. 5 - TRANSFER WORK Rules The following rules apply to courses transferred from another institution: Only courses taken at major institutions within the United States may be transferred. CS Graduate Adviser and the Graduate school must approve the institution and course(s). Only graduate courses may be transferred. Courses designed for both graduates and undergraduates are generally not eligible for transfer credit. Only courses in which a grade of A or B was earned may be transferred. A maximum of two courses (6 hours) may be transferred. No course that counted toward a previous degree may be transferred. No transferred course may be used to satisfy a diversity requirement. To apply for transfer credit, a student must submit: A petition to the Graduate Advisor. The petition will also have to be signed by the Dean of the Graduate School. An official transcript that shows the course that is to be transferred. An official explanation of the course numbering system that is used at the institution at which the course was taken. A copy of the course description taken from the institution's catalog or web site.

Dijkstra Graduate Student Support Fund Make a Gift Graduate students are essential to the UT Computer Science\u2019s mission to lead in the creation of scientific knowledge and practical technologies that are defining the digital revolution of the 21st century. Professor Dijkstra understood this and his research and teachings have had a lasting impact on Texas Computer Science and a number of our alumni who have continued his pioneering contributions to the field by advancing their own in programming, logic, verification, and formal methods to name but a few. A gift to the Edsger Dijkstra graduate fellowship fund honors the legacy of one of the most significant figures in computer science while supporting and helping to recruit talented graduate students in computer science. About Professor Dijkstra Dijkstra was born in 1930 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, the son of a chemist father and a mathematician mother. He graduated from the Gymnasium Erasmianum in Rotterdam and obtained degrees in mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Leyden and a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Amsterdam. He worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, 1952-62; was professor of mathematics, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1962-1984; and was the Burroughs Corporation research fellow, 1973-1984. He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computing Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, 1984-1999, and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1999. Dijkstra was the 1972 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, often viewed as the Nobel Prize for computing. He was a member of the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. He received the 1974 AFIPS Harry Goode Award, the 1982 IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, and the 1989 ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. Throughout his scientific career, Dijkstra formulated and pursued the highest academic ideals of scientific rigor untainted by commercial, managerial, or political considerations. Simplicity, beauty, and eloquence were his hallmarks, and his uncompromising insistence on elegance in programming and mathematics was an inspiration to thousands. He judged his own work by the highest standards and set a continuing challenge to his many friends to do the same. For the rest, he willingly undertook the role of Socrates, that of a gadfly to society, repeatedly goading his native and his adoptive country by remarking on the mistakes inherent in fashionable ideas and the dangers of time-serving compromises. Like Socrates, his most significant legacy is to those who engaged with him in small group discussions or scientific correspondence about half-formulated ideas and emerging discoveries. Although Professor Dijkstra passed away in 2002 through cancer, future students should know that this renowned computer scientist once taught at this department. The \u2018 Dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra Graduate Student Support Fund \u2019 is a fitting tribute to the impact he had here at UT and in the world of Computer Science. Donate Now",

The students are looking forward to starting their undergraduate journeys as TXCS students in the fall. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about how challenging it will be,\u201d says Li. \u201cI want to see how far I can push myself within these next four years.\u201d Li\u2019s love for computer science stems from a project she did with a friend in the tenth grade, where they recreated Dance Dance Revolution. \u201cThe reward that I felt after the project was finished and other people got to play it and [I saw] how much they enjoyed our game\u2026 that really settled it for me that computer science was something that I wanted to do,\u201d she says. In Nickerson\u2019s case, her passion for the subject started when she noticed how few girls were in her computer science classes in high school. Deciding to do something about it, she applied for funding from The National Center for Women & Information Technology to teach elementary school girls about programming and technology, and created a weeklong camp called Code Chicks. \u201cHopefully more girls will be in those computer science classes at my high school further down the road so it won\u2019t feel so lonely!\u201d she says. Nickerson also already has some familiarity with the TXCS department from having attended the First Bytes summer camp. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to see the Gates Dell Complex and how amazing it is, as well as all the great faculty there, and the research opportunities,\u201d she says. Within TXCS, the students are excited to explore the array of opportunities that they are exposed to. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do a hackathon,\u201d laughs Li. \u201cThe thought of staying up all night with your friends, trying to solve a problem\u2026 I think it sounds really fun.\u201d Among other things that they want to be involved in are the Longhorn Startup Lab and Code Orange. This is a difficult time to be facing new beginnings, and the incoming class is definitely encountering some uncertainty about what their first semester will entail. Despite the confusion, these students are trying to look on the bright side. \u201cI wish it didn't happen during my senior year because I'll miss all of the high school traditions, but I'm trying to stay positive,\u201d says Nickerson. She adds, \u201cI'm disappointed that I will miss that classic, on-campus orientation experience, but I'm still really excited for college.\u201d Li seconds this feeling. \u201cEven if classes are online, I still have full faith that I will be able to learn and that I\u2019ll be just as excited about my subjects as if I were at UT,\u201d she says. \u201cI just have the mindset of \u2018things will work out in the end\u2019. And I might take a really long path to get there, but there\u2019s a lot of learning and growing to do no matter what happens, so I\u2019m happy either way.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Undergraduate Students",

    "text_content": "Professor Chand John Works Toward A More Inclusive Computer Science Education | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor Chand John Works Toward A More Inclusive Computer Science Education Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, July 15, 2021 Dr. Chand John graduated from UT as a math and computer science dual major in 2003 and then went on to earn his CS master\u2019s and PhD from Stanford. He noticed that CS textbooks are often \u201cgrey\u201d and not visually appealing, so he decided to try his hand at CS art. Now, Dr. John creates computer science-based comics and is the creator of an animated lesson on sorting that has amassed over 3 million views on YouTube. The lesson was later adapted by BBC News Brasil , which cited him in a video on algorithms, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic bias. He creates comics on CS topics in a \u201cpanel style\u201d that allows him to tell a story, rather than just list out facts and figures. \u201cFor many years, I've been trying to figure out ways to use art and other means to make computer science more accessible. I think my biggest beef is with textbooks because they cover the material, but it's so hard to sit down and read them. And sometimes you get lost trying to follow them,\u201d Dr. John said. His comics feature famous women in STEM such as Katherine Johnson and Ada Lovelace, topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and colorful renditions of technical concepts. Dr. John's rendition of Katherine Johnson, celebrating her contributions to STEM and space exploration. He recognizes that there are biases in the field of computing that limit minorities from succeeding and proudly works to end these biases and advocates for underrepresented groups here at The University of Texas at Austin. Dr. John pushes for diversity, equity and inclusion both on and off-campus by using his skill as a scientific communicator to feature underrepresented groups in vibrant ways and as an educator and mentor. He currently serves as the faculty advisor of the Association of Black Computer Scientists (ABCS) , leads and advises some of the diversity initiatives within UTCS, and has served on UT\u2019s Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Faculty Advisory Committee. Dr. John has also created and presented a research-backed talk on unconscious bias to local tech companies, including NXP Semiconductors, as an advisor to Breaking the Glass, an organization focused on improving diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. Dr. John won Breaking the Glass's Community Champions Award in 2019. He received the Clock Award for supporting students with disabilities in 2019 as well. He recalls not hearing much about these necessary conversations when he was earning his degrees at UT. \u201cWhen I was a student, there was a fairly traditional environment. The number I know for computer science, specifically, is that we went from about 10% female to about 25% female, which is still nowhere close to parity. But it's a big improvement for the department, especially a department of this size with a really high reputation. There's a lot more widespread acknowledgement that this should be done. We should work on improving diversity, equity, justice, and inclusion.\u201d Through his own efforts, he recognizes that there is still much-needed work to be done to achieve stronger, more tangible equity within computer science and academia. \u201cThere's a lot of talking about it, which is good \u2013 a lot of dialogue needs to happen to make some of the change, but what I\u2019ve found is that there's still a disparity in what the student experience is thought of being, and how many people know what that experience is actually like, especially for women, anyone who's a minority, and people with disabilities.\u201d Excerpt from Dr. John's comic book \"for all of us, especially girls and women, to learn and enjoy computer science.\" Dr. John feels that a lot of current textbooks and curriculums are forcing people into a narrow idea of what computer science should look like. His goal is to break that apart. \u201cThe CS class that I teach (CS312: Intro to Programming) is kind of a high-stakes, high-pressure, intro to programming class,\u201d Dr. John said, adding that he doesn\u2019t want to perpetuate stereotypes especially in a class that can either ignite or burn out someone\u2019s interest in CS. The textbooks and materials traditionally used in such classes feature pictures and quotes from primarily white, male computer science figures. So he started doing research on female computer scientists and STEM leaders to start bringing quotes in from them onto course materials, presentations, and lectures. \u201cI haven't lived the experience of being a woman in computer science, or a Black student in computer science, or a Native American in computer science, so I wanted to focus more on that. So when I came back to teaching at UT, that was something that I was especially interested in: Can we actually change the way that we're teaching to change the way computer science is presented?\u201d He keeps these questions in mind as he navigates academia and the field of technology. Dr. John chats with an academy attendee in 2019. As a working parent, he recognizes the struggles that students, faculty, and staff are facing at the moment and works to create a welcoming environment through it all. On teaching during a pandemic, Dr. John said that the transition to remote learning has \u201cbeen a little rocky, but people have been very understanding.\u201d Despite the ongoing challenges, Dr. John\u2019s mission of creating a more inclusive field of CS continues, as he carries on with his efforts to advocate for and amplify underrepresented voices both online and offline.

    "text_content": "How Soft Capacity Methods and Parallel Deterministic Routability Are Improving Academic Chip Design | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How Soft Capacity Methods and Parallel Deterministic Routability Are Improving Academic Chip Design Posted by Lauren Cotton on Tuesday, May 24, 2022 As chips become larger and more complex, their routing algorithms must also be improved and optimized to face the challenge. Recent UT Computer Science PhD graduate Michael Jiayuan He \u2019s research in computer chip design has made a notable step forward towards more efficient and successful chip design in the academic arena. In \u201c SPRoute 2.0: A detailed-routability-driven deterministic parallel global router with soft capacity ,\u201d he explores solutions at the Global Routing level that make the process of detailed routing more efficient. These methods allow the computer scientist to proactively avoid shorts and create successful designs earlier along in the process, optimizing the routing phase overall. In the industry-standard method of chip design (VSLI), there are two phases of routing: Global Routing and Detailed Routing. Global routing collapses the 3D chip into a 2D simplified grid. A way to conceptualize this phase is by thinking of it as choosing a highway to drive down during busy rush hour traffic. You simplify the roads available to a list then choose a sequence of highways that get you to your destination and are the least congested. The wires are similarly routed into available regions (highways) on the chip which gives a suggested routing configuration for the detailed routing phase to refine. If we follow the same analogy of rush hour traffic, the detailed routing phase would be like picking a lane on a busy highway. In the case of a wire\u2019s path, only one \u201ccar\u201d can fit in each of the available \u201clanes\u201d. Global routing picks the path, detailed routing picks the specific lane. To understand the novelty of He\u2019s method, it must first be understood that traditional global routing looks at each edge of the grid as the total set of available tracks to route wires through in that region. Typically, it will fill these areas to their full capacity which gives the detailed routing algorithms less flexibility to fix other issues that may arise when refining the design. This is where the soft capacity solution is crucial. Soft capacity is a specific solution that attacks the problem of certain spaces in the chip being overcrowded and congested. Through running a test of the pin density (density of inputs within a section of the chip) and the RUDY (rectangular uniform wire density) which describes the average wire length per unit area in a certain bounding box of the network (the network or \u201cnet\u201d is a set of wire connections) the computer scientist is able to predict where there will be congestion and possible shorts. The graphic below shows an example of the result a test like this yields: Image The more densely red areas are the areas that are more congested with wire connections. It is clear to see here that there is a section that is specifically darker than the rest, and therefore more likely to be overloaded and short. The soft capacity method redistributes this density by allowing less wires to be routed through that specific area. For example, if the wire capacity was 15, soft capacity would call for decreasing that number to 5 or 10 in order for the wires to be rerouted to other places on the chip and spread out the overall density. Additionally, there is the element of improving parallelization maze routing methods to create a more efficient deterministic result. Parallelization, a technique which breaks down a complicated process into pieces that can be executed simultaneously, can actually make things less efficient if left to automatic route through pathways in this context. This is because it can create LiveLock situations like the one shown below. Image The graphic above shows how when the task of avoiding overloading of a path is parallelized, both wires move out of the way, recreating the original problem in a repeating loop. This is similar to when you and someone approaching you on the sidewalk both move in the same direction at the same time. If you keep moving out of each other\u2019s way at the same time, you\u2019ll always be in the way and neither of you has a free path. In these social scenarios, the solution is to wait and let the other person move before moving out of the way yourself. This logic is the same for wire routing. By executing the parallelized tasks in batches using an automated scheduler, the wires must essentially wait for the previous batch to make a decision and then react to that before making a routing decision itself. These batches are groups of wires across different areas of the chip that don\u2019t normally interact with each other, and therefore retain the increased efficiency that comes from parallelization while also avoiding its pitfalls. These solutions presented in He\u2019s research not only logically make sense as ways to increase efficiency, but the SPRoute 2.0 methodology also shows impressive experimental results. SPRoute 2.0 produces 43% fewer shorts, 14% fewer Design Rule Checks (DRCs), and a 7.4x speedup over a state of the art global router on the ICCAD2019 contest benchmarks for which this research was prepared.

    "text_content": "Brain Activity Decoder Can Reveal Stories in People\u2019s Minds | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Brain Activity Decoder Can Reveal Stories in People\u2019s Minds Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, May 1, 2023 Alex Huth (left), Shailee Jain (center) and Jerry Tang (right) prepare to collect brain activity data in the Biomedical Imaging Center at The University of Texas at Austin. The researchers trained their semantic decoder on dozens of hours of brain activity data from participants, collected in an fMRI scanner. Photo Credit: Nolan Zunk/University of Texas at Austin. The work relies in part on a transformer model, similar to the ones that power ChatGPT A new artificial intelligence system called a semantic decoder can translate a person\u2019s brain activity \u2014 while listening to a story or silently imagining telling a story \u2014 into a continuous stream of text. The system developed by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin might help people who are mentally conscious yet unable to physically speak, such as those debilitated by strokes, to communicate intelligibly again. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , was led by Jerry Tang, a doctoral student in computer science, and Alex Huth, an assistant professor of neuroscience and computer science at UT Austin. The work relies in part on a transformer model, similar to the ones that power Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard. Unlike other language decoding systems in development, this system does not require subjects to have surgical implants, making the process noninvasive. Participants also do not need to use only words from a prescribed list. Brain activity is measured using an fMRI scanner after extensive training of the decoder, in which the individual listens to hours of podcasts in the scanner. Later, provided that the participant is open to having their thoughts decoded, their listening to a new story or imagining telling a story allows the machine to generate corresponding text from brain activity alone. \u201cFor a noninvasive method, this is a real leap forward compared to what\u2019s been done before, which is typically single words or short sentences,\u201d Huth said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the model to decode continuous language for extended periods of time with complicated ideas.\u201d The result is not a word-for-word transcript. Instead, researchers designed it to capture the gist of what is being said or thought, albeit imperfectly. About half the time, when the decoder has been trained to monitor a participant\u2019s brain activity, the machine produces text that closely (and sometimes precisely) matches the intended meanings of the original words. For example, in experiments, a participant listening to a speaker say, \u201cI don\u2019t have my driver\u2019s license yet\u201d had their thoughts translated as, \u201cShe has not even started to learn to drive yet.\u201d Listening to the words, \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to scream, cry or run away. Instead, I said, \u2018Leave me alone!\u2019\u201d was decoded as, \u201cStarted to scream and cry, and then she just said, \u2018I told you to leave me alone.\u2019\u201d Image This image shows decoder predictions from brain recordings collected while a user listened to four stories. Example segments were manually selected and annotated to demonstrate typical decoder behaviors. The decoder exactly reproduces some words and phrases and captures the gist of many more. Credit - University of Texas at Austin. Beginning with an earlier version of the paper that appeared as a preprint online, the researchers addressed questions about potential misuse of the technology. The paper describes how decoding worked only with cooperative participants who had participated willingly in training the decoder. Results for individuals on whom the decoder had not been trained were unintelligible, and if participants on whom the decoder had been trained later put up resistance \u2014 for example, by thinking other thoughts \u2014 results were similarly unusable. \u201cWe take very seriously the concerns that it could be used for bad purposes and have worked to avoid that,\u201d Tang said. \u201cWe want to make sure people only use these types of technologies when they want to and that it helps them.\u201d In addition to having participants listen or think about stories, the researchers asked subjects to watch four short, silent videos while in the scanner. The semantic decoder was able to use their brain activity to accurately describe certain events from the videos. The system currently is not practical for use outside of the laboratory because of its reliance on the time need on an fMRI machine. But the researchers think this work could transfer to other, more portable brain-imaging systems, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). \u201cfNIRS measures where there\u2019s more or less blood flow in the brain at different points in time, which, it turns out, is exactly the same kind of signal that fMRI is measuring,\u201d Huth said. \u201cSo, our exact kind of approach should translate to fNIRS,\u201d although, he noted, the resolution with fNIRS would be lower. This work was supported by the Whitehall Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. The study\u2019s other co-authors are Amanda LeBel, a former research assistant in the Huth lab, and Shailee Jain, a computer science graduate student at UT Austin. Alexander Huth and Jerry Tang have filed a PCT patent application related to this work.

Frequently Asked Questions Could this technology be used on someone without them knowing, say by an authoritarian regime interrogating political prisoners or an employer spying on employees? No. The system has to be extensively trained on a willing subject in a facility with large, expensive equipment. \u201cA person needs to spend up to 15 hours lying in an MRI scanner, being perfectly still, and paying good attention to stories that they\u2019re listening to before this really works well on them,\u201d said Huth. Could training be skipped altogether? No. The researchers tested the system on people whom it hadn\u2019t been trained on and found that the results were unintelligible. Are there ways someone can defend against having their thoughts decoded? Yes. The researchers tested whether a person who had previously participated in training could actively resist subsequent attempts at brain decoding. Tactics like thinking of animals or quietly imagining telling their own story let participants easily and completely thwart the system from recovering the speech the person was exposed to. What if technology and related research evolved to one day overcome these obstacles or defenses? \u201cI think right now, while the technology is in such an early state, it\u2019s important to be proactive by enacting policies that protect people and their privacy,\u201d Tang said. \u201cRegulating what these devices can be used for is also very important.\u201d Image Alex Huth (left), discusses the semantic decoder project with Jerry Tang (center) and Shailee Jain (right) in the biomedical imaging center at The University of Texas at Austin.

    "text_content": "How Block Encodings are Optimizing Phase Estimation | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How Block Encodings are Optimizing Phase Estimation Posted by Lauren Cotton on Thursday, February 10, 2022 In his recent paper, \u201cFaster Coherent Quantum Algorithms for Faster Phase, Energy, and Amplitude Estimation\u201d, UTCS PhD graduate Patrick Rall puts forth novel quantum algorithms for estimating important fundamental qualities of our complex world. Patrick\u2019s approach simplifies the necessary computations compared to the current standard method. Estimation of these properties has applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry as well as machine learning and finance. In quantum mechanics, the task of measuring observed qualities like energy, charge, and conductivity can be a complicated task due to quantum randomness. When looking at the world through a mathematical lens, everything you observe is encoded into a big and complicated matrix, and the actual value is the solution to an equation involving this matrix. Fortunately, quantum computers are very good at solving this equation. However, there is a key restriction on the type of matrix that is easy to solve this way. Patrick\u2019s research hones in on the requirement for a matrix to be unitary. The matrix used to generate energy values, the Hamiltonian, is famously non-unitary and complicates this calculation. Without a new algorithm to simplify this scenario, scientists were forced to use traditional methods. These methods are cumbersome due to the fact that the Hamiltonian simulates the passage of time (which is unitary) from which then energy is found through the extra step of Fourier analysis.  Patrick broke free of this restriction and utilized block encoding to, according to him, \u201clet quantum computers talk about whatever matrices we want by working with the Hamiltonian directly.\u201d So, how can quantum computers manipulate non-unitary matrices? Basically, the computer translates the matrix that wasn't originally unitary into a larger unitary matrix. This is the overarching logic that we bring to the specific non-unitary matrix we are trying to solve: the Hamiltonian. Patrick leverages a standard method developed by Andrew Childs, Robin Kothari, and their co-authors that constructs a unitary matrix with the Hamiltonian in the top left corner. Image Once we have loaded the Hamiltonian onto the quantum computer, we have all the information we need to find the energy. This is the job of Patrick\u2019s method. First, the algorithm writes the energy as a series of bits (0s and 1s) using a binary expansion. Then, for each bit, it applies a polynomial to the Hamiltonian that calculates that bit as a function of the energy (see figure). The result is an observable that indicates just that bit of the energy. Finally, it measures the observable for each bit, and puts them back together into a numerical value for the energy. This is represented by this figure: Image MSB stands for Most Significant Bit and LSB stands for Least Significant Bit. Each horizontal layer represents the value of a bit in the binary expansion of the energy. The horizontal layer at the bottom of the graph represents the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and the highest layer represents the Least Significant Bit (LSB). The polynomials that indicate the bits need to jump up and down at different speeds. This provides a way to estimate energies expressed by the Hamiltonian in a way that is about 20 times more efficient than previous methods.

    "text_content": "How Life Experiences Pushed UTCS Alum Natalie Berestovsky to Pursue Her Passion in Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How Life Experiences Pushed UTCS Alum Natalie Berestovsky to Pursue Her Passion in Computer Science Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Thursday, August 19, 2021 UT Computer Science alum Natalie Berestovsky struggled to speak English at the level of her peers as a sophomore in high school when she first migrated to Texas from Moscow. Coincidently, this hardship is what pushed her to begin her journey in computer science. The high school she went to offered computer science classes to its students which gave Natalie more confidence as they evened the language playing field between her and her classmates. Suddenly they were all learning a new language, Java, and no student was more proficient than the others. With this confidence she gained from computer science, Natalie decided to further her studies in the field. Like most Texans, she sought to stay in-state for college, and chose to further her studies at UT Computer Science . Image Natalie joined the Texas Rowing NCAA Team her sophomore year as a way to find female friends. Early on as a student, Natalie had a hard time fitting in as a female in a male dominated field, almost deciding to completely change her major to engineering in hopes the field would have more women representation. She joined the Texas Rowing NCAA Team her sophomore year as a way to find female friends, since there weren't that many in the computer science department. After applying for a Google scholarship , where she earned a spot as a finalist, Natalie also earned a spot on a trip to the Grace Hopper Celebration , an event that brings together women in tech. This was her first time seeing a lot of successful women within the field she wanted to pursue. \u201cWhen I saw all these women being in computer science and being passionate despite social pressures of what a computer scientist should look like,\u201d Natalie says, \u201cit encouraged me to stay [in computer science].\u201d The confidence that Natalie acquired in this event as a young computer scientist inspired her to participate in organizing a trip for young women in computer science to Grace Hopper later as an upperclassman at UTCS. While at UT, Natalie was also approached by Dr. Burger , her professor for a Computer Micro-Architecture course, to do undergraduate research. This research was published, allowing her to attend a conference in New York City, gaining a taste of academia and graduate school along the way. Additionally during her time at UT, Natalie was also able to gain professional experience by attaining multiple internship positions for ExxonMobil . The programs and resources that were available to Natalie at UT gave her the necessary experiences to be well-positioned to choose which field she wanted to pursue further in her career. Natalie started graduate school in Texas with the initial goal of furthering her studies in computational architecture. However, she was later inspired by her advisor, Luay K. Nakhleh , to change her major to a field she called the early days of data science: bioinformatics. Natalie currently works in Houston as the lead of the AI team for Bill.com , a company that provides a complete back office solution for small to mid-sized businesses nationwide. At the time that she was a student, AI and data science was not something that was taught; however the strong base in software engineering that she acquired from being a college student allowed her to be able to acquire new skills and adapt into this new field. Computer science has diversified more since Natalie graduated, however similar barriers still exist for people with a similar background as her. For Natalie, her journey in computer science has taught her that success comes when you embrace your passion. \u201cUntil I went to Grace Hopper [Celebration] and embraced my inner nerd, it was tough,\u201d she says, \u201cbut once I did that's when I felt very free and pursued things that I\u2019m good at.\u201d \u200b\u200b Image UTCS attendees at Grace Hopper '19 In October, forty UTCS students will join the thousands of female scientists, engineers, and researchers gathered at Grace Hopper Celebration '21 .

    "text_content": "All That Jazz: Improving Automated Piano Note Transcription | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content All That Jazz: Improving Automated Piano Note Transcription Posted by Lauren Cotton on Wednesday, November 17, 2021 Any fan of jazz music can attest to the beauty of musical improvisation. However, many famous improvisational piano pieces aren't recorded in sheet music. \u201cThere's a lot of music that exists in the world that doesn't have musical transcriptions because it was played improvisationally\u2014virtuosos that never decided to write anything down,\u201d explained Varun Rajaram. This is because transcribing the notes of a piece (especially polyphonic pieces where multiple notes play at a time) is a difficult task even for skilled musicians. When exploring this topic, Varun realized there was a considerable error factor in the current transcription software when attempting to transcribe jazz music. As a piano player himself, Varun was aware that the current note transcription database Maestro only contained classical music and was much less successful when attempting to accurately transcribe other genres. This inspired him to investigate this topic for his Turing Scholars Honors Thesis . Overseen by UT Computer Science Professor David Harwath and UT Music Professor John Mills , he began investigating the best method to improve this database. Varun\u2019s interdisciplinary research concluded that broadening this database to include jazz pieces would be an achievable way to make a lasting impact on the music industry\u2019s ability to efficiently auto-transcribe pieces. The first phase of bettering this process of music transcription began by collecting a significant corpus of data from the Jazz genre. Professor John Mills helped provide this data, later named the MILLS dataset. Another jazz dataset was created as well from the music of Doug McKenzie called the DMJ dataset. These datasets consisted of the audio recordings of pieces as well as the underlying MIDI recording (MIDI contains an encoded record of pitch and duration of the audio but doesn't show notes played). For those familiar with Garageband on Apple products you may recognize MIDI represented as a piano roll. Image Piano roll representation of the song All of Me by Frank Sinatra. The 88 piano keys are represented on the vertical axis and each colored bar represents a note being held for a particular duration at the corresponding pitch. With the help of Professor David Harwath the next step was creating a machine learning algorithm that was taught using jazz pieces and running this model for comparison against the previous classically trained model. The results were successful, and these datasets are now publicly available to assist others in this goal. Through this broadening of the available transcription datasets, musicians are now one step closer to precise note recording. The industry applications of this research are far-reaching, including creative applications such as computer-generated music and easier analysis of infamous pieces. Varun reflected on his research experience of writing an honors thesis and expressed his gratitude for both the opportunity and the dedication of his mentors. He explained how Professor Harwath, \u201cwas willing to get his hands dirty and help me a lot, and be more involved than the average advisor advising a CS thesis would be.\u201d The Turing Scholars Honors Program is UTCS\u2019s honors program for gifted computer science students that encourages these students to expand their skills through a cohort environment and the opportunity to write an honors thesis. Varun is now a Digital Analyst with McKinsey and Company where he continues to pursue interdisciplinary solutions to complex problems.

In a new perspectives piece published in the Journal of Applied Physics , a multidisciplinary team including physicist Demkov, computer scientist Chandrajit Bajaj and chemical engineer John Ekerdt lay out a vision for a practical neuromorphic computer that integrates traditional computer chips that use electrons to store and process information with devices that use light to do similar functions. They identified a key component that will need to be developed to make this a reality: an electro-optical modulator, a device that can encode information in light and perform certain kinds of computations. The team is designing, building and testing electro-optical modulators made of barium titanate. This material can produce more compact, energy-efficient devices than other popular materials that have been investigated for modulators. Another advantage of this material is that the modulators can be fabricated directly on silicon chips using conventional manufacturing processes, which means they could be affordably integrated into existing production facilities. Demkov said the team's biggest strength is the broad range of skills and experiences each member brings from their vantage points across the College of Natural Sciences, Cockrell School of Engineering, Texas Materials Institute and Oden Institute. As a physicist, Demkov uses atomic-scale computer models to develop designs for devices that utilize the unique properties of materials. Chad Landis , professor in the Cockrell School and Oden Institute, models larger scale processes, on the order of hundreds of thousands of atoms. Dan Wasserman , professor in the Cockrell School, builds the devices. Bajaj, professor in the College of Natural Sciences and the Oden Institute, identifies applications for the devices. Other UT Austin contributors to the effort include Jamie Warner, Ray Chen, Seth Bank, Edward Yu and Sanjay Banerjee. \"The multidisciplinary aspect of this collaboration makes it very exciting because we each bring completely different perspectives,\" Demkov said.

    "text_content": "Mission Accomplished | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Mission Accomplished Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, November 5, 2020 UT Austin is committed to working with the U.S. military to identify and prioritize research that can quickly be adapted to help protect and defend the nation\u2019s interest. A methodical voice tells the watching crowd, \u201cI am going to remove the lid.\u201d Everyone is quiet as a robot using artificial intelligence (AI) opens a trash can and lifts out a bag. Students and researchers hold their breath as it navigates across the floor of a mock house, avoiding obstacles to its destination. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d it says. The trash has been taken out and the audience applauds. This is a huge achievement for the robot designed by a Texas Robotics team for the 2019 RoboCup competition. It may seem like a lot of fanfare for a basic chore, but it is a complicated task for a machine. The robot demonstrated autonomy and communication skills in a changing environment, key interests for artificial intelligence experts right now and the U.S. military. Related research could help future service robots go beyond taking out the trash to assisting and performing dangerous tasks \u2014 keeping soldiers out of harm\u2019s way. That is why The University of Texas at Austin is proudly partnering with the Army Futures Command , a new four-star command that is transforming Army modernization. Together, they are putting useful research into practice on the battlefield more quickly. The partnership is a commitment to identify and further early research and development that has the ability to transition rapidly, getting new technology quickly to the hands of those who need it. \u201cThe challenges are huge,\u201d says Justin Hart , assistant director of Texas Robotics and an assistant professor of practice with the Department of Computer Science involved in research with the Army Futures Command. Hart is an expert on semantic mapping, autonomous human-robot interaction, and artificial intelligence for service robots. Multi-tasking autonomous AI robots are the holy grail of his field. \u201cWe are doing fundamental research that has the ability to be applied to solve problems. We want to ensure there is a pipeline that makes that research available in a usable format.\u201d Image Image Image \u201cTHE GOAL IS FOR THE ROBOTS TO ALWAYS BE ON AND DEALING WITH WHATEVER COMES THEIR WAY. THAT IS A GRAND CHALLENGE FOR ROBOTICS.\u201d - Peter Stone The computing and engineering challenges have vast game-changing potential for how robots could be deployed in several areas. Texas Robotics, a robust consortium of interdisciplinary researchers led by the College of Natural Sciences and Cockrell School of Engineering , is working to advance the field. Texas Robotics\u2019 collaborative projects explore robotics\u2019 numerous application spaces including social, surgical, rehabilitation, vehicles, drilling, manufacturing, space, nuclear and defense. Peter Stone , director of Texas Robotics, principal investigator for UT Austin\u2019s robotics research with the Army Futures Command and prominent AI expert on machine learning and dynamic environments, says the university is focusing on two major growth areas. The first is long-term autonomy, the ability for robots to operate self-sufficiently for hours or days rather than seconds or minutes. The second is human-robot interaction that includes autonomous robots that are interacting with people in an unstructured environment. This requires the robot to have the ability to respond to and communicate with humans whether in a health care setting, on the street or during a mission. \u201cThe goal is for the robots to always be on and dealing with whatever comes their way,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThat is a grand challenge for robotics.\u201d Centralizing these efforts makes UT Austin an attractive full-service robotics group for industry and government partners, Stone says. \u201cOver the past five or six years, we have banded together and formed an interdisciplinary group that has an educational component and that has an industry affiliates program. We can explore a lot of synergies across a lot of different perspectives.\u201d Historically, getting new technologies to the soldiers has been a slow process. The Army Futures Command\u2019s mission is to modernize and speed up that process and \u201cForge the Future.\u201d In 2018, the Army selected Austin, Texas, as the headquarters for the command after considering cities across the country. The city stood out as an ideal location because of its combination of high-tech and science-related industries, the state government, and the academic reach of UT Austin. \u201cUT\u2019s location in the technological hub that is Austin, our status of having a top-five-ranked program in AI and our leadership on a brand new artificial intelligence institute funded by the National Science Foundation help show that our friends in the military selected its robotics research partner wisely in picking UT,\u201d says Paul Goldbart, dean of the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cInnovation has been happening in the government and in leading research universities for decades,\u201d says Sharon L. Wood, dean of the Cockrell School of Engineering. \u201cBut now that we\u2019re working together to address specific challenges, we can expand our resources and accelerate the speed at which we roll out new technologies. This is a win-win for both UT Austin and the U.S. Army.\u201d Today, UT Austin remains fully committed to discovery and advancing the research that could help the world. A keystone project in the Army Futures Command partnership is the newly renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium, the centralized home for Texas Robotics. Image The newly finished robotics laboratory in the renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium. The new space is both a research lab and public showcase for all the robotics on campus. The university committed to building the space last year. The lab benefits the larger robotics program and the military partnership as a hub for cross-disciplinary collaborative research. The ribbon cutting ceremony for the lab was held Oct. 2, 2020, with special guest speakers Gov. Greg Abbott, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cTexas is ground zero for the next generation of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, robotics, and all these different strategies that will not only be advancing the United States Army, but will be advancing the next level of technology across the entire globe, with Austin being the centerpiece of it,\u201d said Gov. Abbott. Image Peter Stone (left), Gov. Greg Abbott (center) and Sec. of the Army Ryan McCarthy (right) at the opening event. \"TEXAS IS GROUND ZERO FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CYBERSECURITY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS.\" - Gov. Greg Abbott \u201cOur commitment to the Army knows no bounds,\u201d said President Hartzell at the ribbon cutting. \u201cWe are a world-class partner and destination for the military, veterans and their families.\u201d \u201cThe university\u2019s dedication starts right from the leadership at the top all the way down to the research assistants carrying out the projects,\u201d says Seth Wilk, director of the UT Austin Liaison Office to the Army Futures Command. Partnering with the military helps foster collaboration with government and industry, and it supports impactful academic research. Stone notes having the military involvement is incredibly useful for research inspiration and creates a path to impact. A few Army employees are working on campus and embedded in the partner projects from the beginning to help make it more efficient and effective. In addition to autonomous robotics, the Army\u2019s priorities include improving navigation, next generation vehicles such as self-driving cars and vertical lift aircraft, material development, and synthetic training environments. \u201cWhile other institutions are feeling pressure to pull back in these uncertain times, UT Austin remains committed. We understand that, just as critical technologies have allowed for productivity, connection and engagement amid a pandemic, we must ensure future technologies are there when we need them, too,\u201d says Goldbart. \u201cThis requires providing researchers with opportunities to solve today\u2019s intellectual puzzles and bring about profound and positive breakthroughs to help society address and overcome future challenges.\u201d Cross-posted from the UT News website.

    "text_content": "Yaskawa Partnership Accelerates Robotics Research at The University of Texas at Austin | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Yaskawa Partnership Accelerates Robotics Research at The University of Texas at Austin Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Monday, April 5, 2021 Dr. Chetan Kapoor with a dual-arm, SDA10F robot. Yaskawa, a global manufacturer of servos, motion controllers, AC motor drives, switches, and industrial robots, is establishing a partnership with The University of Texas at Austin. This partnership is marked with a gift of a dual-arm, SDA10F robot that will be available for the use of the Texas Robotics faculty. The partnership aims to facilitate interdisciplinary research and innovation within the robotics community in the university. Chetan Kapoor , who leads R&D at Yaskawa America, Motoman Robotics Division, spearheaded this partnership initiative. Kapoor earned his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin in 1996, and served as an Associate Research Director at the university for over 10 years, leading a team of researchers in the field of robotic systems. He founded Agile Planet based on technology licensed from UT Austin, a company that was later acquired by Yaskawa in 2013. Kapoor emphasized that progress in robotics will require interdisciplinary technologies and research, and that the Texas Robotics program offers the ideal infrastructure and expertise to aid in this progress. Their expertise spans from mechanical design, control systems, modeling, and artificial intelligence, and is a key reason for gifting the robot. \u201cThe robot we\u2019re giving UT is very capable mechanically\u2026but we feel that we can take it to the next level,\u201d Kapoor said when asked about the timing of the partnership. Image Dr. Mitch Pryor Kapoor\u2019s time at The University of Austin brought him into close contact with Mitch Pryor , a Research Scientist and Lecturer for the Cockrell School of Engineering at UT Austin and co-founder of the Nuclear Robotics Group and the Drilling & Rig Automation Group. \u201cChetan was finishing his Ph.D. when I began graduate school in \u201895. The first paper that I ever published was with Chetan,\u201d said Pryor about his early experiences working with Kapoor. Pryor and Kapoor\u2019s decades-long professional relationship has helped solidified the partnership and highlighted how the University of Texas maintains strong ties with industry leaders to help foster innovation. This initiative also signals a trend that the university has been moving toward: creating systems, spaces, and organizations to help researchers in various fields manage cross-collaborative relationships and better communicate the value of their work. Kapoor cited Texas Robotics as being representative of this trend. \u201cIn the past, [robotics research] was really siloed,\u201d he stated. Texas Robotics encourages researchers from computer science and engineering disciplines to work more closely together. \u201cWe can use the cross-disciplinary approach to solve the hard problems in robotics,\u201d said Kapoor. Pryor described one of the most significant research applications enabled by the gift as \u201cadvancing fundamental research of controlling redundant systems.\u201d Described as having \u201chuman-like flexibility,\u201d the SDA10F has impressive mechanical function. This capability, however, is limited as the robot lacks the ability to perceive, plan, and act autonomously. \u201cAs an example, the SDA10F is today mechanically capable of assembling an Ikea office chair. However, every step of the assembly process must be manually programmed and all chair components typically found in fixed, precise locations. This reduces the practical application of this robot. Research at UT can bridge this gap by augmenting this robot with perception, modeling, and reasoning,\u201d said Pryor. This partnership also enables research that has applications in the medical field. Pryor noted that Dr. Farshid Alambeigi and Dr. Ashish D. Deshpande were likely to use the robot in the immediate future. \u201cBoth of them do a lot of work with robots for medical applications, including rehabilitation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a great next step. The fact that UT faculty has access to the Anna Hiss Gym creates an opportunity for Yaskawa to engage more people.\u201d News Categories Alumni Industry Relations Research Tags robotics Yaskawa Chetan Kapoor Mitch Pryor Texas Robotics",

Industry analysts say that more data has been collected in the past two years than in all of human history combined. Data about what we buy, what we watch, where we go and who our friends are is constantly being collected and stored. Analyzing all that data and gaining insights from it is the hard part. Image Keshav Pingali Image Chris Rossbach Enter University of Texas at Austin computer science professor Keshav Pingali and assistant professor Chris Rossbach , founders of Katana Graph , a startup specializing in graph computing. The startup launched in the spring and already has raised $4.4 million. Intel recently announced a new partnership with the company to support those hoping to translate large, unstructured data sets into efficient solutions to problems. Katana Graph's graph computing engine will be offered on several of Intel's platforms. You may not have heard of graph computing, but companies that use graph computing are likely using it now to learn about you. Graphs are a way of drawing insights from unstructured data. Structured data is what is found in a carefully constructed database where relationships between data are clear. Unstructured data do not have clear relationships, and that's where graphs come in. Imagine an airline route map, with lines connecting hub cities with smaller cities. There may not be a direct flight from Cincinnati to San Francisco, but it's still possible to get there. Just as finding the connecting flights allows for arrival at a destination, discovering connections between different data points using graphs helps businesses and organizations understand who they serve. For example, they help Netflix suggest what we should watch next and help Amazon tell us what to buy next. \"Graphs are a way of thinking about data,\" said Pingali, CEO of Katana Graph. \"They simplify the job of designing algorithms to process the data and extract insights.\" In the summer of 2019, Pingali, the W. A. \"Tex\" Moncrief, Jr. Chair in Distributed and Grid Computing, was visiting his sister in the San Francisco Bay Area following the sale of her startup company. After chatting with venture capitalists, Pingali pitched the idea for a graph computing company to Rossbach, who holds the Computer Sciences Endowed Faculty Fellowship No. 6 and has expertise in cloud computing. They formed Katana Graph, and the startup received its seed funding on March 15, 2020, just in time for the global pandemic to hit. It hasn't slowed them down much. Already, Katana Graph's engines are being used in pharmaceutical research to help narrow down which molecular compounds should be tested in the lab, epidemiological tracking of COVID-19, computer network security and detection of financial fraud. \"The pandemic makes collaboration a little harder,\" said Rossbach. \"There are definitely times when it would be great to have a whiteboard. But by and large, we've made a lot of progress and continue to have a lot of fun and largely be unaffected, so I think we're very lucky in that regard.\" Pingali and Rossbach credit some of the success of their company's launch to the support they received from UT Austin. \"The college has been incredibly supportive of this, from our chair to the dean,\" Pingali said. \"Everywhere wants to be the next Silicon Valley, but putting that sort of desire into action, into something that actually makes things happen, that's a totally different thing. And not many places can do it.\" Katana Graph also received support from the Texas Innovation Center , the hub at The University of Texas at Austin for bringing engineering and science discoveries and technologies to the market. The Texas Innovation Center is a collaboration between the Cockrell School of Engineering and the College of Natural Sciences which provides resources to help connect companies like Katana Graph with potential customers, investors, mentors, and other needed resources to support translation of university research. Through the center, IP support is provided by the Office of Technology Commercialization. \"This recent partnership with Intel and an expected new round of funding will fuel an accelerated growth for Katana Graph and adoption of its graph engine,\" said Dr. Van Truskett, executive director of the Texas Innovation Center. \"Katana Graph is recruiting and employing UT students to work at their company. Their success is an example of impact that university research and their resulting startups can have on the economy.\" Cross-posted from the College of Natural Sciences website News Categories Faculty Tags startups Keshav Pingali Chris Rossbach Intel Katana Graph entrepreneurship",

Collins is president of the Association of Black Computer Scientists (ABCS), which seeks to create paths to educational and professional success for Black and other underrepresented students in this major. Amid the pandemic earlier this year, she met with fellow senior and close friend Am\u00e9rica Quistiano. She is president of the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS), which has similar aims for Hispanic and Latinx students. Together, these two leaders drafted plans to bring about social change for students at the departmental level. Black and Hispanic/Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields, and today computer science is no different. As the leaders of their respective organizations, Collins and Quistiano saw firsthand how underserved and underrepresented students were personally affected. Many of their members were the first in their families to pursue a technical degree or any degree at all, and they were struggling in their high-school-to-college transitions. Meanwhile, other members had to work multiple jobs on top of full-time enrollment to support themselves financially. Collins and Quistiano saw these challenges and wanted to help and support these students. Image Audra Collins is president of the Association of Black Computer Scientists (ABCS). Image Am\u00e9rica Quistiano is president of the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS). \u201cIt was really two sides coming together,\u201d Quistiano said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to establish funding or scholarships of sorts since forever, but for one reason or another, it just never worked out.\u201d While Collins and Quistiano were working on their plans, UT\u2019s Department of Computer Science was actually at work behind the scenes establishing similar initiatives. These initiatives were in line with those proposed by longtime department staff members Amy Bush and Kay Nettle, who wanted to help start a scholarship to aid more of those students who had the ability but not the means to study computer science at UT. With the department matching Bush and Nettle\u2019s funds, the mutual goals of the students, staff and department came together to create the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change. \u201cWe have been part of the computer science department, as students and employees, for over 50 years combined, and we\u2019ve seen it change in many ways. Helping promote diversity in a department that has meant so much to both of us is a pretty amazing legacy,\u201d said Bush and Nettle. Beginning this year, the endowment will support diversity and inclusion efforts and fund opportunities for underserved students with a demonstrated passion for technology. \u201cBeing a first generation student myself, growing up there wasn\u2019t really anyone for me or many of these students to ask about computer science,\u201d Quistiano said. \u201cI was laughably unaware of how the tech industry worked and the academics of it all. For example, for the longest time, I thought there was only like one technology major to give you one technology job.\u201d Quistiano said that she and Collins hoped to create a network of support and mutual understanding among these students. While ABCS and HACS do just that, the two leaders saw that it wasn\u2019t enough for those who were struggling financially. They wanted to do more and saw this project as an opportunity to get the department to better acknowledge these students and understand their perspectives. \u201cDiversity\u2019s not just who you admit, but also who has the support to stay and actually successfully complete their degree,\u201d Collins said. Brent Winkelman, chief of staff of the department, wholeheartedly agrees, citing the department\u2019s long-standing focus on not just recruitment but also long-term retention \u2014 which many institutions may overlook. \u201cThere are occasions when we may successfully recruit a student, but then the student gets in and discovers, \u2019Gosh, this environment is just not a home for me,\u2019\u201d Winkelman explained. \u201cAs a department, we\u2019re committed to doing the work to ensure that no student has that reaction. We want this to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome.\u201d Image ABCS and HACS members from their 2019 fall kickoff meeting. (Photo credit - Am\u00e9rica Quistiano) Winkelman said that there are a number of initiatives in the works directed toward diversity and inclusion and that the department is looking to scale up programs such as First Bytes , a camp designed to expose high school women to futures in computer science, and Code Longhorn , a similar program designed for underrepresented populations throughout Texas. \u201cThese initiatives are great because what starts here changes the world, right? But how can you change the world if the people creating and building new things are not actually representative of the world \u2014 if not everyone is included in that discussion?\u201d Quistiano asked. As for the beginnings of the new endowment, Collins said they conducted extensive research on their own time into budgeting, editing, writing and drafting proposals. They reached out to computer science professor Alison Norman, who is also chair of the department\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion Committee, for mentorship and guidance. Norman was not at all surprised when Collins and Quistiano contacted her. \u201cOur students are amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking and caring, and they really want to have a positive effect on the world and are always hungry for information about just how to do that.\u201d Norman provided advice and proofread their early drafts. \u201cWe wanted to be as best prepared as we could be before any sort of archetypal proposal,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAlison helped our efforts immensely, and we were very persistent,\u201d she said laughing. After the department learned of Collins\u2019 and Quistiano\u2019s ideas, both sides worked together. \u201cI think that everybody\u2019s goals were aligned, and then, it was just a matter of how to best achieve those goals,\u201d said Norman of the project. Soon enough, their persistence and the hard work of the staff and faculty paid off. Many, many presentations, virtual meetings, discussions and considerations later, the endowment was officially established, and it started in fall 2020. Today the endowment is listed on HornRaiser for donations, and its scholarships are available to current and incoming undergraduate computer science students who have participated in Code Longhorn or who are current or future members of HACS or ABCS. \u201cThe effort for diversity and inclusion has always been there student org-wise,\u201d Collins said, \u201cbut what I wanted to establish is that once I graduate and leave the computer science department, the staff, actual department and administration \u2014 they\u2019re now the ones leading the charge.\u201d Quistiano added: \u201cThis is just the beginning. Hopefully the endowment will grow and provide support for generations of future students to come \u2014 and that\u2019s the mark we want to leave.\u201d And the university is proud to uphold that legacy. \u201cUT houses a lot of world-class students in terms of their talent and abilities, and also in their desire to have a positive impact,\u201d Winkelman said. \u201cAnd I think that we have seen that repeatedly from students like Audra and Am\u00e9rica who have asked the department to think more ambitiously about how we can create change.\u201d Cross-posted from UT News .

    "text_content": "Student Mindful of What We Owe to Education | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Student Mindful of What We Owe to Education Posted by Angela Schiff on Monday, November 18, 2019 Education is powerful \u2014 it\u2019s a means to inciting progress in the world, empowering individuals and transforming lives. Education\u2019s role in facilitating positive change is a major theme in Texas Computer Science student Dora Gurfinkel\u2019s life. She\u2019s so aware of it, in fact, that she is using her education to elicit real change within the university while paying homage to her family\u2019s unique history. Dora was born in Venezuela but has lived the majority of her life in the United States; she holds dual citizenship. Her last name, Gurfinkel, sometimes causes people to ask questions. \u201cIt\u2019s not a normal Latinx last name,\u201d she admits. Her grandfather, Mariano Gurfinkel, is a man of Polish and Jewish origins and lived through the Holocaust. He survived imprisonment in Auschwitz and once free, traveled to Venezuela as it was one of the few countries readily accepting Holocaust survivors. Mariano\u2019s story resonates with Dora because, \u201cafter coming from no family and belongings,\u201d he attended both MIT and UC Berkeley, and ultimately established a long-lasting career in diplomatic oil relations. His experience, in Dora\u2019s opinion, is part of why her family deeply values education and why the value was embedded into her upbringing. Image The Gurfinkel family As a whole, the Gurfinkel family is full of awe-inspiring stories. Her grandmother, Laura Castillo de Gurfinkel, was Minister of Education in Venezuela and worked toward modernizing and improving the county\u2019s education system. Dora\u2019s father, Mariano E. Gurfinkel, attended MIT like his namesake and returned to Venezuela to work for the state oil company. However, her family left the country during the political turmoil in the early 2000s. On discussing their decision to leave, Dora\u2019s parents said that \u201cwe left before we were going to be used by the regime for their benefit or denied livelihood.\u201d The family immigrated to the United States, an opportunity that they had due to her father\u2019s educational background. The ability of education to open doors and better one\u2019s situation was ingrained in her growing up. Dora said that a prevailing belief was \u201cthe importance of education and what we owe to it as a family.\u201d When speaking with Dora, one can sense how her family\u2019s history has shaped her values and direction. She takes her education seriously, but her path to The University of Texas and Texas Computer Science wasn\u2019t a straight line. Dora decided to attend the university to remain close to her family, adding that \u201cmy dad joked \u2018If you want me to retire, you\u2019ll go to UT.\u2019 \u201d She initially majored in chemistry but, in the back of her mind, considered switching her major. She hesitated because she \u201cnever saw [herself] as someone who would be in computer science\u201d plus, she added, \u201csometimes you have people explicitly say it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d Still, she took the plunge and decided to double major in computer science and math, noting that the fields appealed to her because there\u2019s an \u201celegance and power\u201d in them. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely human-created...the design and system only exist in the way that it does because [humans] decided that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Though she still has her struggles, Dora said that her mindset has changed considerably. \u201cI was able to grow into believing \u2018It\u2019s OK if you fail, you can grow from it.\u201d During her time at the university, Dora has worked in the UT community as a member of the Natural Sciences Council to amplify the voices and concerns of underrepresented communities in the college. She founded the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and ensured that those topics are included in conversations regarding the future of the college. Dora emphasized that, in her efforts, she was \u201cable to include the students who were directly being affected as opposed to advocating on behalf of them.\u201d This work, however, is only a single part of her greater love for service and community advocacy. Now that her graduation draws closer, Dora is considering how her experience in Texas Computer Science and her advocacy will affect the trajectory of her career. A possible field is tackling ethics in the technology sector. More than ever, tech shapes our lives in ways that aren\u2019t always aligned with ethical behavior. These issues appeal to her desire to create a better, more just world. Dora wants to solve problems with a tangible societal impact that also allows her to use her technical skills. \u201cTech is structuring how society will look tomorrow, and there\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure that it\u2019s a society that we will want to live in.\u201d News Categories Undergraduate Program Undergraduate Students Tags diversity diversity and inclusion natural sciences council Dora Gurfinkel undergraduate",

Authorship credit goes to Faith Singer-Villalobos. By 2025, the global high performance computing (HPC) market is forecasted to account for $50 billion, up $15 billion from 2019. Fueled by the growth of big data, artificial intelligence, and 3-D imaging, HPC is increasingly used to drive commercial, industrial, and personal usage. Scientists and users in industry alike are increasingly applying HPC infrastructures such as compute clusters, networking, and storage to support big data applications. These applications utilize larger, more complex data sets that can overwhelm traditional data processing resources. As the proportion of supercomputer cycles devoted to big data fields such as machine learning, fMRI, and experimental particle physics analyses grows, the workloads of HPC and big data are converging and require hardware and software resources capable of supporting each on equal footing. To address this challenge in today's HPC data centers, a new partnership has been forged among the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology and The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), specifically the UT Austin Portugal program , the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) , and the Department of Computer Science . Wavecom , a private wireless company in Portugal, is leading the effort and plans to market the outcomes to the computing community in Portugal and beyond. The project \u2014 BigHPC: A Management Framework for Consolidated Big Data and HPC \u2014 started in April 2020 and includes $2 million in funding over the next three years. \"It's an honor that we were selected to work with Portugal on this important project,\" said Vijay Chidambaram , one of two principal investigators on the grant and a professor in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. The UT Austin Portugal program dates back to 2007, and is one of several partnerships between the Portuguese government and research institutions. The program's goal is to elevate science and technology in Portugal while fostering strong partnerships to help universities continue to innovate. The partnership with UT Austin was extended in 2018, continuing the alliance until at least 2030. Image Todd Evans, HPC Performance & Architectures Group, Texas Advanced Computing Center \"The idea of the BigHPC grant is to focus on practical R&D that will lead to real applications for scientists whether they're in industry, academia, or a national lab,and transfer that knowledge into the commercial sector,\" said Todd Evans, who is a member of TACC's HPC Performance & Architectures Group and the second principal investigator on the grant. \"The project will also contribute to building the much needed capacity to implement and manage HPC and big data services in academia and industry,\" Evans said. The result will be a novel solution for monitoring and managing the infrastructure, data, and applications of current and next-generation HPC data centers, while ensuring the best performance and resource usage for applications and infrastructures. It will also enable both big data analytics applications and traditional HPC to be deployed using heterogeneous hardware and run in the same environment. Experts from TACC and the Minho Advanced Computing Centre (MACC) in Portugal will help integrate the tools developed into a single software bundle that will be validated through real use-cases and a pilot deployed in both the TACC and MACC data centers. The project will also leverage the expertise in HPC and big data management of researchers from the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science , a Portuguese non-profit that acts as an interface between academia and industry; and the Laboratory of Instrumentation and Experimental Particle Physics , a state-run Portuguese research laboratory founded in 1986. When a scientist conducts computational research, good results depend on the efficiency of the underlying infrastructure. This was highlighted when researchers at UT Austin recently mapped the spread of COVID-19. \"The COVID-19 research translated into tasks that were run on TACC's supercomputers,\" Chidambaram said. \"If we can make the systems in TACC's data center more efficient, we will directly speed up how long it takes to run these tasks. This helps researchers conducting science decrease time to solution.\" MODERN-DAY HPC CHALLENGES Academic and industry data centers are rising to meet new challenges in the HPC environment. Chidambaram says the two primary challenges are managing new, heterogeneous storage and virtualization technologies in data centers in an efficient manner; and the fact that traditional software needs to be modified to work with new storage technologies. \"HPC has been focused on very traditional techniques that have been around for more than 30 years,\" Chidambaram said. \"These techniques are often not well-suited to new hardware.\" Image Vijay Chidambaram (center), Department of Computer Science, UT Austin. Chidambaram's lab \u2014 the UT Systems and Storage Lab \u2014 is working to build the next generation of storage technologies. For example, persistent memory is a new capability that provides very low latency access to data, but also has very unique characteristics. \"If you used persistent memory like you would a magnetic hard drive, you're not going to get all the benefit you can from that device,\" Chidambaram added. \"Similarly, in terms of virtualization technologies back when HPC really took off, there wasn't a notion of running containers. This is widespread in the field now.\" Containers are a method of packaging an application with many software components along with complex dependencies to run high-end applications. They have altered the development of software today because they hide the complexity and make the deployment easier. \"Coping with heterogeneous hardware, large-scale infrastructure, and the different HPC application requirements is challenging,\" Evans said. \"Even if an application exists and is vetted, it can be extremely labor intensive to modify it to run in a particular environment or on a particular system. Secondly, it's challenging to build an application such that it's taking advantage of the hardware capabilities that are available to it.\" Chidambaram's lab \u2014 the UT Systems and Storage Lab \u2014 is working to build the next generation of storage technologies. To do this effectively, he needs partners. \"It's one thing to generally know what HPC requires. It's quite another thing to talk directly to the people who are managing the clusters and data centers,\" Chidambaram said. \"TACC is excited to be involved,\" Evans said. \"It gives us an opportunity to think in a deeper way about virtualization, specifically container technologies that are becoming more prevalent.\" \"You can't practically build some of these packages from scratch anymore, particularly in relatively restrictive HPC environments, so you need containers to support applications,\" Evans continued. \"This project is going a step further by sharing container-supported applications that are able to run in an optimal way for a given hardware configuration.\" Many areas of the overall scientific community will benefit from the BigHPC grant \u2014 academic supercomputing centers, industrial data centers, national labs, and nonprofits. Chidambaram concluded: \"Typically, these proposals are only academic. In this instance, we have TACC and MACC to provide on-the-ground experience running supercomputers in an educational setting for research. We have Wavecom to talk with us about industrial productions problems. And we have non-profits experienced in bridging academic and industrial efforts. We're all hoping to learn how best to manage data centers now and in the future, and how best we can use storage and virtualization technologies. Our collaborators will tell us whether our ideas make sense and work in the real world.\" News Categories Faculty Industry Relations Research Tags TACC Big Data Artificial Intelligence high-performance computing Portugal BigHPC Vijay Chidambaram Todd Evans",

    "text_content": "Texas CS Alumnus Joins the Race to Build Self-Driving Trucks | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Texas CS Alumnus Joins the Race to Build Self-Driving Trucks Posted by Spoorthi Krishnaraj on Thursday, January 23, 2020 Locomation trucks in convoy formation The race to build the best autonomous cargo vehicle is heating up, indicating big developments for the $700 billion U.S. trucking market . With the rise of e-commerce comes the accompanying need for more efficiently delivered goods, a demand that the transportation industry is not currently equipped to cope with. Self-driving trucks could solve this problem by simultaneously decreasing the cost and increasing the safety of freight transport. Texas Computer Science (TXCS) alumnus, Dr. Tekin Meri\u00e7li , strives to achieve this goal every day. He serves as the CTO of Locomation , a company that aims to create self-driving semi trucks, and oversees the technology operations that go into making these intelligent vehicles. Developing autonomous driving technology is a herculean task, but Dr. Meri\u00e7li approaches the problem by breaking it down into incremental, more achievable targets, and then sequentially building towards the goal of fully driverless vehicles. The first milestone is to create a relay convoy, which involves a human-driven lead truck that is then succeeded at a safe distance by a self-driven follow truck. This perfectly combines the reciprocal benefits of driver augmentation and autonomy, because people are good at high-level cognition, whereas robots are good at low-level visual servoing and control. Image Texas CS alumnus, Dr. Tekin Meri\u00e7li According to Dr. Meri\u00e7li, what sets his approach apart is the understanding that the path to full autonomy is a gradual and incremental one. And it has certainly paid off - his technology will soon be ready to be deployed for test drives on public roads, and he was recently featured in an article about emerging leaders in Pittsburgh tech. Dr. Meri\u00e7li credits the foundational aspects of his accomplishments to his time as a graduate student at UT. He still fondly remembers the interactions he had with the \u201cbrilliant minds\u201d of the TXCS faculty, and how he was able to gain the experiences that set him up for his incredible success today. \u201cUT opened doors for me,\u201d he says. \u201c[It] was quite instrumental in my career.\u201d Dr. Meri\u00e7li came to UT Austin in 2005 to pursue a master\u2019s degree in computer science, after becoming interested in robotics and AI during his undergraduate studies in Istanbul. He still fondly remembers riding segways from his research lab down the near-empty passageways of Taylor Hall (the old Texas Computer Science building) while pulling all-nighters, and how it took him weeks to get adjusted to the Texas heat when he first moved here from Turkey. While at UT, Dr. Meri\u00e7li was heavily involved with UT Austin\u2019s RoboCup team, Austin Villa , directed by Dr. Peter Stone . Dr. Meri\u00e7li also worked with Dr. Stone in the Learning Agents Research Group (LARG) , with Dr. Risto Miikkulainen on projects using artificial neural networks to model a biological neuron, and with Dr. Ben Kuipers on position estimation code for an intelligent wheelchair project. Most notably, and most relevant to the work he does now, Dr. Meri\u00e7li contributed to UT\u2019s team for the DARPA Urban Challenge , a driverless car competition funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the most prominent research organization of the United States Department of Defense. His time at UT propelled Dr. Meri\u00e7li into future work on robotics and AI. After completing his master\u2019s degree, he went on to pursue a PhD and several postdoctoral fellowships in the field of intelligent robotics. In 2015, Dr. Meri\u00e7li joined the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) as a senior engineer. This past year, Dr. Meri\u00e7li took a leave of absence from NREC to realize his goal of implementing AI solutions to build autonomous driving technologies for large semi trucks.

    "text_content": "Bridging the Gap Between Industry and Academia | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Bridging the Gap Between Industry and Academia Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, January 14, 2021 UT Austin collaborates with Bosch to drive automated research Texas Computer Science has recently launched a collaborative research partnership sponsored by Bosch to explore new frontiers of research on reinforcement learning for automated driving. The partnership was envisioned by Professor Peter Stone of the UTCS faculty and Dr. Kay Stepper , the Senior VP who oversees Bosch\u2019s automated driving efforts in North America. The successful implementation of truly driverless vehicles is proving to be even more formidable than originally anticipated. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply a straightforward application of existing technologies. Automated driving continues to present deep research questions,\u201d says Dr. Stepper. \"Combining UT\u2019s expertise in robotics, AI, and machine learning with Bosch\u2019s experience as a global provider of mobility technologies will help us meet those challenges.\u201d Image UTCS Alum and Bosch Autonomous Driving Development site co-lead, Dr. Brad Knox The Bosch team is co-led by Dr. Brad Knox and Dr. Alessandro Allievi. This unique venture will facilitate their collaboration with UTCS faculty and students, drawing on the incredible resources within the department to do groundbreaking research. According to UTCS alumnus Dr. Knox, \u201cautomated driving is compelling because it combines robotics and AI, its potential economic impact is vast, and there is broad interest in the topic right now.\u201d Image Bosch Autonomous Driving Development site co-lead, Dr. Alessandro Allievi Dr. Allievi shares, \u201cIt\u2019s the best of two worlds. At UT Austin Computer Science, we are uniquely situated to be fully-embedded contributing members of the academic research community, while  remaining an integral part of an industry-leading automotive technology group.\u201d One of the primary goals for the partnership is to conduct published research. The Bosch team is currently embedded within Stone\u2019s Learning Agents Research Group (LARG). Professor Stone happened to be Knox's advisor during his PhD program at UT, so for Knox, this project is like \u201cbeing back home\u201d in a way. \u201cThey've been great to work with,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThey're a very positive influence on both the intellectual and social culture of the lab,  and I look forward to publishing many impactful papers with them over the coming years.\u201d The researchers are also collaborating with other faculty members, such as Professor Scott Niekum , effectively acting as co-supervisors to some of their students. \"Dr. Knox and Dr. Allievi have a unique blend of expertise in machine learning, human-robot interaction, and practical engineering that makes them great collaborators to have at UT,\u201d says Niekum. He adds, \u201cBosch has extensive experience with real-world applications, such as vehicle automation and driver assistance, that serve as excellent motivation and benchmarks for the fundamental  research we perform.\u201d The Bosch team and their UTCS collaborators are working on fundamental research on reinforcement learning, which is a sub discipline of machine learning. The way Knox explains their focus, \u201cyou could take almost any intelligent robot software \u2013 including that for  automated vehicles \u2013 and split it into two parts: the sensing/perception side and the decision- making side.\u201d The joint research team is particularly interested in the latter, applying machine learning to improve automated decision-making behaviors. Aside from this primary focus, they have the space to do research on broad fundamental topicsthat can apply to automated driving. \u201cPart of what\u2019s exciting about our research mission here is  that we\u2019re not constrained to doing applied research. We conduct research that we hope will have impact outside of automated driving as well,\u201d says Knox. According to Stone, the  work they are doing can have implications in a wide variety of applications\u2013 anything pertaining  to sequential decision making. \u201cI expect this partnership to increase both the breadth and impact  of artificial intelligence and robotics research at UT,\u201d says Niekum. While choosing a location to set up its integrated research group, Bosch was looking for a metropolitan tech hub that also had a strong university research presence, making UT Austin an  ideal candidate. The researchers established themselves onsite in July 2019, and already feel  at home in the department. As they grow in their research capacity, they plan to collaborate with  other professors as well. Although the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted their ability to work  onsite, they are continuing their collaborative work remotely, are still part of LARG, and expect to fully resume onsite operation once the situation resolves.

Its mission is to create global leaders through providing selected students with hands-on, cross-cultural experience. Teams who apply for the award are tasked with examining a real-world problem affecting a specific geographical region, and creating and implementing a solution to it. After a rigorous selection process involving proposals and a pitch competition, one team is chosen from each of three regions. Selected teams each receive a generous $25,000 grant towards the implementation of their projects. This year, the winning team in the Southeast Asia and Oceania region is comprised of four students, one of whom is Texas Computer Science (TXCS) junior Rosaleen Xiong. \u201cI'm really honored and really excited to be able to use the skills that I\u2019ve built in TXCS to create this sort of project,\u201d says Xiong. The team is advised by TXCS professor Dr. Paul Toprac . \u201cFrom the beginning, I could tell that Xiong and the team were passionate about the project,\u201d says Dr. Toprac. \u201cThe project itself is exciting because it has the potential of helping many underserved and underprivileged people who need medical help. The combination is very compelling.\u201d Image Dr. Paul Toprac, Rosaleen Xiong, Shelby Hobohm, Shilpa Rajagopal, Nima Rahman, Dr. Aniruddhan Vasudevan The team of students is passionate about queer advocacy, as well as combining technology and health. They made it their mission to find a way to use technology as a solution for a pressing health problem. \u201cWe chose India because they recently decriminalized homosexuality in 2018, so this seemed like the right time to be discussing these sorts of issues and supporting people,\u201d says Xiong. The team pitched their project to be conducted in the South Indian city of Chennai. To get an on-the-ground look at the problem\u2019s scope and the best way to address it while researching the cultural implications, the team reached out to several local NGOs. After some brainstorming, they decided to create a mobile application that would enable Indian healthcare providers to equitably serve LGBTQIA+ patients by equipping them with useful resources, best practices, and other information. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this app can be a tool that they can use to fill the information gap,\u201d says Xiong. The app is broken up into different modules. Examples of content included in these modules are the history of queer rights in India, STI prevention, respectful communication and pronoun use, and how to promote inclusivity in patient intake forms. \u201cThe project will showcase how the Department of Computer Science at UT can create real-world software solutions to better the human condition. Ultimately, it is about leveraging the resources of UT and student talent to help those in need around the world,\u201d says Dr. Toprac. \u201cThis may sound cliche, but this is a clear case of What Starts Here Changes the World.\u201d Xiong seconds this notion. \u201cThe skills and frameworks and tools that I learned through my classes in TXCS have empowered me to be able to create this product that will change the lives of many across the globe,\u201d she says. Although their initial plan of traveling to India to conduct interviews and do on-site development work has been put on hold due to COVID-19, Xiong and her team are continuing to work on the project, and plan to implement a remote approach. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to still be conducting interviews over the summer,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty lucky because a lot of our work was building the app, which can still be made and shipped over as a product.\u201d Along the way, they\u2019re going to continue to rework and refine the app based on the feedback that they receive. The team has built the app so that it can be easily adapted. In the future, they hope to expand the product to other regions of India. They are also considering its applicability to general health in the United States. News Categories Awards & Honors Undergraduate Students",

These graphs are rich with useful information, and can be used to determine patterns and relationships among the stored data. This process of discovering relevant patterns from graphs is called Graph Pattern Mining (GPM). A team of Texas Computer Science (TXCS) researchers advised by Dr. Keshav Pingali has done groundbreaking work to make GPM programs more efficient and accessible. Their work was recently accepted to Very Large Databases (VLDB) 2020 , one of the premier conferences in computer science. GPM has applications in many areas, including chemical engineering, bioinformatics, and social sciences. For example, protein behavior can be mapped to a graph by representing the proteins as the vertices and the interactions between them as edges. Using a  GPM program, researchers would be able to make useful discoveries about the data, such as finding frequent patterns that occur within the graph and what features they relate to. This information would then shine light on the etiology of a disease and enhance drug discovery. The applications of these programs are seemingly endless. However, GPM problems are computationally complicated, memory-intensive and time-consuming to solve. Although a lot of work has been done to attempt to make it easy for programmers to develop GPM applications, these solutions are generally not very efficient or flexible, using distributed systems or disks to manage the intermediate data structures. Image The TXCS research team decided to find a streamlined approach to solve GPM problems, through using a single multi-core CPU or a single GPU and utilizing the memory and computation resources available on the hardware to their maximum potential. \u201cOur system handles all the complexities regarding parallelization, synchronization, memory management and so on,\u201d says Dr. Roshan Dathathri , a collaborator on the project. \u201cSo the programmer only has to specify the application logic\u2014what are they trying to find, what are they trying to mine from the graphs.\u201d The system they developed, called Pangolin, provides a simple programming interface to do this. At the moment, Pangolin runs efficiently on a single multi core CPU or a single GPU, but its functionality still has room to grow. \u201cThe goal is to enable larger graphs and also larger patterns that could be mined within a reasonable amount of time,\u201d says Dr. Xuhao Chen , the project\u2019s lead researcher. Their paper is set to be published in VLDB at the end of the month. News Categories Research",

Photo credit - Vivian Abagiu. NEWS From the College of Natural Sciences by Marc G Airhart It was 2006 when Juan Sequeda (BS '08, PhD '15), then a new UT Austin computer science transfer student, saw a fellow undergraduate drop a bunch of papers on the floor. When he bent over to help pick up the papers, he was surprised to see that they were research articles about an obscure subfield in computer science that Sequeda himself had recently become obsessed with: the Semantic Web. The term referred to a proposed system of organizing and tagging all the information on the Internet so that autonomous agents could find and make sense of it. Thanks in part to that chance encounter in a University of Texas at Austin classroom, Sequeda and his advisor, professor Daniel Miranker ultimately were able to invent a powerful new way to transform, if not all the Internet's information, at least some key data stored in different ways in different places, into a form that made it vastly easier to analyze. And that in turn led to the launch of a start-up based on University of Texas at Austin research\u2014Capsenta, a computer science spin-out recently acquired by another company. Although roughly 9 of 10 startups fail , Capsenta flourished. In June, data.world acquired it and named Sequeda its principal scientist and Miranker an adviser. Image Juan Sequeda (BS '08, PhD '15), principal scientist at data.world. Photo credit - Vivian Abagiu. No Easy Answers Sequeda first become captivated by the Semantic Web when a visiting professor at his former school, the Universidad de Valle in Cali, Colombia, gave a lecture on it and described how its tools were making searches more powerful. A semantic approach would be able to determine, for example, whether a search for \"Paris Hilton\" was about a person or a hotel in the city of Paris, and if it was about a hotel, whether it was in Paris, France or Paris, Texas. \"It got me thinking about what the next generation of the web might look like, and I definitely wanted to be part of that,\" Sequeda said. Sequeda learned that the student whose papers he helped pick up was doing research with Miranker, whom Sequeda then tracked down, asking to join his team. Miranker said yes\u2014and that he had just the problem to tackle. At the heart of the problem was helping businesses get answers to simple questions that proved nearly impossible to resolve when information is spread out in multiple databases and recorded differently. A manager may wonder: how much income did we earn from sales last year? But if your Canadian sales team records sales in Canadian dollars in one database, while your U.S. sales team uses American dollars in another, it takes a lot of work to extract the appropriate data, make it consistent and find the answer. Or if, you're a scientist at a pharmaceutical company needing to compare data from different ongoing clinical studies, one database using metric units and another using imperial units becomes a problem. \"Software developers for a Big Data analysis project may spend as much as 90 percent of their time wrangling data and just 10 percent or their time analyzing the data,\" Miranker said. Turning Data into Knowledge Miranker envisioned an automated method for merging databases, unlike what existing\u2014and often cumbersome\u2014data integration software offered. First, it would translate each conventional database into something called a knowledge graph, and second, merge those graphs together into one big, seamless graph. Then, asking questions of the graph should be so intuitive that even business managers could do it. \"Business people are the ones asking the questions, but they can't use their own data,\" Sequeda said. \"They have to go talk to their IT folks a lot and waste a bunch of time. The idea was: What if we could give the business users a view of their own data in a way that made sense to them so they could answer questions on their own?\" In a conventional database, information is stored in tables with columns and rows, kind of like a set of spreadsheets on steroids. In a knowledge graph, on the other hand, each chunk of data is linked to other chunks of data, like pushpins on a bulletin board connected by bits of string, and tagged with information explaining what each chunk of data is all about. Miranker challenged Sequeda as a junior undergraduate to develop an automated method for translating a conventional database into a knowledge graph, enabling simpler data analytics than a conventional database offered. Sequeda says he learned two important things working with Miranker. \"Number one, I learned to be comfortable in a sea of ambiguity,\" he said. \"You start out lost, but eventually, you'll figure out what the problem is that needs to be solved. The second thing is how to communicate the problem to others. You can't solve it unless you can define it.\" Image Daniel Miranker, professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. Photo credit - Vivian Abagiu. Wrap It Up Though he was making progress, as he was finishing his bachelor's degree in 2008, Sequeda had more to do. He told Miranker he wanted to continue researching with him through graduate school\u2014and to start a company based on their research. Miranker responded that a PhD wasn't needed to start a company. \"I said, 'That's true, but I want to be able to work on something that's a problem that's really hard that's never been solved before\u2014and that's what you do in a PhD program,'\" Sequeda recalled. \"'And I want to make sure that problem is related to industry, because if we solve it, it's going to be a business opportunity.'\" Within a couple of years, he was demonstrating a new piece of software called Ultrawrap, based on the work he did as an undergraduate, which automated the process of integrating relational databases. Instead of moving the data, Ultrawrap creates a virtual wrapper around the databases that allows users to access the information as a graph. One of its first applications was for Constitute , a project involving Zachary Elkins, a professor in UT Austin's Department of Government. Elkins had been working with colleagues in Illinois and London on a project to gather the text of the world's constitutions in one place for academic research. He asked Miranker for help developing an online portal that would allow anyone to search the constitutions of the world's nations and compare similar passages side by side. With funding from Google, Miranker and Sequeda used Ultrawrap to translate the constitutions into a knowledge graph, bringing the information out of the domain of academics and making it accessible to not only anyone curious about differences in the world's governments and cultures, but also to leaders in countries looking to revise their constitutions. Before long, the computer scientists were riding the success from Constitute to start Capsenta, a way to commercialize Ultrawrap. Miranker applied for a patent for the technology behind Ultrawrap and, when it was secured, negotiated a license with the university. For the first couple of years, he served as CEO. They were joined by Kyle Cox, former director of the UT Austin Technology Incubator, David Arnold, a consultant in healthcare IT, and later entrepreneur Wayne Heideman. Capsenta raised seed funding from LiveOak Venture Partners and other investors, and launched a series of projects, first in the healthcare industry and later in e-commerce, oil and gas, and elsewhere. Best of Both Worlds Earlier this year, when another Austin-based technology company, data.world, acquired Capsenta , it was seizing a chance to merge its own open, cloud-based platform\u2014in which users can add, integrate, share and query data\u2014with Capsenta's Ultrawrap technology, which allows users to keep their data in their own preferred databases, while accessing powerful analytical tools available for knowledge graphs. \"Our technology allows people to work in this graph world without having to move the data,\" Sequeda said. Capsenta overcame steep odds to find success in the business world. Miranker, who continues to teach and research at UT Austin, gives Sequeda much of the credit. \"He has an entrepreneurial spark and an irrepressible drive,\" said Miranker. For his part, Sequeda is grateful for his time at UT Austin and the mentorship he received from his professor. \"I am a scientist because of Dan,\" Sequeda said. \"This whole career that I started is thanks to his training and mentorship. He is like another father figure.\" News Categories Alumni Undergraduate Students",

While the idea of an artificial intelligence system may conjure images of an autonomous machine that rattles out facts like a hi-tech encyclopedia, complex AI exists only because a countless number of talented individuals dedicate their time toward refining these systems. Texas Computer Science (TXCS) graduate students Garrett Bingham and William Macke, under the advisement of TXCS professor Risto Miikkulainen , are contributing to the improvement of AI with their research. Their paper , entitled \u201cEvolutionary Optimization of Deep Learning Activation Functions\u201d was accepted into the 2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference . The work concerns the evolutionary optimization of activation functions as a potential means of improving neural networks, which may ultimately lead to the creation of smarter and more accurate AI. Image Professor Risto Miikkulainen A popular technique in machine learning is the use of neural networks: powerful tools that are able to learn complicated information by looking at and assessing vast amounts of training data. The TXCS researchers were focused on a specific part of the network: the activation function. This is the part that allows the system to learn complicated relationships from the training data. \u201cIt's similar to a biological neuron's action potential that determines whether a neuron in the brain fires or not. The difference is that in an artificial neural network, we have the flexibility to choose different activation functions,\u201d said Bingham. While machine learning researchers can pick any number of these functions, the team noticed that researchers tended to stick with \u201ca handful of activation functions that usually work pretty well.\u201d After all, why fix something that\u2019s not broken? Image Graduate student Garrett Bingham Limiting the scope of activation functions used in research can hurt innovations in the machine learning space. Activation functions are crucial to developing more complex and more efficient AI systems, but despite this acknowledgment, there remained a gap in the research space. \u201cThere isn't much research that looks at ways of discovering new activation functions that are better than the ones we currently use now,\u201d commented Bingham. The research team decided to discover new activation functions by exploring how biological processes could be applied to these artificial systems. They randomly generated about a hundred activation functions, analyzed their performance, and then created new, better functions based on the best-performing ones. In short, it\u2019s survival of the fittest. Bingham said, \u201cBy simulating survival of the fittest and genetic mutation, after a few generations of evolution we are able to discover dozens of new activation functions that are better than the ones machine learning practitioners typically use.\u201d Image Graduate student William Macke As they delved further into their research, the team found that the activation functions they developed through evolution were \u201coften quite complicated and unlikely to be discovered by humans\u201d and could increase a \u201cneural network\u2019s accuracy by a few percentage points.\u201d They also observed that rather than using the same activation function in every case, their evolution method discovered functions that were tailored for specific tasks, such as image classification or machine translation. Bingham is optimistic that their research can be a great asset to machine learning researchers, because \u201cinstead of spending months trying to discover ways to improve their AI systems, we can do it automatically using our algorithm.\u201d \u201cEvolutionary Optimization of Deep Learning Activation Functions\u201d will be presented in early July at the 2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference.

    "text_content": "Working Toward a More Accessible Future: Teaching Computers to Imitate Human Perception | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Working Toward a More Accessible Future: Teaching Computers to Imitate Human Perception Posted by Angelica Lopez on Thursday, April 11, 2019 Alex Huth (left), assistant professor of Neuroscience and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. Shailee Jain (right), a Computer Science PhD student at the Huth Lab. Imagine a world where accessing and interacting with technology doesn\u2019t require keyboard or voice input\u2014just a quick mental command. Imagine \u201cspeech prosthesis\u201d technology that would allow people who are unable to communicate verbally to speak without expensive and highly customized interfaces. Imagine a device that could read a users\u2019 mind, and automatically send a message, open a door, or buy a birthday present for a family member. This might sound like a distant reality, but research from Alexander Huth and Shailee Jain at Texas Computer Science suggest this future will soon be within reach. Huth and Jain are working toward this technology through research that predicts how the brain responds to language in context. In a paper presented at the 2018 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), Huth\u2019s team described the results of experiments that used artificial neural networks to predict with greater accuracy than ever before how different parts of the brain respond to specific words. Image Context length preference across cortex. An index of context length preference is computed for each voxel in one subject and projected onto that subject's cortical surface. Voxels shown in blue are best modeled using short context, while red voxels are best modeled with long context. Human perception is complicated, and training computers to imitate naturally occurring processes is challenging. \u201cAs words come into our heads, we form ideas of what someone is saying to us, and we want to understand how that comes to us inside the brain,\u201d Huth said. \u201cIt seems like there should be systems to it, but practically, that's just not how language works. Like anything in biology, it's very hard to reduce down to a simple set of equations.\u201d In their work, the researchers ran experiments to test, and ultimately predict, how different areas in the brain would respond when listening to stories. They used data collected from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines, which maps where language concepts are \u201crepresented\u201d in the brain. Using powerful supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, they then trained a language model so it could effectively predict what word the participants would think of next\u2014a task akin to Google autocomplete searches, which the human mind is particularly adept at. \u201cIn trying to predict the next word, this model has to implicitly learn all this other stuff about how language works,\u201d said Huth, \u201clike which words tend to follow other words, without ever actually accessing the brain or any data about the brain.\u201d Based on both the language model and fMRI data, they trained a system that could predict how the brain would respond when it hears each word in a new story for the first time. Past efforts had shown that it is possible to localize language responses in the brain effectively. However, the new research showed that adding contextual elements\u2014in this case, up to 20 words that came before\u2014improved brain activity predictions significantly. The more context provided, the better the accuracy of their predictions. Natural language processing\u2014or NLP\u2014has taken great strides in recent years. But when it comes to answering questions, having natural conversations, or analyzing the sentiments in written texts, the field still has a long way to go. The researchers believe their language model can help in these areas. Image Contextual language encoding model with narrative stimuli. Each word in the story is first projected into a 985-dimensional embedding space. Sequences of word representations are then fed into an LSTM network that was pre-trained as a language model. \u201cIf this works, then it's possible that this network could learn to read text or intake language similarly to how our brains do,\u201d Huth said. \u201cImagine Google Translate, but it understands what you're saying, instead of just learning a set of rules.\u201d With such a system in place, Huth believes it is only a matter of time until a mind-reading system that can translate brain activity into language is feasible. This system could have life-changing implications for people who aren\u2019t able to communicate verbally. According to Huth, resulting technology could one day provide \u201cspeech prosthesis\u201d for people who have lost the ability to speak as a result of injury or disease, as well as people with non-verbal forms of autism. This technology even might one day translate into a consumer brain-computer interface that could replace keyboard and voice input. \u201cIf the technology could be sufficiently miniaturized, we could imagine eventually replacing interfaces that require users to type on a keyboard or speak (like Siri) with direct brain communication\u201d said Huth. While other labs are also working toward this goal, Huth\u2019s research is especially innovative because his lab is exploring the brain using non-invasive techniques. \u201cOur research uses recording technology like the fMRI, which requires no brain surgery and can be performed on healthy volunteers\u201d said Huth. \u201cWhile we are more limited in the types of signals we can record, the potential benefit of our approach is larger.\u201d Regardless of what the future holds, it\u2019s clear that Huth and his team are conducting groundbreaking research that\u2019s both changing our understanding of natural language, and showcasing the power of AI to predict human perception.

    "text_content": "TXCS Student Deploys Website to Connect People to Combat COVID-19 | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TXCS Student Deploys Website to Connect People to Combat COVID-19 Posted by Spoorthi Krishnaraj on Monday, April 13, 2020 TXCS student Amir Mostafavi (left) and his friend Ali Ajam, the developers of kovid19.org As the number of COVID-19 infections rises and people remain in isolation, the streets have increasingly begun to look like scenes from doomsday movies. This is in stark contrast to grocery stores and other essential establishments, however, where people continue to congregate out of need for essential supplies. Although many stores have enforced restrictions such as limiting the number of customers allowed inside at a time, they still pose a significant risk. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory explicitly mentions grocery stores as places where social distancing measures become difficult to follow, possibly increasing transmission of the disease. The CDC also recommends that people at higher risk of severe illness, e.g., older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions, absolutely do not leave their homes. This has led to a number of health professionals advising that their at-risk patients have friends and relatives shop for them. Texas Computer Science ( TXCS ) senior Amir Mostafavi acutely felt the effects of this a couple of weeks ago. His grandmother, who lives in Dallas, called him and asked if he could buy her groceries. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know I was in Austin,\u201d explains Amir. \u201cI had to call one of my friends who was in Dallas to go help her out.\u201d It was this incident that gave him the idea of automating that process. \u201cSo that people who need help can sign up, people who are willing to give help can sign up as well, and then we can match them together,\u201d he says. Amir called his friend Ali Ajam to tell him about his idea, and they immediately got to work. After a day of brainstorming and two more days of developing, they deployed their website, kovid19.org . \u201cIt was like a three-day sprint,\u201d laughs Amir. At the moment, the website gives visitors the option to sign up to either offer or request help in any of three categories: grocery shopping, dog walking, and technical help. Visitors can then enter their name, phone number and zip code. \u201cAnd then on the back end, we match people who are in the same zip code and help category. The matching happens automatically,\u201d says Ali. \u201cEvery four hours, we run a function to check all the new data and generate pairs.\u201d Image kovid19.org helps volunteers get matched with people who need help in their respective vicinities Once a match is made, each person gets a confirmation text with details on how to contact their helper/requestor. \u201cThis is a part that's really important to us,\u201d says Amir. \u201cAt first our approach was to match these two people and then send them an email with both parties\u2019 contact information. But then we realized that this website is primarily aiming to help elderly people, and most of them don\u2019t have email addresses, so we decided to just do phone numbers.\u201d They took extensive measures to protect the privacy of their users. In Amir\u2019s words: \u201cWe didn't want to share any of the parties\u2019 phone numbers with each other for privacy reasons. So we have an intermediary number that all the texts go through, and on the back end, we figure out where to route them based on the pairs that we have. And then these two people can communicate through our phone number as much as they want.\u201d Users have the freedom to opt out as well. If someone wants to unmatch with a specific person, they can reply \u201c unmatch \u201d to the same phone number. The pair gets broken up, and the people are added back to the matchmaking process. And if someone wants to remove themselves from the system completely, they can reply with \u201cexit,\u201d which takes them out of the matchmaking process and the match that they already have. At the time that this article was written, kovid19.org had been active for two days and already had around 100 users signed up. \u201cI was checking through some of the zip codes that we have and they're from all over the place\u2014 New York, Texas, even Mississippi, Kansas,\u201d says Amir. Ali adds, \u201cBut more exciting than that is that 80% of those people signed up to provide help.\u201d The reactions they\u2019ve received from some of their close friends have been especially heartwarming for the two. \u201cI actually have a senior roommate, and he was so excited when I told him [about it]. People love the idea,\u201d says Ali. \u201cWe just need to find a good channel to spread the platform to let people know that it exists. And then hopefully it can be a good use for all of them.\u201d You can visit kovid19.org to try out the website.

Jenna Luecke/University of Texas at Austin. Computer scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have taught an artificial intelligence agent how to do something that usually only humans can do\u2014take a few quick glimpses around and infer its whole environment, a skill necessary for the development of effective search-and-rescue robots that one day can improve the effectiveness of dangerous missions. The team, led by professor Kristen Grauman , Ph.D. candidate Santhosh Ramakrishnan and former Ph.D. candidate Dinesh Jayaraman (now at the University of California, Berkeley) published their results today in the journal Science Robotics . Most AI agents\u2014computer systems that could endow robots or other machines with intelligence\u2014are trained for very specific tasks\u2014such as to recognize an object or estimate its volume\u2014in an environment they have experienced before, like a factory. But the agent developed by Grauman and Ramakrishnan is general purpose, gathering visual information that can then be used for a wide range of tasks. \"We want an agent that's generally equipped to enter environments and be ready for new perception tasks as they arise,\" Grauman said. \"It behaves in a way that's versatile and able to succeed at different tasks because it has learned useful patterns about the visual world.\" The scientists used deep learning, a type of machine learning inspired by the brain's neural networks, to train their agent on thousands of 360-degree images of different environments. Now, when presented with a scene it has never seen before, the agent uses its experience to choose a few glimpses\u2014like a tourist standing in the middle of a cathedral taking a few snapshots in different directions\u2014that together add up to less than 20 percent of the full scene. What makes this system so effective is that it's not just taking pictures in random directions but, after each glimpse, choosing the next shot that it predicts will add the most new information about the whole scene. This is much like if you were in a grocery store you had never visited before, and you saw apples, you would expect to find oranges nearby, but to locate the milk, you might glance the other way. Based on glimpses, the agent infers what it would have seen if it had looked in all the other directions, reconstructing a full 360-degree image of its surroundings. \"Just as you bring in prior information about the regularities that exist in previously experienced environments\u2014like all the grocery stores you have ever been to\u2014this agent searches in a nonexhaustive way,\" Grauman said. \"It learns to make intelligent guesses about where to gather visual information to succeed in perception tasks.\" Image A new AI agent developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin takes a few \"glimpses\" of its surroundings, representing less than 20 percent of the full 360 degree view, and infers the rest of the whole environment. What makes this system so effective is that it\u2019s not just taking pictures in random directions but, after each glimpse, choosing the next shot that it predicts will add the most new information about the whole scene. Credit to David Steadman/Santhosh Ramakrishnan/University of Texas at Austin. One of the main challenges the scientists set for themselves was to design an agent that can work under tight time constraints. This would be critical in a search-and-rescue application. For example, in a burning building a robot would be called upon to quickly locate people, flames and hazardous materials and relay that information to firefighters. For now, the new agent operates like a person standing in one spot, with the ability to point a camera in any direction but not able to move to a new position. Or, equivalently, the agent could gaze upon an object it is holding and decide how to turn the object to inspect another side of it. Next, the researchers are developing the system further to work in a fully mobile robot. Using the supercomputers at UT Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center and Department of Computer Science, it took about a day to train their agent using an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The team, with Ramakrishnan's leadership, developed a method for speeding up the training : building a second agent, called a sidekick, to assist the primary agent. \"Using extra information that's present purely during training helps the [primary] agent learn faster,\" Ramakrishnan said. This research was supported, in part, by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, IBM Corp. and Sony Corp.

But what many remember best about the movie is HAL 9000, the murderous artificial intelligence aboard the spaceship that has been ranked cinema's 13 th best villain. As one of fiction's most famous AI agents turns 50, we sat down with artificial intelligence expert and assistant professor of computer science Scott Niekum to find out how well the film holds up to the real thing. The conversation below has been edited for space. When I think of artificial intelligence, HAL 9000 is one of the first things I think of. Is that a problem? I think AI definitely has a PR problem in some ways. The first thing people think of is the Terminator or Hal 9000\u2014rather than Baymax from \"Big Hero 6.\" I'm actually really glad that film got made because it does present this really hopeful future for AI and robots helping humanity. There are always doomsayers about any new technology, but AI is something that is particularly scary to a lot of people because the public perception is inaccurate. People think what AI and machine learning researchers are doing is recreating human intelligence and deploying it onto problems, and that's not what is happening. Let's set the record straight. What is AI really? At least right now in AI, we are not recreating some generalized intelligence that we just apply to a whole lot of problems. What we do is we build algorithms that are targeted to one very specific problem and that is the only thing they do, like controlling an elevator, for example. A system like HAL 9000 or the Terminator can only exist and be dangerous if it's a general intelligence that can do and learn anything. In the elevator-control example, it can learn how to be better at its job, but it can't learn about the outside world. It's simply not capable of that. And, it's important to remember, there is a lot of work happening right now in machine learning that is based around safety. We want to make sure that when systems are self-improving they are not going to do something that is either incorrect or dangerous. Early on in the film, HAL states that he is foolproof and incapable of error. Can an AI ever be totally foolproof? It depends on how you define foolproof and error. One example that people talk about a lot now is self-driving cars. We would love to have self-driving cars that will never be in an accident. But that can't happen. You can't prevent a deer from jumping on top of the car. There are factors in the real world that you just can't control. We can't individually control every element of the world. We can really only optimize, not become perfect. \u2026 One thing that I'm working on currently with one of my students, Daniel Brown, is this idea that, if we want to get robots out in the world in people's homes and workplaces, we can't have an expert like me or one of my students program them for every home they'd be in. It would be great if we could stick a robot out there, and the robot could just watch someone do something once or twice and now it knows how to do that thing. We work on building algorithms that can do that. But what does it mean to get the gist of something? If I show a couple of demonstrations of a task to the robot, what would it take for it to be able to say, \"OK, I've seen enough demos. I get what you're showing me,\" or \"I think I need a few more.\" It really gets at the heart of what it means to understand something. Is it important to put constraints around AI? For example, it seems like HAL was able to lie, manipulate and preserve itself over people. Maybe the programmers could have prevented that? People are worried about AI being designed poorly and getting out of control, but if you design a bridge poorly, it's also going to get out of control. This happens across all engineering, and I don't see AI as any different. Because it involves these processes, like learning, that are easily anthropomorphized, we project all kinds of human things on AI. It's not just lay people. This is a big problem in science, too. When a system performs well or performs in a certain way, it's super easy for us as scientists to project things like understanding on to it, when sometimes there is a much simpler explanation. In the film, when Dave, the mission commander, goes to deactivate HAL, the AI pleads with him not to deactivate, saying, \"I'm afraid, Dave.\" What are the ethics of destroying something that has expressed an emotion? It's not alive. It's not human. It doesn't have biological drives or emotions like we do. We still have a very poor understanding of consciousness, but we still don't have AI systems, in my opinion, that are as intelligent as even ants. In robotics, we can't reliably pick up a can of Coke. Even if it is easy to anthropomorphize, even if they do become more intelligent, they are just built systems. I don't think there is any ethical problem there. HAL was, according to the film, born in 1992. Remembering my first Apple Macintosh that I had in 1992, I'm guessing we were not anywhere near that capability at that time. Is something even remotely like HAL possible now, or how far off are we? I think the closest thing we have to HAL right now are personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. If you've used them, you know they are OK . They are not ideal. They're not going to be running a spaceship any time soon. People are very afraid of AI and yet it is all around us in ways that have become semitransparent, like Google Maps, and people aren't freaked out about those. The more commonplace things become that are AI, they stop being called AI. The definition of AI just keeps getting pushed back. How realistic is an agent like HAL? In principle, there is nothing preventing the creation of human-level intelligence in a computer. But would it behave that way? Not if it was engineered well. There's all sorts of good questions to ask about AI\u2014Is it going to be used ethically in warfare, for example?\u2014but those questions are mostly about how humans are going to use AI, rather than the technology taking off and doing something dangerous on its own. What's the most realistic depiction of AI that you've seen in pop culture or film? I felt like \"Her\" was actually quite good. It wasn't a robot or an incarnated thing, it was just this Siri-like thing, but to the next level, and it didn't seem so ridiculous. A much further looking thing, but something where I thought they didn't screw up everything was \"Westworld.\" They did a pretty reasonable job at depicting what future intelligent, self-preserving-but-restricted agents might look like. There are basically just a bunch of knobs you can turn to adjust agent aggression and intelligence, and you know when you turn the knob the wrong way bad things happen. I thought that was a reasonable depiction, but one that is very far in the future and not resembling at all what things are like now or where they necessarily are going to go.

BeVote is a free cellphone app designed exclusively for UT students that provides accurate, nonpartisan information and was programmed by UT students. The app is designed not only to enhance the voting experience but also to actively inform university students to become voters. Computer science students Morgan Lawless and Robert McInvale developed the application, working with the Simulation and Game Applications Lab , led by computer science faculty member Paul Toprac . The iOS version is available at the Apple App Store now. The Android version is scheduled for release on Friday, Nov. 2. BeVote brings information to Longhorns' fingertips, such as: Candidates and propositions Custom, downloadable ballots Push notifications for early and Election Day voting Map of Travis County polling stations for early and Election Day voting, with wait times Social media links Image It was an old-fashioned phone call that led to this Digital Age innovation that could inspire the next generation of voters. Last spring, Hannah Wojciehowski, a professor of English in the College of Liberal Arts, and Paul Toprac of the College of Natural Sciences dialed Susan Nold, director of the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life, to brainstorm possibilities. That conversation sparked a cross-campus collaboration that has produced the free cellphone app. \"We worked to make something that was functional and helpful to students,\" said Toprac, an associate professor of instruction in the Department of Computer Science. \"After the election, we will continue to develop it and hopefully make it even bigger and better for the future.\" After the initial brainstorming session, Toprac worked with Kassie Barroquillo of the Strauss Institute to understand what research and data indicated about why students were not voting. The team also used a bottom-up approach, talking to students directly on campus. With user information in hand, Toprac enlisted a group of students to work on design and programming. In addition to Lawless and McInvale, School of Information graduate student Mona Mishra and Kathy Vong from the College of Fine Arts sketched out the app's design. BeVote is sponsored by the College of Liberal Arts, the SAGA Lab, the Moody College of Communication, the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life, University of Texas Libraries, the Cockrell School of Engineering, the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, TX Votes and UT Student Government.

On Thursday, June 21, UT Austin Villa faced Brazilian team BahiaRT in the 3D Simulation League semifinals and won 6-0, then played against and defeated magmaOffenburg from the Offenburg University of Applied Sciences to win the world championship for the fifth year in a row. During this year\u2019s RoboCup competition, the UT Austin Villa 3D Simulation League team won all 23 games they played, scoring a total of 139 goals without letting any opposing team score once. This year\u2019s team consists of Ph.D. student Faraz Torabi , computer science senior Brahma Pavse and electrical engineering senior John Sigmon and is led by postdoctoral fellow Patrick MacAlpine and Professor Peter Stone . In the RoboCup simulation leagues , teams of software agents, or programs that simulate robots, play against each other in a two- or three-dimensional computer environment that mimics the rules and physics of a soccer game in the real world. The goal of the simulation leagues is to program the simulated robots to behave strategically while playing the game and, specifically in the 3D Simulation League , create the humanoid robots\u2019 basic behaviors such as walking, kicking, turning and standing up. Image Peter Stone (left) and Patrick MacAlpine (right) accept the 1st place trophy for the 3D Simulation League at RoboCup 2018, held in Montreal, Canada. UT Austin Villa has won seven out of the past eight 3D Simulation League championships and placed second in 2013. Over the past eight years, the team has won 147 games, lost three times and tied six times, with a total of 779 goals scored and only seven scored against them by the opposing team. This year, the league has become more competitive: FCPortugal , magmaOffenburg\u2019s opponent in the semifinals, unveiled a new kickoff set play that is difficult to stop, and magmaOffenburg revealed a new faster walk that prevented UT Austin Villa\u2019s kickoff set play from working. However, UT Austin Villa has also improved to face the increased competition; the team trained a deep neural network to figure out where to pass the ball, added new variable distance fast walk kicks, and optimized the goalie\u2019s diving behaviors.

    "text_content": "Changing the Future of Gene-Editing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Changing the Future of Gene-Editing Posted by Tracy Zhang on Wednesday, March 6, 2019 A merged multi-scale structurally valid visualization of the ribosome; the green volume occupying model and the tertiary and secondary structural model is obtained from reconstructed single particle cryo-electron microscopy, while the atomic-resolution structures is from X-ray crystallography resolved models. Gene-editing or genome engineering is the altering of DNA within a living organism. Once believed to be far-fetched and unthinkable, it is becoming more and more common due to scientific breakthrough techniques like CRISPR. What most people don\u2019t know though is the use of computing tools in conjunction with CRISPR make gene-editing as efficient and mistake-free as possible\u2014making it a viable cure to deadly genetic diseases. Since its initial discovery in the late 90s, scientists have been studying CRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats of DNA inside bacteria. They found that bacteria protect themselves from viruses by using a protein called Cas9 which is guided by the CRISPR sequence to remove corrupted or viral DNA. Today, scientists have gained enough understanding to develop CRISPR in labs and manipulate it to edit the genes of a variety of organisms. It is a powerful tool that many see as a potential cure to serious genetic diseases such as cancer, HIV, and Huntington\u2019s disease. With the ability to target and edit highly specific segments of DNA, CRISPR is essentially able to tackle sickness right at its roots. Theoretically, gene-editing should behave like the autocorrect feature of many word processors, replacing problematic genes with healthy ones in the way that typos are corrected. However, this process is highly complex and oftentimes imperfect. CRISPR-Cas9 molecules may sometimes target the wrong genes, replacing healthy segments of DNA with those that do not belong there. As Texas Computer Science and Integrative Biology Professor William Press says, \u201cthe Cas9 molecule finds a place and binds, but this is only useful if it\u2019s the only place to bind\u201d. In other words, the Cas9 molecule can be unpredictable and when the stakes in gene-editing are this high, making a single mistake could lead to undoable, catastrophic, and even life-threatening results. Image An artistic visualization and modeled snapshot of an infected molecular bacterial cell; visualized are strands of RNA and micro-RNA being translated by poly-ribosomes. The pineapple shaped are parasitic bacterial phages Phi29, that have infected the cell. Computer scientists at UT are working hard to change this. They have developed a way to understand the kind of errors that CRISPR might make. This method, called the Chip Hybridized Affinity Mapping Platform ( CHAMP ) directly measures which genomes and DNA segments CRISPR will interact with. At its core, it is a genome sequencing chip. According to Press, \u201cbefore CHAMP, finding binding sites was all guesswork\u2014you would have to try each binding site experimentally in the lab, one at a time, each one oftentimes a full day of work...but with CHAMP\u2014you can easily test a million matches at a time.\u201d The whole project is open source, from the designs for a 3-D printed mount that holds the chip under a microscope to the software that the team developed for analyzing collected data. As a result, other scientists and researchers can easily replicate and further build upon this revolutionary technique. Press says CHAMP provides an experimental and computational pipeline that will enable the important next step: to implement a machine learning approach in which examples of true bindings and off-target bindings are provided to a computer to generalize underlying patterns. Future systems will then be predictive, requiring the CHAMP pipeline only for experimental confirmation. Even so, identifying bacterial CRISPR sequences with their associated Cas9 like nucleases is one peice of the broader gene-editing puzzle. It is now also possible to design and synthesize short RNA molecules to match specific DNA sequences. These molecules can then guide nucleases and enzymes such as CAS9 to an intended DNA target similar to CRISPR-Cas9 machinery. \u201cYou need to design and create the right RNA for the identified gene sequence you need to edit, and also identify the RNA binding proteins and nucleases that perform the editing\u201d says, Texas Computer Science Professor and Director of the Center for Computational Visualization Chandrajit Bajaj . Bajaj works on the molecular modeling and recognition aspects of the problem, creating tools for determining structure and function models from molecular imaging, molecular docking, and drug discovery. It turns out, in this area, computers can be used again to simulate and test a multitude of designer RNA models and binding proteins for specific DNA binding sites. \u201cJust as in drug discovery, the search is for the best guide RNA and nucleases that bind and edit DNA sequences with specificity\u201d, says Bajaj. Further, \u201cCan these be synthesized? What are associated nuclease enzymes that can facilitate this DNA binding and gene-editing? Can these also be safely delivered into the body?\u201d These are some of the many questions that must be asked and answered to realize the full potential of using CRISPR and other CRISPR inspired technologies to combat human diseases. Utilizing computing to simulate binding affinity and optimal molecular recognition are design optimization and machine learning problems just as much as they are biological ones. To take the guesswork out of CRISPR or designing CRISPR-Cas9 like molecular machinery for gene-editing is an extremely powerful thing\u2014especially when the whole process is ultimately used to remedy currently incurable illnesses. Humans just simply cannot work through all the possibilities and today\u2019s data-driven techniques using machine learning, computational modeling, and simulation are the key enablers to making gene-editing as safe and mistake-free as possible. These tools will continue to empower computer and biological scientists alike to revolutionize the future treatment of genetic diseases.

    "text_content": "Peter Stone Interviewed About Future of Self-Driving Cars | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Peter Stone Interviewed About Future of Self-Driving Cars Posted by Julianne Hodges on Thursday, September 22, 2016 By David Holley, Xconomy Science, technology and business news website Xconomy interviewed UTCS professor Peter Stone about the opportunities and the potential challenges for self-driving cars. Stone is part of AI100 , a project hosted by Stanford University exploring the ethics of developing artificial intelligence technologies. Autonomous vehicles are one of the most buzzed-about segments of artificial intelligence right now, with big investments in their research and development. Automakers from Ford to Delphi are pushing forward with promises to release fleets of driverless automobiles. Toyota is building research hubs for self-driving vehicles. Others are considering the impact it could have on industries like trucking. Stone spoke with Xconomy during what has been a busy week for self-driving cars. The federal government released its first guidelines on the sector, providing 15 points on design and development safety, as well as plans for how to review future regulations, among other details. Meanwhile, the co-founder and president of Lyft, John Zimmer, predicted that most cars will be autonomous in five years and that car ownership will dwindle after that. Image Peter Stone sits in the passenger seat of Marvin the autonomous car. Xconomy: With the first reports of deaths related to semi-autonomous car crashes, what are your thoughts? Peter Stone: At the highest level of context, it\u2019s inevitable that as we transition to autonomous cars that there will be accidents. It\u2019s also inevitable that the first one that happened will get a lot of attention. If people are able to keep their eye on the big picture, and notice that there\u2019s something like 33,000 traffic fatalities in the U.S. every year\u2014most of those don\u2019t even make the news because they\u2019re so commonplace. That\u2019s with human-driven cars. The burden of proof shouldn\u2019t be perfection. The standard shouldn\u2019t be perfection. The standard should be better than people. It\u2019ll become clear pretty quickly that autonomous cars are going to overall be a good thing. X: Where are we in reaching that better-than-human goal? PS: It\u2019s hard for me to quantify sitting from where I am. I\u2019m fairly confident that, if we could wave a magic wand and make all the cars on the road autonomous right now, and replace all the human drivers on the road, we would instantly have much safer roadways. Even right now, using current autonomous car technologies. Some of the technology we use is still more expensive than it can be to have it widely deployed and affordable. X: What\u2019s preventing that? PS: The first demonstrations of autonomous cars were in the late \u201980s. By 2007, there was the DARPA Urban Challenge; I had a car there. There were cars there that were fairly reliable, though they hadn\u2019t been tested on millions of miles like the Google car has been now. From that, we can have a lot of confidence that the technology is there. The barriers now are cost, confidence in the technology on the part of the general public, and also the legislation and insurance issues that have to be solved. X: What are your thoughts about the federal policies announced this week? PS: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the AI100 report. We had a whole section on transportation and on policy. One of the top recommendations is that there needs to be flexibility in regulations. If there are regulations, you need to do it on a sector-by-sector basis. It\u2019s a good thing that technology is being considered not as AI being one thing, but rather this being AI technologies in autonomous cars. From what I saw, they\u2019re leaving open explicitly the need to revisit guidelines every year and with technology experts fully in the loop. That\u2019s a good sign. X: The camera in my car sometimes doesn\u2019t work when I pull up to something like a gate, to let me know I\u2019m getting too close. Is that consumer confidence issue a big barrier to cross? PS: There\u2019s the confidence issue and the technical reliability issue. The camera in your car is probably not the state of the art sensor. The algorithm behind it is probably not the state of the art algorithm. It\u2019s probably also not being trusted to drive your car. The technology needs to be the best we can make it, but there\u2019s also tradeoffs with costs. If we put a high-fidelity Lidar there in place of your camera, I can tell you it wouldn\u2019t make any mistakes at all. But it would also be much more expensive. There\u2019s going to be a trust issue. You don\u2019t trust it. But once you start driving in a car that starts making decisions reliably, you will start trusting it. In the same way, I have a 16-year-old son who is driving on the road. At first, I didn\u2019t trust him. Gradually, I\u2019ve watched him drive and he\u2019s taking a driving course. He\u2019s been tested now and certified. Gradually, I and other people on the road start trusting him as a driver that\u2019s going to do mainly predictable things. I think that\u2019ll happen with autonomous cars as well. X: Do you have any take on when we\u2019ll see more autonomous cars being on the road? PS: I\u2019m not going to put my finger on a year. The technology is already here. It\u2019s a matter of the legal, the policy, the social, and the cost. I can\u2019t predict how long that will take. Once there are autonomous cars on the market at an affordable price, no one will buy any other type of car again, in the same way that once high-definition televisions were on the market, that took over the market instantly. X: Do you think it will come sooner than later? PS: Car companies are pushing toward it, and once there is a car on the market, that\u2019s what people will buy. X: What are your thoughts if an AI system has to make a moral decision? PS: We also call this out as an issue in the AI100 report. But I don\u2019t have much to say about it personally. Ultimately, we\u2019ll need to decide as a society what the \u201ccorrect\u201d decision is in such situations. X: Do you think overall car sales will drop once autonomous cars sales become more dominant? Lyft\u2019s president says he thinks people will only use ridesharing services when autonomous cars take over the market (which may not be a surprising remark). PS: Yes, I think it\u2019s quite plausible that autonomous cars will make carsharing sensible to many people. I\u2019m not sure if everyone will accept it. But if the price is right, I suspect many will. News Categories Faculty Research Tags Artificial Intelligence autonomous car Peter Stone",

    "text_content": "Professor Etienne Vouga Uses Complex Geometry to Solve Real-World Problems | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor Etienne Vouga Uses Complex Geometry to Solve Real-World Problems Posted by Julianne Hodges on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 The world is made up of shapes of all kinds, from boxy cubes to perfect spheres and everything in between. Some shapes work best for certain applications; for example, only a few configurations will lead to a stable building. Computer science assistant professor Etienne Vouga \u2019s research in physical simulation and geometry processing takes these complex shapes, turns them into a simpler type of geometry that a computer can understand, then uses computer algorithms to improve real-world applications such as architecture and 3D printing. In order to allow computers to simulate these systems, the smooth, continuous geometry of the real world must be approximated by breaking the curves and surfaces into a finite amount of points. \u201cGeometry in the real world is extremely complex: there\u2019s lots of details in geometry, there\u2019s lots of sharp features and small details,\u201d Vouga said. \u201cIf you try to create a computer algorithm that deals with real-world geometry, it just isn\u2019t tractable, there\u2019s just too much data and too much complexity.\u201d For example, in order to simulate a perfect sphere with infinitely many points on a computer, it must be approximated as a polyhedron, or many-sided object, with its smooth curves broken up by an amount of points that the computer can handle. However, many formulas in math and physics require the geometry to be smooth and won't work if you try to apply them directly to discrete, or \u201cchunky,\u201d objects. Researchers such as Vouga study new formulas that can handle this discontinuous geometry, called discrete differential geometry. Image Surfaces with irregularly placed holes are hard to realize as masonry, where the mortar between bricks must not be subject to tensile stresses. The surface shown here, surprisingly, has this property \u2013 it has been found as the nearest self-supporting shape from a given freeform geometry. The fictitious thrust network used in our algorithms is superimposed, with edges\u2019 cross-section and coloring visualizing the magnitude of forces (warmer colors represent higher stresses.) Image Curvature analysis with respect to the Airy stress surface tells us how to remesh shapes by self-supporting quad meshes with planar faces. This guides steel/glass constructions with low moments in nodes. A major challenge is making sure that any formulas or mathematical descriptions of the approximated object reflect reality. Sometimes, according to Vouga, formulas that approximate real-world objects can break down as more detail is added to a computer simulation. However, there\u2019s a trade-off to more detailed approximations: more accuracy costs more computational resources. The key is to balance an accurate representation of the object with using less information and processing power, Vouga said. \u201cYou want to have this knob that you can tune so that the more (computational resources) budget you can allow, the better your answer gets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hallmark of a good algorithm in discrete differential geometry is that this knob is in place and works correctly.\u201d In the past, Vouga and his fellow researchers have used discrete differential geometry to turn the physics of buildings into algorithms that can predict what building shapes will and won\u2019t hold up. By simplifying the geometry, computers can handle the formulas in a shorter amount of time, allowing these algorithms to be used in software programs that architects can use to try out different shapes and understand how they would work in the real world. For example, skyscrapers are most commonly built with concrete strengthened by steel reinforcing bars, but architects want building techniques that don\u2019t use these materials, according to Vouga. After about a century, the steel begins to corrode within the concrete and the building becomes less stable. Buildings made from other materials, such as stone or glass, would last longer and cost less to construct, Vouga said. \u201cFor these kinds of buildings, the algorithm I\u2019ve designed can be used to figure out what geometries are possible and what geometries are not possible for constructing these things,\u201d he said. More recently, Vouga has been working on applying geometry processing to 3D printing. He has worked with UT\u2019s Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences to investigate designing 3D-printed mechanical objects, such as an analog clock, that actually work. Uncertainty from the process of 3D printing, even under the best circumstances, creates challenges when printing complex objects. \u201cYou\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019re going to get out of the 3D printer,\u201d Vouga said. \u201cSmall variations can cause large changes in the behavior of the object you\u2019re trying to build. If your gear is slightly too bumpy or if it\u2019s slightly too fat, it won\u2019t turn anymore (because) there will be too much friction between the gears.\u201d In order to compensate for these effects, the researchers are working on algorithms that make it less likely that the resulting objects will not fit together. The algorithms must understand the design and the function of the object, then use this information to predict any errors the 3D printer will make and adjust the shape of the object that will be printed. Image The torus is an especially challenging case - it is much easier to make collapsible origami that models an object with holes or boundaries (since the paper has more freedom to bend and fold at the boundaries) than it is an object that is completely without holes/edges, like the torus. Image The Miura origami pattern is flexible and rigid-foldable - pressing on it causes it to collapse and fold up. By analyzing the geometry of arbitrary curved shapes, it is possible to construct new origami patterns that realize collapsible and deployable versions of those shapes. His most recent research , published last October, explores reverse-engineering and mimicking the growth of complicated-looking biological objects, such as leaves and flowers, from simple shapes. Since 3D printers can\u2019t print thin objects accurately, the researchers came up with a technique using the mathematics of biological growth to create a 3D object out of two dimensions using plastics that swell or shrink at different rates when heated. This could lead to objects that change shape in response to surrounding conditions and robotics that can move without motors. Just like finding the best shape for a building, both of these problems rely on understanding and optimizing the geometry of a needed shape. Vouga said these solutions will start to let 3D printing overcome its limitations and live up to some of people\u2019s expectations. \u201cThey tell you that you\u2019ll be able to 3D-print anything that you want at home and you won\u2019t ever need to go to the store again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is nonsense, there\u2019s only a certain amount of practical objects that you can actually 3D-print.\u201d Vouga said that understanding geometry is important to comprehending and recreating the behavior of important processes, such as leaf growth and building stability. \u201cAlthough these sound like very different questions about very different topics, at the heart of all of these is the relationship between geometry and function,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can understand geometry, and compute with it, we can better understand and predict the physics of the natural world.\u201d News Categories Faculty Research Tags Etienne Vouga Graphics and Visualization physical simulation geometry processing",

Inspired by campus-wide education initiatives meant to disrupt traditional three-hour credit models, the microcredit is a one-hour credit course that lasts five weeks and is taught by an industry professional. One-hour courses such as Introduction to Integrated Design and Sketching for Thinking and Communication, offer students an opportunity to learn a methodology that teaches critical thinking, autonomous problem solving and team dynamics through an iterative, human-centered approach. A 19-credit transcriptable certificate program offered by the CID and the Bridging Disciplines Program will soon be available to all undergraduate students and taught by working professionals. The College of Fine Arts hired Doreen Lorenzo, a design industry veteran and successful leader of global creative firms for more than two decades, to create the CID in spring 2016 to enable all UT students to discover design thinking as an interdisciplinary, human-centered approach to solving complex problems. \u201cSince we founded the CID, students from across the university have approached me expressing great interest in the program and how design thinking could be applied within their particular area of study,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cOur new microcredit courses taught by working professional faculty provide undergraduate and graduate students with more options to integrate diverse CID offerings in their existing coursework.\u201d In addition to the microcredit program, the CID is unveiling a public seminar series to explore the future of design in Austin and beyond. Beginning in March, the monthly seminars will host design leaders from around the world to meet with UT faculty members and students and members of Austin\u2019s business and design communities. The seminars will focus on how design thinking is being applied in diverse fields such as health care, business, engineering and emerging technology like artificial intelligence. The spring 2017 course offerings include three new one-hour microcredit courses: Introduction to Integrated Design, Sketching for Thinking and Communication, and Portfolio Critique. The CID will continue to offer its foundational three-hour course, Introduction to Design Thinking, which completed its first class of students in the fall 2016 semester. The CID is also in the early stages of developing a graduate-level Design Thinking portfolio program as well as an Executive Education program. The CID is collaborating with the Design Division in the Department of Art and Art History, the Cockrell School of Engineering, the School of Information, the Department of Textiles and Apparel, the McCombs School of Business, the Department of Computer Science and the School of Architecture programs to create a multidisciplinary curriculum that allows UT students the opportunity to study design methodology and apply it in creative and entrepreneurial scenarios. \u201cAs a mechanical engineering student, I recognized the need for more coursework in design. I jumped on the opportunity to learn from Doreen and round out my academic experience at UT before graduating,\u201d said Peter Lin, a UT Austin senior. \u201cIt\u2019s been inspiring, and as a result, I\u2019m considering a master\u2019s in design.\u201d For more information, contact: Alicia Dietrich , College of Fine Arts, 512-475-7033.

    "text_content": "Computer Science Students Win Best Paper Award | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science Students Win Best Paper Award Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, July 31, 2017 Image By printing this bunny in two pieces, the need for printing and later removing support structures has been eliminated. Two undergraduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and their faculty co-authors have won a best paper award from the Association for Computing Machinery. They presented their paper, which focuses on making 3D printing more efficient, at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference on July 18. Their paper was one of two nominated in the Real World Applications category. Eric Yu and Jinseok Yeom, students in UT Austin's Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), set out to solve a problem with one of the most popular and affordable types of 3D printers. FRI offers first- and second-year students in UT Austin's College of Natural Sciences the opportunity to engage in authentic research experiences while being supported and mentored by faculty and graduate students. These printers, which cost just a few hundred dollars, use a technology called fused deposition modelling (FDM), in which objects are built up layer by layer by heating plastic filaments. This allows you to build almost any small object you can imagine: a birdhouse, a statue of Abraham Lincoln, a bunny rabbit. But these printers have a big drawback: any part of the object that hangs out away from the rest, say a bunny's ears, tends to sag before the plastic cools and stiffens. Image Eric Yu holds the best paper award, which he and his co-authors won at GECCO 2017. One way around this sagging is to also build support structures under anything that juts out, like columns holding up a porch roof. But this means a lot of wasted material and extra time cutting off the supports and sanding down the finished object. Yu, Yeom and their co-authors took a different approach. They realized that if you sliced the object into two or more pieces, each piece could be built with a minimum of overhangs. For example, you could slice a bunny up so that the ears are printed pointing straight up or lying flat. Then the separate pieces could be glued together to make the final object\u2014with little to no support material to remove and much less sanding and polishing of the final object. The question then becomes, how do you optimize the \"decomposition\" of the object\u2014in other words, how can you cut up the object with the fewest pieces and the least volume of support structures? That's the research problem that Cem Tutum , the research educator for the Computational Design research stream of the FRI, assigned to Yu and Yeom. The students spent a year designing software that, for a given 3D shape, uses an evolutionary process to generate many different decompositions\u2014or ways to divide up the object for printing\u2014and then test them to find an optimal solution. Their algorithm, which takes about 10 to 20 minutes to run on a desktop PC, tests hundreds of thousands of possible decompositions and then returns an optimal solution. Users don't have to actually print prototypes to test, they can do all the testing virtually. The other co-authors on the paper, titled Evolutionary Decomposition for 3D Printing , are faculty members Etienne Vouga and Risto Miikkulainen .

Posted by Julianne Hodges on Tuesday, April 10, 2018 By Pallab Ghosh, BBC News Researchers in Texas are developing robots that have minds of their own. The scientists are creating systems that can learn for themselves and be able to operate in the home, the workplace and even on the sports field. Image The University of Texas, Austin team is incorporating artificial intelligence into its machines so that they can deal with real-world situations. Among the systems are automated assistants that will carry out simple tasks in a working office. Science fiction films predicted that in the future we would have intelligent robots. In the Day the Earth Stood Still, we had the sinister Gort; in Forbidden Planet there was Robby; and in the TV series Lost In Space it was Zachary Smith's nemesis, the Robot. It's been more than 50 years since those fictional representations - so where are they? Although we have had robots in factories for decades, getting them to leave the shop-floor has been no easy task. In manufacturing plants, they carry out pre-ordained, repetitive tasks all day and night. But if they step outside, they are unable to deal with the chaos of the real world. It is a place where order and routine are gone. Even the simplest of tasks are complicated by the unpredictability and vagueness of human interaction. A team at the University of Texas, Austin has set itself the challenge of bringing robots out of their comfort zone and into our messy world. Laptops on motorised pedestals wander eerily through the lab like slow, partly built Daleks. They are the researchers' Building Wide Intelligence Project. Currently, they are learning their way around the place. So far they have learned how to avoid bumping into stuff. But great things are planned for them. The aim is for them to be able to carry out simple instructions, like finding a colleague or locating and bringing over a piece of equipment. But that is easier said than done. They need to be able to recognise objects and people. They also need to understand rather than recognise human speech. There is a difference. The later involves having a limited number of voice commands pre-programmed into them. But understanding requires context and meaning. This can only be achieved using AI techniques, which involve the robot asking questions to help it understand what words mean. The researcher leading the project is a linguist, Dr Jesse Thomason. He has restricted the number of questions the partly built Daleks can ask to just five. Why so few? He tells me that the robots can become \"infuriating\" with their questions. They would ask them forever like a small child. Top team Indeed, when Jesse teaches one of the robots it seems like he is talking to a baby. His colleague, Dr Andrea Thomaz, is trying to teach human etiquette to the Daleks. She wants them to know when it is appropriate to approach a human and start up a conversation. Dr Thomaz has developed code to enable the robots to give out social cues, such as waving at someone, and then to look for movements or expressions from their human counterparts that indicate that they are happy to talk. \"The problem really is that robots have to be able to deal with the dynamics and noise and unpredictability that people bring into the environment, and so we have to think about perception, control and learning to build robots that can deal with that sort of thing,\" she told BBC News. In another part of the lab, humanoid robots are playing football. They are part of an international \"RoboCup\" initiative, which has set itself the challenge of building a team capable of beating the men's World Cup winners by 2050. The robots play on a mini indoor football pitch, working together as a team and learning from each match. Tiki-taka robots Playing football is far harder for machine-learning systems than chess or go, according to Prof Peter Stone who leads this project and plays football regularly himself. \"Rather than turn-taking, you have everyone moving at the same time. And if you take too long to decide what to do when you pass the ball, your opponents come and take the ball from you. \"It's also continuous. There are no discrete places where people need to be. They are always moving, through the air and through space. \"So there are many challenges in contrast to some of the board games.\" The kinds of robots in 1950s films are still in the realms of science fiction. But with rapid strides in artificial intelligence, it won't be long before they become part of our every day lives. Read this article on BBC News .

Image On March 19, computer systems researchers from across academics and industry gathered at the Gates-Dell Complex to discuss their products and research. Industry researchers and software engineers from Systems Research Consortium partners Google, Microsoft, VMware , and Huawei discussed topics such as data processing infrastructure and public clouds. UTCS professors and Systems Research Consortium faculty members Vijay Chidambaram , Emmett Witchel , Chris Rossbach , and Simon Peter discussed their research, which includes topics such as protecting secret data while it is being processed by untrusted services and how system software is affected by Moore\u2019s Law, or the trend where the density of transistors that can be placed on computer chips increases over time. Then on April 12, researchers from companies involved in robotics visited the GDC for the UT Robotics Consortium Symposium. Engineers and researchers from Robotics Consortium industry partners Omnicell , Arm , Sandia National Laboratories , and Orbotech presented their robotics products and research in areas such as autonomous systems and national security. Professors Ashish Deshpande and Mitch Pryor and graduate student Christina Petlowany from the UT mechanical engineering department and UTCS professor Scott Niekum shared their research, which includes using robots in places from the home and workplace to hazardous nuclear environments.

Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, August 14, 2017 Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) changed the world by supporting research from black holes to cures for cancer. Now, TACC introduces its most powerful supercomputer to date \u2014 Stampede2! What discoveries will it bring? Supercomputers solve problems and accelerate discovery in a way that traditional experiments cannot. These massive machines help researchers explore problems that are too vast (like black holes), too small (like DNA) and too dangerous (like hurricanes). For more than a decade UT Austin\u2019s Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) has led the academic world in supercomputing, continually pushing the envelope in power and speed. In 2013, TACC deployed the first Stampede supercomputer . During its five years of operations, Stampede helped tens of thousands of researchers nationwide complete more than 8 million successful computing jobs and clocked more than 3 billion core hours of computation. Through its five-year life cycle Stampede was continually ranked by the Top500 organization as one of the world's top 10 most powerful computing systems. It remained in the top 20 up to this year, when it was retired from operations. Image The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) used some of the world's most precise optics that manipulated laser light to first detect gravitational waves. The Stampede project provided both computation and consulting to help optimize the software used to analyze the raw data. Photo courtesy of LIGO. \"Stampede was an excellent tool for improving our understanding of the universe we live in. From the smallest scale of subatomic particles to detecting gravitational waves that have traveled a million light-years to the Earth, and a lot of exciting science and engineering in between,\" said Stuart Anderson , a research manager for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) based at the California Institute of Technology. The 2015 discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO is one of the most important discoveries in modern science. TACC and Stampede were there as part of the team, and this is just one example of the more than 11,000 researchers who used Stampede1 to accelerate discovery. [[Read about more science research highlights of Stampede1]] But, supercomputers live fast and retire young. With each new generation of computer processors, they become significantly faster and less expensive to operate than the one before it. On July 28, 2017, TACC introduced its most powerful supercomputer to date \u2013 Stampede2! Stampede2 has already been ranked as Most Powerful Supercomputer at an Academic Institution in the U.S. \u2013 12th in the world. It is as powerful as 100,000 desktop computers \u2014 one for every seat in Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. Image Stampede2 is the flagship supercomputer at The University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). \u201cStampede2 represents a new horizon for academic researchers in the U.S.,\u201d said Dan Stanzione , TACC\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt will serve as the workhorse for our nation\u2019s scientists and engineers, allowing them to improve our competitiveness and ensure that UT Austin remains a leader in computational research for the national open science community.\u201d The newest strategic resource for the nation\u2019s researchers, Stampede2 was made possible by a $30 million award from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Experts across all disciplines can now answer new questions that could not be addressed through theory or experimentation alone. TACC experts built the computer with support from The University of Texas System and industry partners Dell, Intel and Seagate. Researchers have already started using the system to conduct large-scale scientific studies. Some preliminary findings from early user projects include: Tumor identification from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data at The University of Texas at Austin. Real-time weather forecasting at the University of Oklahoma that has helped direct storm-chaser trucks. Earthquake predictions for the Southern California region at the University of California, San Diego that achieved a five-fold performance improvement over previously reported results. Teams from Stephen Hawking's cosmology research laboratory at Cambridge University , leveraging Stampede2, achieved unprecedented comparisons of previously performed simulations with gravitational wave data observed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). UT Austin is collaborating with several other leading universities to enable Stampede2 including Clemson University, Cornell University, Indiana University, The Ohio State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder. Stampede2 is expected to serve the scientific community through 2021, supporting tens of thousands of researchers during this period. An additional NSF award for $24 million was recently granted to cover upcoming operations and maintenance costs for the system. \u201cFor 16 years, the Texas Advanced Computing Center has earned its reputation for innovation and technological leadership,\u201d said Gregory L. Fenves, president of UT Austin. \u201cIt is only fitting that TACC has designed and now operates the most powerful supercomputer at any university in the U.S., Stampede2, enabling scientists and engineers to take on the greatest challenges facing society.\u201d Source: UT News",

    "text_content": "Professor Kristen Grauman Trains Computers to Understand What They\u2019re Seeing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor Kristen Grauman Trains Computers to Understand What They\u2019re Seeing Posted by Julianne Hodges on Monday, August 6, 2018 In order for a robot to be able to navigate the world, it must be able to \u201csee\u201d its environment and be able to process what it sees. However, since computers don\u2019t naturally know how to understand images, this is a task easier said than done. Computer vision researchers are up to the task of training these programs. Computer science professor Kristen Grauman researches computer vision, a field of computer science that deals with machine learning and image processing with the goal of having artificially-intelligent systems \u201cunderstand\u201d images and video. \u201cMy domain is vision, but nearly everything we do to tackle the problems involves machine learning as well,\u201d Grauman said. Her work also touches on robotics, since she also researches embodied vision, which takes into account the actions of the agent - human or robotic - that is seeing the environment. By incorporating action into computer vision, computers can solve problems in dynamic, changing environments instead of with just static images. \u201cThese are problems in computer vision where you aren\u2019t just thinking about analyzing static photos or videos that were already captured by some human photographer,\u201d Grauman said. \u201cInstead, you have an agent that can control its own camera, that can have multi-sensory input like sound and motion, or maybe feel and touch as well as sight, and must both learn and act in an ongoing, continual, long-term way with this information.\u201d According to Grauman, these systems in computer vision are increasingly using reinforcement learning, where the agent is rewarded for correct behavior over time, instead of supervised learning, where the system is taught patterns through labeled images. For example, reinforcement learning has been used in her work to help systems make inferences from initial observations and decide what to look for next . The common approach of training programs on pre-captured, labeled photographs offers an incomplete view of the situation. In contrast, Grauman\u2019s research group has investigated how to train intelligent computer vision systems by having it scan a scene or manipulate a 3D object in order to inspect it; this allows the agent to view an environment efficiently and make decisions about where to look. Although scientists don\u2019t completely understand how human sight works, many computer vision researchers, such as Grauman, find parallels in human neuroscience and how these computer vision systems are set up. For example, with embodied vision, cognitive science studies have shown that vision development in animals is influenced by body motion. Training computers to understand images and videos in place of humans, however, is critical because of the sheer scale of media that needs to be viewed. For example, it would take more than 16 years for someone to watch all of the new content uploaded to YouTube in one day. \u201cThere\u2019s just the volume of data versus time, but there\u2019s also discovery and mining for things that, even if you had the time and human attention to deal with, you can\u2019t scale,\u201d Grauman said. \u201cMachines are much better at discovering these things, given massive amounts of data, than you can expect humans to be.\u201d Systems that can monitor videos quickly and at the scale of social media can help, for example, in monitoring Facebook for people who are depressed or in danger, she said. This research could also lead to systems that can summarize video visually by finding the important parts of long videos. Image To overcome the challenge of viewing 360\u00b0 video, Kristen\u2019s team proposes a new computer vision problem that helps people determine where and what to look at in 360\u00b0 video. Input - 360\u00b0 video Output - normal-field-of-view video Task - controls the virtual camera direction (in 2D spherical direction) Goal - generate videos look as if captured by human videographer in the scene \u200bGrauman\u2019s research group has also done a lot of work with 360-degree videos . A recent project they\u2019ve worked on, AutoCam , solves the problem of where to look while viewing a 360-degree video. In such a video, which can often be viewed either with a virtual reality headset or by moving controls on a flat display like a computer, there is content in every direction. However, that makes it easy to for a viewer to miss what\u2019s important, especially if something is happening behind the current field of view. For AutoCam, the research group trained a program to move the camera angle automatically through the 360-degree environment, capturing the most important information. This results in a guided experience through the video in a normal field of view without having to turn around with a VR headset or using computer controls. \u201cIt\u2019s discovering where to look over time in a video that has omnidirectional content,\u201d Grauman said. The system was trained by processing lots of unlabeled YouTube videos so that it learned what properties are common to human-filmed videos, such as what kind of content the camera focuses on and the composition of the shots. When used on a 360-degree video, the program divides it into all possible viewing angles for each chunk of time and picks the pieces that best match these properties. \u201cNow, you could optimize for a path through those glimpses that tries to keep the most human-captured looking parts together so you get a smooth camera motion that also tries to frame the shot the way a human photographer would,\u201d Grauman said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially learning to record its own video by observing how people capture videos.\u201d The applications of this research goes back to embodied vision and robots: when moving around in an environment, autonomous robots would have to know in what direction they should direct their camera to complete their task, Grauman said. \u201cAny real-world application involving a mobile robot, the robot has to make decisions about where to go and how to turn the camera,\u201d she said. \u201cAny real-world application of an autonomous robot, such as a search-and-rescue robot that\u2019s going around the rubble of some natural disaster, there\u2019s no pre-prescribed program you could hand it to say, here\u2019s where you need to move. It has to actually explore on its own and, based on what it sees and what it hears, make intelligent judgement about where to go next or how to move the camera.\u201d Most recently, Grauman and graduate student Ruohan Guo worked on a project involving audio source separation . They trained a system to learn what kinds of sounds different objects, such as instruments, make and how to automatically separate the sounds. Grauman said her research group will be working on problems in embodied vision for a while. \u201cI think that the embodied vision is a big \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019 for the field,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s room to now take this bigger venture, so this will be next for a while, there\u2019s a lot we need to do here.\u201d",

The goal of Lin\u2019s project is to train teachers to offer the course, UTeach CS, to high school students and encourage interest in computer science learning. The project started out four years ago with a dual enrollment course offered by a handful of teachers, and it has expanded to include an AP CS Principles course that has spread across the country, with 280 new high school teachers trained to offer the course this year. Image The course uses a teaching technique called project-based learning pedagogy in which students learn by working in teams to solve problems. \u201cIt has a lot more critical thinking and other skills that we want our college graduates to have,\u201d Lin said. \u201cEven if students don\u2019t end up majoring in computer science, some of the skills that they learn from this class should help them succeed later in life.\u201d This CS Principles course is implemented by the UTeach Institute , which supports STEM education around the country,  The project-based learning pedagogy found in the CS Principles course prepares students for college-level courses by developing teamwork and critical thinking skills. One of the major goals of Lin\u2019s project is to appeal to a more diverse group of students, including women and minorities, and get them interested in computer science at an earlier age. \u201cThe way this course works is it\u2019s not a hardcore Java programming course,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIt tries to show people what the power and beauty and joy of computing can be, and lets students imagine how they might be able to use computer science to change the world.

Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, September 1, 2016 Source: CNS News | By Marc Airhart Peter Stone , a professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, led a groundbreaking study on artificial intelligence (AI) being released today. The study, produced by a panel of 17 experts from around the world, looks at how specialized applications of AI might affect life in a typical North American city by the year 2030. The panelists for \"Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030\" focused on eight domains: transportation; service robots; healthcare; education; low-resource communities; public safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment. Image Peter Stone. Photo credit to Vivian Abagiu. Those of us who don't work on AI have ideas about what might be coming in the next 15 years. But you have an insider's perspective. What kinds of things are coming that will have a big impact on society, yet are not even on most people's radars? At this point, some of the upcoming transformations in transportation are already on most people's radars. However, I think people are less aware of the potential transformations in home robotics, natural language dialogue systems, and healthcare, just to name a few. For example, it's possible that we will begin to see home and service robots that go far beyond vacuuming our floors, with the ability to understand human speech, visually identify people and objects, and manipulate objects with arms and grippers. In healthcare, we may see AI-powered assistants helping doctors match symptoms to known diseases, AI systems that use clinical, environmental, and social data from millions of patients to develop more personalized diagnoses and treatments, and an expansion in automated systems performing surgery and caring for patients. Across many areas of life, the ability to interact with machines conversationally, rather than by typing narrowly defined commands and pushing buttons, will have a profound impact on the way we live. For any of these possibilities to become reality, there are still significant technical challenges to meet, as well as social, institutional, and legal barriers to overcome. The report compares and contrasts these challenges and barriers across the various domains. But in all cases, the potential payoffs are huge, so motivation should be high. What kinds of AI applications are you most excited about seeing come into common use by 2030? Personally, I'm most excited about the possibilities in transportation and service robotics, if only because that's where my biggest research contributions have been, and continue to be. I have been involved in research on autonomous driving since 2003, long before most people imagined they'd be feasible in the near future. I also entered a car in the DARPA Urban Challenge. I'm also very deeply involved in research on service robotics, which serves as the topic for my current Freshman Research Initiative stream.* My students and I are investigating algorithms for long-term autonomy in human-populated environments. [* The Freshman Research Initiative is a program at UT Austin's College of Natural Sciences that gives first-year students the chance to initiate and engage in real-world research experience with faculty and graduate students.] We've seen more and more AI applications in daily life, and many more wonders are promised by science fiction. What kinds of things probably won't come true, at least not by 2030? (I'm still waiting for that flying car we were promised in the 1950s) Well, flying cars aren't out of the question. At least one or two startups are going down this path. But I think the main thing that the general public doesn't understand is that there's a huge technical difference between AI technologies that are developed and targeted towards specific application domains and general purpose AI that can be sprinkled on top of any device to make it more intelligent. The former is the focus of much research and business development, but the latter is still science fiction. It is quite tempting to think that if AI technologies can help drive your car, then they ought to also be able to fold your laundry. The reality is that these two applications require very different algorithms and capabilities. They may both be possible. But they will require very separate, sustained research thrusts. What are some of the biggest potential negative impacts of AI in the next 15 years and what can citizens, organizations and governments do to reduce those risks? As with any technology, AI-based technologies have potential for both positive and negative uses. This is treated extensively in the AI100 report. The goal is to give a balanced and realistic view of both the positive and negative potential impacts of AI technologies. For example, it's conceivable that AI applications used in public safety and security applications could exacerbate and codify some of the biases inherent in human decision-making, for example by training from data that reflects these biases. But if carefully developed and deployed, AI technologies could also mitigate these biases. With regards to what citizens, organizations, and governments can do to help ensure positive outcomes, that is the main focus of Section III of the AI 100 report. In particular, the Study Panel suggests that pathways be defined for accumulating expertise about AI at all levels of government, and that we guard against the impulse for over-regulation, which is likely to do more harm than good. But as the report emphasizes, the time is right \"for social debate on how the economic fruits of AI technologies should be shared.\" And finally, the question on everyone's mind, are smart machines going to take over the world? No. Not in the foreseeable future. It's not that I take this question lightly - it's a sensible question to ask. But the reasons I don't think it's likely are summarized in my answers to the previous two. We're nowhere near the development of what people refer to as general-purpose AI, and, there are steps we can take now to maximize the chances that AI technologies will do more good than harm. As with any technology, there are risks and challenges, but I wouldn't be devoting my career to the study of AI if I didn't believe that the societal influences would be, on balance, positive.

Austin was ranked based on the number of employers competing for top-tier, enterprise-level cybersecurity talent and the number of open job listings in the field, according to the Randstad press release. Computer science senior Angie Murphy said she has seen a growing demand for technology professionals during her time at UT. \u201cTechnology isn\u2019t going away,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThere\u2019s way more opportunities here, and we\u2019re becoming more and more important to have in any high-tech industry.\u201d According to Hakeem Allen, assistant account executive at Raffetto Herman Strategic Communications, 98 employers in Austin are looking to fill 270 jobs with qualified talent. Joshua Olson, Austin sales director of Randstad Technologies, said Austin\u2019s new ranking is fantastic for UT students entering the technological workforce. \u201cAustin is a hotbed for new technologies,\u201d Olson said. \u201cCompanies like Google, Amazon and Dell are coming to the area, and there\u2019s never been more of a need to allocate resources to cybersecurity.\u201d According to IT information website CIO.com\u2019s 15th annual State of the CIO Survey, 46 percent of IT executives consider security management a top priority for the upcoming year, up from 31 percent in 2015. Image Associate Professor Brent Waters Brent Waters , associate professor of computer science, said security and cryptography are absolutely necessary for UT students to learn in today\u2019s software industry. \u201cIn general, security is an integral part of software engineering and development,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThirty years ago, people could build software without security assistance, but this simply can\u2019t be done today.\u201d Austin has one of the lowest median salaries ($106,800 a year) for its cybertechnology workforce, according to the Randstad report. \u201cIt\u2019s never been a better time for UT juniors and seniors to look for a career path in technology,\u201d said Olson. \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be a shortage of opportunities to stay in Austin, and, depending on their skill set or where they want to go, they can pretty much write their own ticket.\u201d According to Randstand Technologies, the 11 other markets in the United States where cybersecurity talent is in high demand are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.",

    "text_content": "New Method of Producing Random Numbers Could Improve Cybersecurity | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Method of Producing Random Numbers Could Improve Cybersecurity Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, May 16, 2016 Original article by College of Natural Sciences With an advance that one cryptography expert called a \"masterpiece,\" University of Texas at Austin computer scientists have developed a new method for producing truly random numbers, a breakthrough that could be used to encrypt data, make electronic voting more secure, conduct statistically significant polls and more accurately simulate complex systems such as Earth's climate. Image Photo credit - James Bowe, via Create Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license. The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications. Computer science professor David Zuckerman and graduate student Eshan Chattopadhyay will present research about their method in June at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), the Association for Computing Machinery's premier theoretical computer science conference. An invitation to present at the conference is based on a rigorous peer review process to evaluate the work's correctness and significance. Their paper will be one of three receiving the STOC Best Paper Award. \"This is a problem I've come back to over and over again for more than 20 years,\" says Zuckerman. \"I'm thrilled to have solved it.\" Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman publicly released a draft paper describing their method for making random numbers in an online forum last year. In a field more accustomed to small, incremental improvements, the computer science community hailed the method, suggesting that, compared with earlier methods, this one is light years ahead. Oded Goldreich, a professor of computer science at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, commented that even if it had only been a moderate improvement over existing methods, it would have justified a \"night-long party.\" \"When I heard about it, I couldn't sleep,\" says Yael Kalai, a senior researcher working in cryptography at Microsoft Research New England who has also worked on randomness extraction. \"I was so excited. I couldn't believe it. I ran to the (online) archive to look at the paper. It's really a masterpiece.\" The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers. Weakly random sequences, such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, harbor predictable patterns. Truly random sequences have nothing predictable about them, like a coin toss. The new research seems to defy that old adage in computer programming, \"Garbage in, garbage out.\" In fact, it's the latest, most powerful addition to a class of methods that Zuckerman pioneered in the 1990s called randomness extractors . Previous versions of randomness extractors were less practical because they either required that one of the two source sequences be truly random (which presents a chicken or the egg problem) or that both source sequences be close to truly random. This new method sidesteps both of those restrictions and allows the use of two sequences that are only weakly random. An important application for random numbers is in generating keys for data encryption that are hard for hackers to crack. Data encryption is critical for making secure credit card purchases and bank transactions, keeping personal medical data private and shielding military communications from enemies, among many practical applications. Zuckerman says that although there are already methods for producing high-quality random numbers, they are very computationally demanding. His method produces higher quality randomness with less effort. \"One common way that encryption is misused is by not using high-quality randomness,\" says Zuckerman. \"So in that sense, by making it easier to get high-quality randomness, our methods could improve security.\" Their paper shows how to generate only one truly random number \u2013 akin to one coin toss \u2013 but Zuckerman's former student Xin Li has already demonstrated how to expand it to create sequences of many more random numbers. The website where Zuckerman and Chattopadhyay posted their draft last summer, called the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity, allows researchers to share their work and receive feedback before publishing final versions in journals or at conferences. Computer scientists and mathematicians have been carefully reviewing the article, providing suggestions and even extending the method to make it more powerful.

Computer science professor Calvin Lin is one of these educators. He has won a College of Natural Sciences Teaching Excellence Award in 2003, the Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award in 2011, the President's Associates Teaching Excellence Award in 2016 and was elected to the UT Academy of Distinguished Teachers in 2013. Here, he talks about how he challenges his students to struggle to overcome their challenges. Image On his keys to success: The biggest challenge is trying to keep students engaged. Over the years I've developed a lot of little things that I do. Number one, I think it's important to have fun. I think if you're having fun then there's more chance the students will have fun and there's more chance that they'll actually want to learn things, want to be there and be engaged. It's really important to take the bigger picture. When I think back to when I first started, we would focus on the content we had to cover, but the larger goals are things we want students to come away with, independent of the content. It's not about me lecturing and having them just slurp it in and have it seep through their eyes, it's how I can get them to think and to ask questions and be willing to be uncomfortable and to take risks. Also, I really want the students to understand the value of struggling and persevering. If they can learn to persevere, and they can see benefit from that, then they can apply that anywhere in life. My goal is to challenge them and hope that they challenge themselves because that's how they prove themselves and expand the boundaries of what they can do. That means they have to be willing to take risks, know that it's okay to fail and to learn that often, the way you make progress towards a solution is by failing in little ways. Be constantly asking questions because that's how you find problems. That's how you think of answers and solutions. On students as sources of inspiration: One student I had many years ago was really struggling in one of my upper-division classes and around the middle of the semester he started coming into my office hours. He didn't whine about his grade\u2014he was basically failing the class\u2014he was just there to learn. Twice a week, he would come in and we would go through material, and he would ask all of these detailed questions. He worked so hard, and this is that perseverance I'm talking about. At the end of the year I graded half his final and the TA graded half and I was trying to be very careful that I was being fair and not give him a better grade because I liked him and he had worked so hard\u2026He aced this exam. He got a solid C in the class, which maybe some people wouldn't be excited about, but considering how he was certainly going to fail, it was amazing. \u2026When I first came [to UT], I focused on teaching a course or giving a lecture, but now I realize we have impact, sometimes unintentionally, in many other ways. One year, I spoke at a summer seminar where students would come and meet various faculty, just to get to know us as people. I don't remember it being a very memorable event. I was afraid that the students were going to be bored. Then, a couple of years later we had this great student about to graduate. I knew her because she had taken honors courses, and she had transferred in from math. I asked her, \"What made you become a computer science major?\" She said, \"It was that talk you came and gave at [the summer] seminar. You really made it sound exciting.\" I don't remember even saying anything about computer science. It's just one example that you can have an impact, even when you don't know it Expert from CNS's A Peek Into the Minds of Award-Winning Educators News Categories Faculty Tags Calvin Lin",

    "text_content": "Artificial Intelligence System Gives Fashion Advice | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Artificial Intelligence System Gives Fashion Advice Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, October 28, 2019 Minimal outfit edits suggest minor changes to an existing outfit in order to improve its fashionability. For example, changes might entail (left) removing an accessory; (middle) changing to a blouse with higher neckline; (right) tucking in a shirt. College of Natural Sciences News by Esther R Robards-Forbes People turn to many different sources for clothing style advice, from magazines to best friends to Instagram. Soon, though, you may be able to ask your smartphone. A University of Texas at Austin computer science team, in partnership with researchers from Cornell Tech, Georgia Tech and Facebook AI Research, has developed an artificial intelligence system that can look at a photo of an outfit and suggest helpful tips to make it more fashionable. Suggestions may include tweaks such as selecting a sleeveless top or a longer jacket. \"We thought of it like a friend giving you feedback,\" said Kristen Grauman , a professor of computer science whose previous research has largely focused on visual recognition for artificial intelligence. \"It's also motivated by a practical idea: that we can work with a given outfit to make small changes so it's just a bit better.\" The tool, named Fashion++ , uses visual recognition systems to analyze the color, pattern, texture and shape of garments in an image. It considers where edits will have the most impact. It then offers several alternative outfits to the user. Fashion++ was trained using more than 10,000 images of outfits shared publicly on online sites for fashion enthusiasts. Finding images of fashionable outfits was easy, said graduate student Kimberly Hsiao. Finding unfashionable images proved challenging. So, she came up with a workaround. She mixed images of fashionable outfits to create less-fashionable examples and trained the system on what not to wear. \"As fashion styles evolve, the AI can continue to learn by giving it new images, which are abundant on the internet,\" Hsiao said. Grauman and Hsiao will present their approach at next week's International Conference on Computer Vision in Seoul, South Korea. Like all AI systems, bias can creep in through the data sets for Fashion++. The researchers pointed out that vintage looks are harder to recognize as stylish because training images came from the internet, which has been in wide use only since the 1990s. Additionally, because the users submitting images were mostly from North America, styles from other parts of the world don't show up as much. Another challenge is that many images of fashionable clothes appear on models, but bodies come in many sizes and shapes, affecting fashion choices. Next up, Grauman and Hsiao are working toward letting the AI learn what flatters different body shapes so its recommendations can be more tailored. \"We are examining the interaction between how a person's body is shaped and how the clothing would suit them. We're excited to broaden the applicability to people of all body sizes and shapes by doing this research,\" Grauman said.

Housed in the nation\u2019s 9th ranked CS department, the Turing Scholars program combines all of the advantages of a small, private university with the significant resources of a large research institution. It offers students small classes, close relationships with faculty, and guaranteed honors housing. The program also offers students access to a vast menu of undergraduate and graduate courses, ample opportunities for interdisciplinary studies, and career placement options with industry partners. Its rigorous curriculum and established national reputation ensure that Turing students are among the most highly-skilled and sought after graduates in the field. The Need for Scholarships With a top-ten ranking and over 2,300 students, UTCS is home to the field\u2019s largest concentration of young talent in the field of computer science. It is also one of only three public schools in the top ten, putting it in direct competition with well-funded private universities like Stanford and MIT. This leaves the university at a disadvantage in terms of its ability to offer the scholarships that are critical to recruiting top students. With the generous support of the Kodosky Foundation, the university has launched a campaign to dramatically increase the number of available scholarships. By equipping this unique community of scholars with the proper scholarship incentives, the university can ensure the most talented students in computer science will have every reason to call Austin home. Understanding Endowed Scholarships Establishing an endowed scholarship offers donors the opportunity to create a lasting legacy. The principal of an endowed scholarship is invested by the university and the interest generated is used as scholarship funds. Endowed scholarships may be established starting at $25,000. The invested principal will grow over time, maximizing the impact of your gift and ensuring that it will support computer science students for generations to come. Endowed scholarships may be named for you, your family, or someone you wish to honor. Company Match Many employers sponsor matching gift programs (Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and will match any charitable contributions made by employees. Does your company have a matching gift program? Tip: You will need to request the matching gift from your employer. Make a Gift",

Image The University of Texas\u2019s Stampede supercomputer, on which the 200-terabyte maths proof was solved. Three computer scientists have announced the largest-ever mathematics proof: a file that comes in at a whopping 200 terabytes1, roughly equivalent to all the digitized text held by the US Library of Congress. The researchers have created a 68-gigabyte compressed version of their solution \u2014 which would allow anyone with about 30,000 hours of spare processor time to download, reconstruct and verify it \u2014 but a human could never hope to read through it. Computer-assisted proofs too large to be directly verifiable by humans have become commonplace, and mathematicians are familiar with computers that solve problems in combinatorics \u2014 the study of finite discrete structures \u2014 by checking through umpteen individual cases. Still, \u201c200 terabytes is unbelievable\u201d, says Ronald Graham, a mathematician at the University of California, San Diego. The previous record-holder is thought to be a 13-gigabyte proof2, published in 2014. The puzzle that required the 200-terabyte proof, called the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, has eluded mathematicians for decades. In the 1980s, Graham offered a prize of US$100 for anyone who could solve it. (He duly presented the cheque to one of the three computer scientists, Marijn Heule of the University of Texas at Austin, earlier this month.) The problem asks whether it is possible to colour each positive integer either red or blue, so that no trio of integers a, b and cthat satisfy Pythagoras\u2019 famous equation a2 + b2 = c2 are all the same colour. For example, for the Pythagorean triple 3, 4 and 5, if 3 and 5 were coloured blue, 4 would have to be red. In a paper posted on the arXiv server on 3 May, Heule, Oliver Kullmann of Swansea University, UK, and Victor Marek of the University of Kentucky in Lexington have now shown that there are many allowable ways to colour the integers up to 7,824 \u2014 but when you reach 7,825, it is impossible for every Pythagorean triple to be multicoloured1. There are more than 102,300 ways to colour the integers up to 7,825, but the researchers took advantage of symmetries and several techniques from number theory to reduce the total number of possibilities that the computer had to check to just under 1 trillion. It took the team about 2 days running 800 processors in parallel on the University of Texas\u2019s Stampede supercomputer to zip through all the possibilities. The researchers then verified the proof using another computer program. Image The numbers 1 to 7,824 can be coloured either red or blue so that no trio a, b and c that satisfies a2 +b2 = c2 is all the same colour. The grid of 7,824 squares here shows one such solution, with numbers coloured red or blue (a white square can be either). But for the numbers 1 to 7,825, there is no solution. Facts vs theory The Pythagorean triples problem is one of many similar questions in Ramsey theory, an area of mathematics that is concerned with finding structures that must appear in sufficiently large sets. For example, the researchers think that if the problem had allowed three colours, rather than two, they would still hit a point where it would be impossible to avoid creating a Pythagorean triple where a, b and c were all the same colour; indeed, they conjecture that this is the case for any finite choice of colours. Any proof for more colours will probably be much larger even than the 200-terabyte 2-colour proof, unless researchers can simplify the case-by-case checking process with a breakthrough in understanding. Although the computer solution has cracked the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, it hasn\u2019t provided an underlying reason why the colouring is impossible, or explored whether the number 7,825 is meaningful, says Kullmann. That echoes a common philosophical objection to the value of computer-assisted proofs: they may be correct, but are they really mathematics? If mathematicians\u2019 work is understood to be a quest to increase human understanding of mathematics, rather than to accumulate an ever-larger collection of facts, a solution that rests on theory seems superior to a computer ticking off possibilities. That did ultimately occur in the case of the 13-gigabyte proof from 2014, which solved a special case of a question called the Erd\u0151s discrepancy problem. A year later, mathematician Terence Tao of the University of California, Los Angeles, solved the general problem the old-fashioned way3 \u2014 a much more satisfying resolution.",

From left to right, they are Katie Genter, Sanmit Narvekar, Josiah Hanna, Josh Kelle and Jake Menashe. The UT Austin Villa robot soccer team , led by University of Texas at Austin computer science professor Peter Stone, returned from the 2016 RoboCup competition in Leipzig, Germany as the world champions in the 3D Simulation league and with an impressive second-place win in the Standard Platform League (SPL). Image The team worked late into the night to prepare for semi-finals. The RoboCup competition challenges participants to program intelligent robotic systems to operate on their own in dynamic environments. Participants in the 3D Simulation league program artificially intelligent virtual robots that compete against each other in a physically realistic simulated game of soccer. Meanwhile, teams in the SPL league compete using identical humanoid Nao robots from Aldebaran Robotics. The challenge is to program the robots to compete as a team, without human intervention. The robots have to be able to autonomously walk, kick, navigate the soccer field and visually recognize objects and other players \u2014 all while cooperating against the opposing team. Image UT Austin Villa players defend the goal from a Nao-Team HTWK player. The UT Austin Villa\u2019s 3D Simulation victory marks the third year in a row and fifth time in six years that the team has prevailed in this category. The second-place finish in the SPL marks the team\u2019s best showing in that league since they won the world championship in 2012 . The SPL team started off strong this year and didn\u2019t concede a single goal in their first five games, one of which was against the defending world champions, UNSW Australia . After another three victories, one of which was a nail-biter that ended in a sudden-death penalty-kick showdown, the team advanced to the finals. The SPL crew\u2019s final game was against the four-time world champion team B-Humans. UT Austin Villa successfully defeated this team in the past when they won their 2012 world champion title. Image UT Austin Villa team members watch from the sidelines during a tight game with Nao-Team HTWK. This year the two teams were well-matched with neither able to score in this final game \u2014 the first time that the B-Humans were ever held scoreless for an entire bout. The game was decided in overtime with penalty kicks and UT Austin Villa lost, claiming second place. Videos of many of the Standard Platform games can be viewed here . UT Austin Villa\u2019s SPL team is made up of Stone, doctoral students Katie Genter, Jake Menashe, Josiah Hanna, Elad Liebman, Sanmit Narvekar and Ruohan Zhang, and master\u2019s student Josh Kelle.

Browne, who passed away on Friday, January 19 at age 83. In addition to teaching computer science, Browne was one of the first faculty members of the Department of Computer Science, which was founded in 1966, and also served as the department\u2019s chairman for several years. He was internationally recognized as an expert in parallel programming and computation and performance optimization. He played an important role in shaping the UT computer science department, and before coming to UT Computer Science he also helped establish the first computational center at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Browne, a UT alumnus who earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1960, was a faculty member at UT for over 45 years. Before becoming a computer science professor, he taught physics at UT until 1964. Throughout his academic career, Browne has researched a wide variety of topics in addition to computer science, from cancer to black holes, and was a fellow of five different professional societies including the Association for Computing Machinery. Browne excelled both in research and in the classroom; he published nearly 500 research papers throughout his career, and he received The University of Texas at Austin Career Research Excellence Award in 2004. However, Browne was most proud of his work supervising 69 Ph.D. students and 65 master\u2019s degree students as well as numerous undergraduate honors students.

I love doing all the code,\u201d Calderon said. Code Orange is a student-led nonprofit. Its goal is to teach young children from underserved communities in Austin not only how to code, but also how to use a variety of technologies. Current leader Moiz Rizvi , a computer science junior, and several of his peers founded Code Orange last September. The organization uses Scratch, a visual programming language, to teach seven- to 12-year-old children how to make interactive games, keep websites and learn programming languages, such as Python. The group also provides each child a role model through a mentor/mentee program. They want to give each child a mentor to not only teach them how to code, but also to be someone they can be friends with. \u201cIt\u2019s very focused on creativity, expression, without losing sight of the computing part,\u201d Rizvi said. \u201cWe all firmly believe that you can benefit a lot more from not just learning the code \u2026 but a lot of things that are far away from things that are just programming.\u201d Last Friday, the organization held a demo day, in which over 50 students from Zavala and UT Elementary Schools demonstrated projects they had been working on throughout the spring semester. \u201cI think the projects and the kids\u2019 hard work really speaks for itself,\u201d Rizvi said. Most of the children created games, while some, such as Calderon, learned Python and HTML. \u201cI\u2019m really glad my mentor helped me,\u201d Calderon said. \u201cIt was an amazing experience. I would love doing it again.\u201d Calderon\u2019s mentor \u2014 Sohum Chitalia, a finance, business honors and computer science junior \u2014 said he was very proud of Calderon. Parents of the students attended the awards ceremony, during which students received a certificate indicating that they were a part of the mentorship program. \u201cThis is what he wants to do later in life \u2014 computer science,\u201d said Lisa Calderon, Joaquin\u2019s mother. \u201cI like that he\u2019s getting instruction. It is a very good program.\u201d The organization currently consists of UT students, but Rizvi said they have plans to expand to allow community members to join the group as either teachers or mentors \u2014 they\u2019re recruiting this coming summer. Rizvi said they do not just want to make an impact in the lives of children; they want to reach out to the public. \u201cIf you came out to demo day, you would\u2019ve seen for yourself how genuinely engaged and talented these kids were in the first place,\u201d he said.

His research involves the use of formal mathematics to write specifications for computer hardware and software and to use proof techniques to determine the validity of such specifications. Image Over the past 30 years, Hunt has been modeling and analyzing hardware systems, primarily microprocessors, using the the ACL2 theorem-proving system (and it predecessors).  His methods are in use by a number of companies, most notably by Centaur Technology, the developer of the VIA Nano (a X86-compatible) microprocessor and by Oracle for the design of their SPARC microprocessor.  The verification techniques that Hunt and his students have developed are now in everyday commercial use; these techniques help assure that the results produced by such commercial designs are indeed correct.  This helps companies assure their customers that their products will produce correct answers when asked to compute specified results.  This is important because microprocessors are foundational in our financial, medical, information, and transportation industries.  And thus, the accuracy of computation lies at the heart of our way of life. ACM has named 49 Distinguished Members for their individual contributions and their singular impacts on the vital field of computing.

Who We Are Artists and Designers A new, innovative department was created in the College of Fine Arts focused on art, audio, and design called Arts and Entertainment Technologies (AET). Students graduating from this department are naturally interdisciplinary from learning about how to create art and music, produce game and level designs, and even code! That said, AET students typically focus on a discipline to develop expertise. You find students who are 2D and 3D game artists, technical artists, music and sound designers, game and level designers, technical designers,\u00a0and scripters. Programmers The Department of Computer Science (CS)\u00a0has been ranked as a top 10 program in the U.S. for decades. CS students first learn the fundamentals of programming before concentrating on game programming, providing them with both the breadth and depth of knowledge to not only be productive on day one but continue to be productive as the ever evolving development landscape changes. The game concentration includes courses such as graphics, game technology, game programming paradigms, and the two Capstone courses where they learn how to work in interdisciplinary\u00a0teams to create complex, maintainable\u00a0games in a short time timeframe. Animators The Radio-Television-Film (RTF) department is a top 10 program among public universities in the U.S. Students studying in RTF who are\u00a0focused on game development learn about 2D and 3D animation, world building, and storytelling. Many students who focus on animation also know rigging. The Game Development and Design Program was great, its interdisciplinary approach allows you to choose your area of interest and collaborate with different disciplines. Through the program I began familiarizing myself with game development, started networking with industry folks and landed my first internship, which would later allow me to obtain my first full-time position as a game designer after graduation.

Waters\u2019 innovations enhance security efforts at a time when greater volumes of highly confidential data are moving to the cloud. Traditionally, public-key encryption makes use of a public key that targets ciphertexts to a specific user that holds one secret key. Waters\u2019 introduction of attribute-based encryption presented a new design where an administrator can create a policy-specific decryption key that will enable decryption of only the underlying files that satisfy the policy. Functional encryption, as conceived by Waters, takes things further by allowing an administrator to create private keys that allow a decryptor to learn only a particular function of the encrypted data, thus limiting their view to what they need to know about the data. Waters is an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He has been named a Sloan Fellow, a Packard Fellow and a Microsoft Faculty Fellow. His many additional honors include receiving the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. The Grace Murray Hopper Award is given to the outstanding young computer professional of the year, selected on the basis of a single recent major technical or service contribution. This award is accompanied by a prize of $35,000. The candidate must have been 35 years of age or less at the time the qualifying contribution was made. Financial support for this award is provided by Microsoft. Brent will be formally honored along with three other 2015 ACM prestigious award recipients at the ACM Awards Banquet on June 11 in San Francisco. News Categories Awards & Honors Tags Brent Waters",

Mirarab\u2019s dissertation, Novel Scalable Approaches for Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenomic Reconstruction , addresses the growing need to analyze large-scale biological sequence data efficiently and accurately. To address this challenge, Mirarab introduces several methods: PASTA, a scalable and accurate algorithm that can align data sets up to one million sequences; statistical binning, a novel technique for reducing noise in estimation of evolutionary trees for individual parts of the genome; and ASTRAL, a new summary method that can run on 1,000 species in one day and has outstanding accuracy. These methods were essential in analyzing very large genomic datasets of birds and plants. Mirarab is currently an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. He obtained a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin, which nominated him for this award. He will share a $10,000 prize with another Honorable Mention awardee, Aaron Sidford of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with financial sponsorship provided by Google Inc. About Siavash's Work The following text is reprinted from an article produced by UT Computer Science on 12/11/24. A new computational technique developed at The University of Texas at Austin has enabled an international consortium to produce an avian tree of life that points to the origins of various bird species. A graduate student at the university is a leading author on papers describing the new technique and sharing the consortium\u2019s findings about bird evolution in the journal Science. The results of the four-year effort \u2014 which relied in part on supercomputers at the university's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) \u2014 shed light on the timing of a \"big bang\" in bird evolution, rearrange evolutionary relationships between some bird species and provide new insights on the origins of song pattern recognition in birds, as well as a host of other avian traits. To build the new bird tree of life, researchers first sequenced the complete genomes of 48 living bird species...

So, it must have been kismet that her first motion picture credit for DreamWorks Animation is \u201cKung Fu Panda 3,\u201d which boasts an all-star cast including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Bryan Cranston. It opens in theaters Friday. \u201cHow really awesome is it that my first movie is about pandas?\u201d Davalath, who spent most of her childhood and teens in the Alamo City, where her parents still live, said in a phone chat. \u201cMy desk at work is covered with them, and practically every gift I\u2019ve gotten has been panda-oriented.\u201d Davalath, 29, a character technical director on the animated feature, was responsible for what she called rigging \u2014 \u201cplacing joints into stuffed animals or static puppets.\u201d She also programs a control system that allows them to move around, she said, before handing her work to the animators who complete the magic. For \u201cPanda 3,\u201d she worked on the bodies of the village pigs and the small pandas, she said, making sure the elbows and knees were soft and rounded, reflecting lots of baby fat. \u201cSo, every time you see tiny pandas walking around, it was me who helped put them there,\u201d she said. Her DreamWorks supervisor Kevin Rogers praised her skills. \u201cWe were fortunate to have Megha working on the baby pandas,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cOver the life of the show, the use of baby pandas grew, in part because of how cute they were in animation. \u201cThis would not have been so without the solid rigs built by her,\u201d Rogers added, \u201cproving that Megha\u2019s contributions to \u2018Kung Fu Panda 3\u2019 were invaluable.\u201d She also worked on lots of hair in the movie, she said, giving that movement too. For instance, Davalath was responsible for the long mustache and prominent eyebrows of teacher Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Davalath said she wanted to study movie animation since she was a child, even writing a paper about it at Hobby Middle School. Her path, however, took a couple of detours. She attended a high school that had little to do with the arts, Health Careers High, a magnet school in the Northside Independent School District that prepares students for occupations in health care. \u201cI basically wanted to go there to be with my friends,\u201d she said. Her dad, Nataraj Davalath, a longtime software developer at USAA, influenced her choice for college major, she said. \u201cHe said he would let me go into art school as long as I got a degree in computer science first. That way, I\u2019d have a good foundation,\u201d she said. That\u2019s what she studied at the University of Texas at Austin . \u201cI took classes in art, so it was the perfect blend of the technical and the creative.\u201d After graduating in 2008, she attended graduate school at Texas A&M University, where she began specializing. She earned a degree in visualization, which encompassed rigging. A&M also was the place she made invaluable contacts, as it hosted experts from DreamWorks and other big studios. \u201cIt was a really good networking school,\u201d she said. The year of her graduation in 2011, she was hired by DreamWorks. Although \u201cPanda\u201d wasn\u2019t the first movie she worked on, it is the first one to be released. Her next project is \u201cTrolls,\u201d which is due out in late 2016. \u201cI\u2019m part of the hair team,\u201c she said, \u201cresponsible for the look, style and movement of the hair. \u201cWe worked on characters voiced by Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake and Russell Brand.\u201d Meanwhile, her excited parents will be watching for her name on the big screen. \u201cWe already got tickets,\u201d her father said. He\u2019s also happy his guidance helped Megha get the well-rounded education that figured into her success. \u201cI remember when Megha was in high school, she wanted to go into a special effects or animation program right away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I encouraged her to get a basic technical degree before getting into the entertainment industry.\u201d Megha remains grateful to this day that she listened to her dad. \u201cI\u2019ve utilized everything I\u2019ve learned.\u201d Source: San Antonio Express-News News Categories Alumni Tags Megha Davalath",

Dr. Aaronson will be joining as the David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science and will be leading the charge to establish UT\u2019s presence in quantum computing; Dr. Moshkovitz will be joining as an Associate Professor in theoretical computer science. Aaronson and Moshkovitz join UTCS\u2019s already exceptionally strong theory research group, including Anna Gal, Adam Klivans, Greg Plaxton, Eric Price, Vijaya Ramachandran, Brent Waters, and David Zuckerman. Their addition to this group extends an exceptional lineage that began with one of the field\u2019s founding fathers, Edsger Dijkstra, who, among a laundry list of other accomplishments, laid the groundwork for what is now considered theoretical computer science. Dr. Aaronson is one of the leading researchers in the fields of quantum computing and complexity class theory. His popular blog, Shtetl-Optimized, explores a wide variety of subjects in his areas of research (and beyond), including a series of lectures he delivered at MIT entitled \u201cQuantum Computing since Democritus.\u201d Dr. Aaronson notes that Texas has produced some of the most important research\u2014and researchers\u2014in the field of quantum computing. In addition to his professorship, he has also accepted the position of founding director of a new center at UT for quantum computing (proposed motto: \u201cHook Em Hadamards\u201d). Dr. Moshkovitz will be joining UT Computer Science as an associate professor. She is a noted professor at MIT, winning a teaching award for her course on the design and analysis of algorithms, and, like Dr. Aaronson, completed a postdoc at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. (The IAS was also home to Albert Einstein, Kurt Godel, and John von Neumann.) Two of her former students went on to win undergraduate research awards at MIT, and she is well-known in the algorithms community for a widely-read paper on the PCP (Probabilistically-Checkable Proofs) algorithm, which gives an important result about randomized algorithms to verify proofs of certain classes of problems. Both Dr. Aaronson and Dr. Moshkovitz will officially join UT Computer Science in the fall of 2016. News Categories Faculty Tags Scott Aaronson Dana Moshkovitz",

Luckily, there\u2019s a camp for nearly every interest these days. And as always, UT is in the vanguard. First Bytes , a one-week camp for high school girls, is designed to dispel myths about computer science. With an emphasis on problem solving, campers get hands-on programming experience, meet professional computer scientists, and visit research labs. They also get to enjoy campus life and see what the college experience is like. Image First Bytes and Code Longhorn are part of UT\u2019s efforts to bring more women and minorities into science and math. \u201cWe try to educate these young women about computer science and all the roles it can play in any career they choose,\u201d says coordinator Mary Esther Middleton, BA \u201983. \u201cYou can see it in their faces when they light up and have that moment of discovery.\u201d First Bytes is part of a larger UT initiative to increase the role of women in science and math, and it appears to be working. One quarter of incoming female computer science majors in 2015 had participated in the program. Code Longhorn , new this summer, follows the same one-week model but targets underrepresented students of any gender. In both cases, a teacher or counselor recommends the applicants, and corporate sponsorships cover their costs to attend. The camps received a major boost this year with grants from the AT&T Foundation and Google. These have allowed First Bytes to expand from 60 to 120 campers and Code Longhorn to kick off its first year with 60 campers. Image Taylor Barnett, BSA \u201915 Taylor Barnett, BSA \u201915, knows from experience how First Bytes expands opportunity. She began as a camper from Weatherford, west of Fort Worth. Later, as a UT student, she served as a camp assistant and mentor. Now working for a San Francisco-based tech startup, she has given back to the computer science department not only monetarily but also by becoming a camp presenter. \u201cFirst Bytes helped me see all the different career options I would have if I studied computer science,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exposed to all those options within my high school. It widened my view of the field.\u201d With First Bytes and now with Code Longhorn, Middleton says, \u201cwe hope that what our campers take away from their experience is a strong level of confidence \u2014 a feeling that when they walk into that classroom later, they\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d Learn more about UT\u2019s computer science summer camps.

At UT Computer Science, we are proud to say that our future is bright indeed as we welcome four new faculty into our robotics and systems groups. These talented individuals join four other recent faculty additions, ensuring that UT Computer Science will continue to be a leader in the field for years to come. Vijay Chidambaram - Systems Image Ph.D. 2015, University of Wisconsin-Madison Operating Systems File Systems Storage Systems Vijay Chidambaram completed his gradute studies at  University of Wisconsin Madison, where he was also an Alumni Scholar. Vijay is interested in operating systems, file systems, and storage systems. He worked with Professor Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Profesor Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau in the The ADvanced Systems Laboratory (ADSL). Vijay was awarded the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in 2014. Since then, he has been a postdoctoral research fellow at the VMWare Research Group. He will join UT Computer Science as an assistant professor in spring 2016. Vijay\u2019s research goal is to build systems that enable users to run any unmodified desktop application on the cloud, obtaining both scale-out performance and guarantees about application behavior in the face of crashes. His research has taken several steps towards this goal. He has developed new file-system techniques that increase scalability and performance while maintaining file-system consistency. Vijay has extended and implemented these techniques in distributed storage systems. To support these techniques, he developed new storage interfaces and file-system primitives. Finally, Vijay developed tools to analyze applications to understand their failure semantics. Scott Niekum - Robotics Image Ph.D. 2013, University of Massachusetts Amherst Artificial Intelligence Robotics Scott Niekum is an Assistant Professor and the director of the Personal Autonomous Robotics Lab (PeARL) in UT Computer Science.  He is also a core faculty member in the interdepartmental robotics group here at UT. The goal of Scott\u2019s research is to enable personal robots to be deployed in the home and workplace with minimal intervention by robotics experts.  Toward this goal, he develops machine learning algorithms that allow robots to quickly and robustly characterize new tasks and environments so that well-understood planning and control techniques can be applied automatically.  This work is inherently cross-disciplinary, leading to Scott\u2019s interests in topics spanning manipulation, perception, human-robot interaction, and learning. Applications of Scott\u2019s research have included collaborations with Silicon Valley robotics companies Willow Garage and Bosch, in which he developed algorithms that allowed a robot to learn to assemble IKEA furniture from human demonstrations.  Earlier in his career, his research took him to Chile\u2019s Mars-like Atacama Desert, as part of joint work with NASA, to build a more highly autonomous, science-aware Mars rover. Prior to joining UT Austin, Scott was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, working with Chris Atkeson. He received his Ph.D. in September 2013 from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working under the supervision of Andrew Barto. Dr. Chris Rossbach - Systems Image Ph.D. 2009, The University of Texas at Austin Operating Systems System Architecture Chris Rossbach received his Ph.D. in computer science from The University of Texas at Austin in 2009. Since then, he has worked as a post-doctoral researcher at UT Computer Science and then as a researcher at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley. He then returned to UT Computer Science as a collaborator and will join the UT Computer Science faculty in Spring 2016. Chris\u2019s research focuses on operating system and architectural support for leveraging concurrency. He is interested in concurrency in the very broadest sense, but has a particular affinity for exploring mechanisms that enable systems to take advantage of concurrency to improve performance and mechanisms that simplify the development of parallel programs. Chris\u2019s goal as a teacher is to help students become knowledgeable independent thinkers and researchers. He aims to encourage and challenge his students, foster critical thinking, and pass on the inspiration he received from his own teachers. Most importantly, Chris tries to create an environment in which students can realize that learning concepts and acquire skills that can be a natural side-effect of asking questions that interest them.

HackTX began Saturday at 1 p.m. and concluded Sunday at 11 a.m., after which the teams were judged on innovation, usefulness and creativity. The top 10 teams then presented their work to a panel of technology CEOs and fellow students. Parkhar Garg, co-lead director for HackTX, said HackTX supplements the classroom experience and provides students with a hands-on chance to show what they are capable of. \u201cThe classroom is a lot of theory and computer science and engineering, but this is a place where they can learn something new and use new skills in a practical manner.\u201d Garg said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really about learning, exploring new frameworks and new languages and finding out what you can really do with computer science.\u201d Electrical engineering sophomore Justin Rubio worked with a team of five and said after overcoming initially difficulties, the team was able to finish their drawing software program on time. \u201c[In the program] you could follow the movement across the board and simulate painting and draw various things,\u201d Rubio said. Kaveet Laxmidas, a computer science sophomore from Texas A&M, said HackTX connected students with companies in a meaningful way. \u201cWhen we talk to companies we are primarily looking at what technology they had to offer,\u201d Laxmidas said. \u201cWhen you are working directly with their stuff, they take a certain interest in you because you are using their technology in your own applications. That\u2019s an opportunity to get your resume on the table, and these are companies looking to recruit for internships and jobs. You are meeting a lot of people who can help you in your academic career and your future.\u201d Mahesh Ramchandani, head of core software development at HBK investments, mentored students throughout the hackathon. Ramchandani said he was able to brainstorms with different groups to help develop their ideas further, and once hacking started, said he offered expertise when groups encountered roadblocks and bugs. \u201cThis is an incredible opportunity for students to build something in a short amount of time but also to show off their stuff,\u201d Ramchandani said. \u201cOne thing they never taught us very well in school was how to sell ourselves, but these kids are getting the opportunity not only to build something but to show it off and promote it.\u201d News Categories Events Undergraduate Students Tags HackTX Newsletter-2015-Winter",

    "text_content": "Supporting Women in Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Supporting Women in Computer Science Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 In the past few years, Texas Computer Science students have likely seen an increase in the efforts to support women in computer science. Likewise, the department\u2019s efforts to reach out to the larger community have also grown. There are a number of ways that this has happened, and these efforts have generally been quite successful. The \u201cDream Team\u201d Last spring, the department got a grant from the National Center for Women in Information and Technology (NCWIT), which was funded by Google. Its purpose was to help computer science departments that were interested in recruiting and retention. With this funding, Texas Computer Science hired five students who were informally called the \u201cdream team.\u201d This team spent time communicating with prospective students who had already been admitted into the program over the phone and with Facebook chats. They also invited them to a lunch during Explore UT and set up a visit day in April for the students to meet current students and get a feel for the department. According to Tiffany Buckley, who is the Associate Director for Academics, these efforts \u201cdid help our numbers a little bit this year.\u201d WiCS Women in Computer Science is another way of supporting women at UTCS.  Our department\u2019s WiCS website states that the organization\u2019s mission is to \u201cencourage and support women in computing through outreach, professional development, academic initiatives, and social events.\u201d Buckley explains, \u201cI consider WiCS to be a good retention program \u2013getting students together, offering corporate opportunities and academic opportunities. I think just having that community for women helps them.\u201d Image Grace Hopper Grace Hopper Earlier this month, twenty-four students were also sent to Houston for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. This gathering is hosted by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association of Computing Machinery. It gives students access to three days of plentiful mentoring, networking, educational, collaborative, and other resources. Week With Women Each spring UTCS also has an event called Week With Women. This week includes different opportunities each night centered on inclusiveness, which have varied from speaker events to faculty appreciation dinners where students can invite and spend time with some of their favorite professors. First Bytes First Bytes is a week-long summer camp free to all high school girls interested in computer science who are Texas residents. The program seeks to encourage these girls to pursue STEM fields in college, and scholarships are offered to many students who decide to come to UTCS after they take part in the program. This year, nineteen of the sixty campers decided to major in computer science at UT Austin, and six of these girls were admitted to our Turing Scholars honors program. These rates have nearly doubled since the program began in 2006. There is certainly more that the department would like to do if they had the necessary funding and staff. This ranges from more scholarships given to women, to recruiting trips to high schools throughout Texas. Tiffany Buckley also notes that she would enjoy \u201cbringing all the women in the week before school starts to do a summer \u2018get to know you camp\u2019 or ropes course or something where people can go ahead and start building the community early.\u201d She also explains that she\u2019s \u201creally proud of our women in computer science and our female community here\u2026  everyone is really excited to help each other, to encourage each other, and to build a very welcoming community. I think we\u2019ve hopefully built an inclusive place, and I hope that it will continue to be that way.\u201d News Categories Outreach Tags Grace Hopper Women in Computer Science",

    "text_content": "Near-Perfect Computer Security May Be Surprisingly Close | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Near-Perfect Computer Security May Be Surprisingly Close Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, September 17, 2015 WIRED Magazine | KEVIN HARTNETT |  09.13.15 IN JULY 2013 a pair of studies set the cryptography world on fire. They were posted within days of one another to an online archive where researchers share their work, and together they described a powerful new method for hiding the secrets inside software programs. The method was called \u201cindistinguishability obfuscation,\u201d or IO. The authors touted it as a \u201ccentral hub\u201d for all of cryptography\u2014a unified basis upon which to reconstruct familiar cryptographic tools like public keys and selectively secure signatures. The papers also took a first stab at demonstrating what IO might look like mathematically. The research produced a flurry of interest at the time, but in the two years since the announcement, computer science researchers have encountered a number of practical challenges that stand in the way of using IO. For one thing, IO is extraordinarily slow. Obfuscating a program adds delays that would be measured not in minutes or hours, but in lifetimes. In addition, the method is not nearly as mathematically secure as it needs to be. But in the past few months, a number of studies have provided some of the most important advances since the 2013 announcement. Some researchers now think we could get a working system in a decade, or maybe even sooner than that. \u201cAs of right now it seems like there are no big limitations,\u201d said Amit Sahai, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was a co-author on both of the papers. \u201cIO is powerful and can do almost anything we\u2019ve ever wanted to do.\u201d And if IO can be constructed in terms of certain simple mathematical assumptions, researchers believe that even a quantum computer couldn\u2019t break it.* A Mountain of Small Steps Indistinguishability obfuscation begins by positing two programs that compute the exact same outputs by different methods \u2014 for example, the equivalent functions f(x) = x(a + b) and f(x) = ax + bx. For any set of three inputs\u2014a, b and x\u2014each program produces the same result as the other, but arrives at that result by a different path. IO says that given two equivalent programs, it should be possible to encrypt them so that users cannot tell which version they have, no matter how much they poke around. The 2013 papers convinced many people that IO has the power to dramatically broaden the scope of cryptography. But the studies didn\u2019t specify how to make the idea practical. Researchers have two primary challenges: First, to speed up the process. And second, to ensure that IO is secure. IO would be comically impractical to use today. Any encryption scheme is going to slow down a program at least a little. In the case of IO, the mountain of equations needed to achieve indistinguishability slows things down a lot. \u201cIt probably takes hundreds of years to obfuscate and run a program,\u201d said Vinod Vaikuntanathan, a cryptographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has been heavily involved in IO research. \u201cWhen it becomes that ridiculous you stop caring about the exact numbers.\u201d One general strategy taken by computer scientists to speed up running times has been to reduce obfuscating one large program to obfuscating connected smaller programs. As computer scientists envision it, obfuscating a program would require two steps. Improvements in either step could increase efficiency overall. The first step is the harder one. Current IO methods begin with a so-called \u201cbootstrapping\u201d program that is small enough to obfuscate. This program interacts with the large \u201ctarget\u201d program. The bootstrapping program acts like a secure bubble around the target program\u2019s inputs and outputs\u2014it obfuscates anything that comes in and out of it, effectively obfuscating the target program as a whole. Yet no one has figured out how to efficiently obfuscate even the small bootstrapping program. It\u2019s like trying to find the \u201cfirst chink in the armor,\u201d Sahai said. \u201cThe bootstrapping program is where we\u2019re really stuck.\u201d Researchers have made more progress on the second step. Once the bootstrapping program is in place, the challenge is to obfuscate longer and more varied kinds of computations. At the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) in Portland, Ore., in June, three teams of researchers presented work that demonstrated how to go from obfuscating any single circuit\u2014which researchers already knew how to do in theory\u2014to obfuscating a general-purpose computer (or Turing Machine, in the eyes of theoretical computer scientists). It\u2019s a big leap. In order to obfuscate a circuit, researchers need to know the size of the input and every step in the computation ahead of time. Computers, by contrast, are set up to read arbitrarily long inputs, making additional computations as more data come into view. The work presented at STOC showed how to use a technique called punctured programming to obfuscate these longer, open-ended calculations as a series of discrete, connected, circuit-size steps. \u201cThe main technical achievement applies IO for circuits to the local steps of a computation and ties things together so you are protecting the computation globally,\u201d said Allison Bishop, a computer scientist at Columbia University who co-authored one of the papers presented at STOC. Mathematically Proven Security Making IO more efficient would address a practical problem. Establishing that it\u2019s highly secure would solve a fundamental one. Image Brent Waters, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, demonstrated how IO could be a powerful cryptographic tool. When Sahai and Brent Waters , a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, described a way to use IO in 2013, it was largely a matter of belief that this style of obfuscation would protect the secrets inside a program. Their initial work was kind of like tying a very complicated-looking knot\u2014it might appear very tough to undo, but without really understanding the structure of the knot, it\u2019s hard to be sure there isn\u2019t some simple way of unwinding it. \u201cAt that point there was just a construction, it wasn\u2019t even clear how to argue security,\u201d Vaikuntanathan said. \u201cThere was no clue how to go about it.\u201d The situation has improved since then. Any good cryptography scheme rests on a mathematical foundation that defines the problems the intruder would have to solve in order to break the code. RSA encryption, for example, uses the product of two large prime numbers. To start reading your emails, an intruder would have to work backward from that product and identify the two primes that were multiplied to produce it\u2014a task that\u2019s understood to be impossible given the limits of current computing power. The mathematical assumptions underlying a cryptography scheme need to be hard. They should also be simple, long-tested, and well-understood, so that cryptographers can be confident that a problem is as difficult as it looks. \u201cIt has to be a mathematical problem we can understand. Otherwise experience has taught us that it\u2019s likely to get broken,\u201d Sahai said. In 2013 there were no practical security assumptions behind IO. A year later, in April 2014, Waters, Bishop and Craig Gentry, a research scientist at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., released a pairof papers boiling the problem of IO down to a set of simple assumptions related to a type of mathematical object called multilinear maps. (Sahai was a co-author on one of the papers.) \u201cWe said if the attacker breaks [IO] in any way, he must be solving one of these problems,\u201d Bishop said. Yet multilinear maps were only introduced into cryptography in 2013. Experts haven\u2019t had time to rigorously assess how reliable they are. \u201cRight now, if these multilinear-map candidates got broken, you wouldn\u2019t shock the world,\u201d Waters said. Currently, computer scientists are trying to figure out how to replace multilinear maps with a better-understood mathematical obstacle. The best hope seems to be \u201clearning with errors\u201d (LWE), a problem in machine learning. LWE and multilinear maps share a common mathematical ancestry in a field called lattice-based cryptography, which is why one seems like a good candidate to replace the other. However, no one has figured out how to make the leap. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking across a cliff. It\u2019s so close, it looks like I can jump across it, but that really isn\u2019t the case,\u201d Vaikuntanathan said. The Security Rush Despite the challenges facing IO as a field, experts express confidence that an IO-based security scheme is coming. Sahai points out that the lag time in cryptography from idea to implementation has been as high as 30 years. Given the pace of progress that\u2019s been set in the last two years, he thinks IO could be ready much sooner than that. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to shorten it to 10-15 years,\u201d he said. The major milestone to watch for is the establishment of a simpler mathematical basis for IO security. The most prominent figures in the field think the circumstances are right for IO adoption to move quickly. Bishop said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t bet against\u201d a simple set of hard security assumptions developing in less than a decade. Vaikuntanathan is even more bullish. \u201cI would even go so far as to say a couple years.\u201d The optimism owes in part to all the resources that have flowed into IO research over the last two years. Sahai now serves as the director of the Center for Encrypted Functionalities at UCLA. The center, which is devoted to obfuscation research, was founded in 2014 and is funded by a $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation, with Waters and Bishop as co-principal investigators. Also last fall, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced the creation of SafeWare, a research program that supports the creation of \u201chighly efficient and widely applicable program obfuscation methods with mathematically proven security properties.\u201d The rush to develop IO speaks to its power but also to the cat-and-mouse game intrinsic to cryptography. At the same time that researchers are developing new security strategies, others are hard at work on quantum computers. If and when they arrive, their computing speed will lay waste to most existing cryptographic schemes. Except \u2014 perhaps \u2014 for IO. * Quantum-secure cryptography is a tricky subject; no methods have been proven to be completely secure from quantum-based algorithms.

Most recently, he traveled to New York for recognition at the 2015 Nickelodeon HALO Awards. From giving coats to the homeless, to awarding scholarships, to providing feeding assistance and mobilizing other youth to create change, Comfort and Joy, the organization Cobb started, helps needy Texans and will soon be expanding to other parts of the country. In the last year, Cobb has won both The Root's Young Futurist Award and a Nickelodeon HALO Effect Award. In addition to maintaining his organization and keeping up with his studies, he's also a CNS Ambassador and a member of the College's Council for Diversity Engagement. Over the weekend, Nickelodeon flew Cobb and a guest to New York City to be part of the 2015 HALO Awards ceremony, which recognizes young people who have made a distinct impact through helping and leading others. The program will air on national television on Nov. 29, and Cobb talked with us before the trip. You started a nonprofit that now provides a wide range of assistance to the needy. What's happened with that since you came to UT? We are going national. We have our first national chapter starting in New York City this fall, to be followed by a chapter in Atlanta. The idea is for other kids all over the country to be able to give back, like I did. How does your work in the community tie in with your studies? Technology is an important part. I have to keep a website running, and I plan to provide other kids with technological advice as they run their own sections of Comfort and Joy. What do you see for yourself in the future? I do plan to continue Comfort and Joy. Also, I interned at Google last summer and was offered the software engineering internship to come again next summer. I'm interested in game development because I find it to be a good creative medium. You hear all these negative things about video games, but really there are positives, too. Games increase reaction time and can help with problem solving, reasoning, rationality. These are all things that we'll need in the future to solve the world's greatest problems. Games got me interested in STEM, and I figure they can get other children interested in STEM, too. Where else have your interests taken you? UT is awesome. I am a second-generation Longhorn. My father, Reginald Cobb, got his MBA at McCombs in 1994. I am having the time of my life. I got to go the Tapia Conference in Boston, which celebrates diversity in computer science. It brings together undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, researchers, etc. You can meet people from the industry, get advice, and get your name out there. I was one of only a few freshmen to get to go. Source: CNS News News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags Nicholas Cobb Newsletter-2015-Winter",

The students that put the event on had a bigger goal, of informing the UTCS student body of how diversity can benefit the technology field. The event was put on by the student run organization Minority Alliance in Computer Science or MACS. The goal of the group is to provide a community for anyone who feels underrepresented in computer science. <div> day served as a way for the group to finally get the word out about the cause and raise awarness on the need for diversity for women and different ethnic groups. Image UTCS graduate student and MACS member Juan Sequeda talks to the students about the importance of diversity in the technology field. UTCS graduate student and MACS member Juan Sequeda introduced the event and the guest keynote speaker Goldman Sachs Vice President Tamara Way. Sequeda said that having events and groups like MACS on campus is important in making progress. \"We hope today we will start a community that we can create and foster in our department and across other departments, \" Sequeda said. \"We need to get out of our bubble and start thinking about how we can relate to everyone else. When we do that those are the people that are  going to drive the future of technology and the country.\" The day included a variety of talks led by student leaders across campus and Goldman Sachs employees. All of the topics addressed different issues surrounding diversity in computer science and campus-wide. Some of the talks included the impostor syndrome and how to recognize it, how to navigate a technical work environment, a conversation about achieving diversity in technology, and many more. Head of UTCS, Bruce Porter said that as a computer science community that constantly works toward growth and improvements in technology, that diversity is crucial in continuing growth. \"I want everyone to have the experience to enjoy the feeling of computer science, \" Porter said. \"We have a moral obligation to open up the is field to everyone that has a talent for it. There are barriers, many of which are entrenched, meaning that they\u2019re cultural and can seem hard to change. It\u2019s important that you be a part of breaking down these barriers.

The series is scheduled to continue through March 12. Developed by Google's DeepMind subsidiary, AlphaGo has already beaten the European Go champion . A few days before the latest competition, we asked Risto Miikkulainen , an artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, for his thoughts on this historic contest. Q: So is this just the next inevitable step up from computers that can beat humans at games like chess? It's very different from playing chess. Those other systems were based on old-fashioned artificial intelligence, where you search all the possible moves to find the best ones. Go was always a huge challenge because it has too big of a search space to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time. There are more possible moves than atoms in the universe. So AlphaGo is completely different. Like humans, it uses pattern recognition. Q: Do I hear a bit of admiration in the way you talk about this advance? It's a huge step forward. Until very recently, we thought mastering Go would be decades away. That Google could do it so soon is remarkable and a bit surprising. Q: What kinds of insights were needed to make such a robust program? Google brought together two ideas in artificial intelligence that have actually been around since the 1990s, called Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and deep learning . MCTS is a way of taking a really big search space and narrowing it down to a manageable search. Instead of playing out every possible scenario from start to finish, it tests a random sample of moves and plays them out to maybe 20 moves in the future. Deep learning is similar to the way a human baby learns. Instead of being pre-programmed with a bunch of rules and facts, the program observed many, many games played by human experts and over time, discovered useful patterns. If I were working on this problem, I would have used similar techniques. Q: Do you think AlphaGo will win the series of 5 matches? Whether it wins or loses now doesn't matter, it will ultimately win. If they lose, they will bring in new techniques to make it better. So whether it's next week or next year, they will eventually beat the best humans. Q: Have you placed bets on the competition? AlphaGo won over the European Go champ resoundingly, but the world champion is much stronger. If the match against the European champ had been close, my money would be on the world champion. But it wasn't. I think the most interesting result would be if the matches are very close. It would force people to think, what is the program doing well and what is missing? I think we would make the most progress that way. If it's a lopsided victory, people might think it's all over and there's no need to keep refining it. Q: Besides playing games, what are some real-world applications of this kind of artificial intelligence software? Really any kind of problem that involves very big search spaces and where a pattern-based approach might work. It could help in medical diagnostics. It could help with scheduling and logistics. It might also have applications in image, speech or face recognition.

    "text_content": "Peter Stone: Trinity planners should figure for effects of self-driving cars | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Peter Stone: Trinity planners should figure for effects of self-driving cars Posted by Peter Stone on Sunday, April 12, 2015 By Peter Stone | The Dallas Morning News Image The Horseshoe project and the construction of the Margaret McDermott bridge are taking shape where Interstate 35E crosses the Trinity River. Certain technologies go from being almost unimaginable to commonplace in what seems like the blink of an eye. For example, it was a relatively short time between when microwave ovens were introduced and when they became a standard appliance. Similar changes were brought about by the introduction of refrigerators, televisions, cellphones and personal computers. One of the next technologies that is likely to have similarly large and unforeseen effects is self-driving, or autonomous, cars. When it comes to driverless cars, the question is no longer if but when, and transportation planners ought to be figuring that into projects such as the Trinity toll road. How will autonomous cars change our lives? As a computer science professor at the University of Texas at Austin specializing in artificial intelligence, I have been conducting research on autonomous vehicles since 2003. I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers \u2014 nobody knows for sure \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that we won\u2019t simply treat the cars as driverless versions of our current cars. For one thing, people who are not currently independently mobile will be able to drive. The elderly and the vision-impaired will have increased independence when it comes to transportation, as will children. I\u2019m sure that more than one parent will relish the thought of the children getting to soccer practice on their own. Perhaps more important, far-reaching effects may emerge that affect road project managers and policymakers. My colleagues and I have been actively considering the possible opportunities for reducing traffic congestion, and thus indirectly fuel usage and emissions. At intersections, driverless cars might be able to coordinate so well with one another that cars barely need to decelerate when approaching an intersection, and seldom, if ever, need to stop. The direction of lanes could be changed dynamically on a minute-to-minute time frame based on how many cars are traveling in each direction on a road. Novel pricing mechanisms might make it possible to incentivize more off-peak travel and encourage distribution of trips such that fewer roads get clogged. Similarly, on highways, reliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication could allow for reduced spacing between vehicles and speed harmonization. Advances such as these could significantly increase the capacity of our current roadway infrastructure, some say by as much as 50 percent. Though it\u2019s hard to envision such a change, authorities across Texas would be well-advised to consider all of these possibilities when planning new infrastructure, such as the proposed Trinity Parkway project, in the coming years. Of course, there are many other benefits and questions as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace. If cars can drive themselves, will we still need parking garages downtown? Or will unused cars make their way to parking lots in more remote locations? Will cars even need to park? Car sharing services, such as Car2Go, might become much more appealing if the car can meet you at your trip\u2019s origin. Perhaps many more people will forgo private ownership in favor of car sharing. If drivers don\u2019t need to pay attention when driving, commuting by car may become more like commuting by train, providing extra time for reading or work. Will this effect encourage more people to live farther out in the suburbs since they won\u2019t mind the long commute? During the past few years, Texans along with the rest of the nation have gradually begun to realize that self-driving cars are an impending reality. It is no longer just Hollywood that is considering the potential implications, but now legislators, lobbyists and insurance companies. Although it\u2019s hard to predict the future with driverless cars, I do believe strongly that autonomous cars will be on the market before long; that once they are, they will quickly become commonplace; that they will bring about many changes to our Texas cities, roadways and lifestyles; and that we all must adapt quickly. We will tell our disbelieving children and grandchildren that we remember when cars needed to be driven by people.

    "text_content": "Computer Science vs. Cancer: How Precision Medicine is Turning the Tables on Cancer | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science vs. Cancer: How Precision Medicine is Turning the Tables on Cancer Posted by Moiz Rizvi on Tuesday, November 3, 2015 There are few things as full of anxiety, heartbreak, and anguish as finding out that you or someone you love has cancer. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not at all uncommon. By the American Cancer Society\u2019s estimates it is expected that in the year 2015 alone, there will be 1.6 million new cancer diagnoses and nearly 600,000 deaths\u2014or roughly 1,600 people every day. But statistics are hardly necessary to realize the enormity of the problem. So far, the road to a cure has been long and complicated and with what\u2019s seemed like no end in sight\u2014until recently. After other fields haven\u2019t quite hit the mark, humanity has summoned its most promising contender yet: computer science. Leading part of the charge in the computation diagnosis and treatment of cancer is our very own distinguished faculty member, Dr. Chandrajit Bajaj. Image Texas Computer Science alumni, graduate students, and faculty gathered in the Visualization Laboratory of the Peter O\u2019Donnell, Jr. Building to hear Dr. Bajaj speak on the cross-section of technology and cancer research This past Thursday, Texas Computer Science alumni, graduate students, and faculty gathered in the Visualization Laboratory of the Peter O\u2019Donnell, Jr. Building to hear Dr. Bajaj speak on the cross-section of technology and cancer research. To quantify progress in a relatable way, the fight against cancer was analogized to a football game and the attendees of the talk were introduced right around halftime, when the score looked similar to the score at a Texas game this season. 24 to 3, cancer was up and humanity had a lot of catching up to do. Things weren\u2019t looking so good\u2014that is until the computational sciences stepped in. To level the crowd\u2019s understanding of cancer and provide some background on his work, Bajaj began the talk with a brief overview of what exactly cancer is and some of the open problems that had not been solved by earlier methods \u2013 the most important of which was how each case of cancer was heavily dependent on the individual and how increasing the accuracy and efficacy of diagnosis and treatment would be nearly impossible without more computation. In particular, every case of cancer generally consists of 5 or 6 subtypes of cancer, each sufficiently unique to require special consideration in treatment. An interesting point was made crediting the success of physicists to their devotion to mathematics and imploring biologists to adopt a more mathematically sophisticated approach in their practice. It then followed that if everyone\u2019s case of cancer was different, the way we diagnosed and treated it would need to be dynamic and adaptable and would require a much higher magnitude of mathematical complexity. This idea laid the ground work for what Bajaj called precision medicine\u2014the paradigm shift that is at the core of his work. Image Precision medicine\u2014particularly data-driven precision medicine\u2014involves the usage of data from all facets of an individual, from genome sequencing to lifestyle health metrics to environmental exposure, in the diagnosis and treatment of a disease. Bajaj\u2019s work in data-driven diagnostics was presented as purely computational where ideally no manual decisions would be made. \u201cGiven the right process, the data will speak for itself,\u201d said Bajaj. In making diagnoses more effective, Bajaj\u2019s methods spanned microscopy, spectroscopy, and machine learning in their scope. The process he was focused on involved chemical imaging of examined tissues in order to gather pertinent data with which specialized statistical modeling algorithms could provide smarter insights and predictions in diagnosis . The culmination of the work will eventually be a software suite with which physicians and researchers could perform their own analysis. Aside from his current work, Bajaj described a number of touch downs made by computer science in the fight against cancer in just the last five years, including the availability of enormous databases of \u201chealthy\u201d genomes, the nearly trivial cost of a genome mapping (roughly $100), and the combinatorial specialization of drugs for treatment. As the talk ended and the audience was fast-forwarded to the present, the score was updated to 27-17\u2014cancer was still up, but not by nearly as much. When asked how close we were to curing cancer, he was confident that the pace of progress has certainly accelerated and that if there was a time to be hopeful, it\u2019s now. When pressed for a slightly harder numerical prediction, Bajaj postulated optimistically within a decade. No one knows what the future has in store, but if current trends continue, his prediction may hold. His advice for the next generation of computer scientists who\u2019re up for one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time? \u201cLearn to be part of a team. In all cases, you will be working in teams, so you don\u2019t have to be a renaissance scientist anymore. Adapt to the language of other disciplines\u2014at least enough so that you can play.\u201d The meshing of disciplines has rapidly accelerated our progress. Humanity is counting on this meshing to one day reach the cure.

    "text_content": "Researchers Tackle The Dark Side Of Moore's Law | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Researchers Tackle The Dark Side Of Moore's Law Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, April 15, 2015 This month marks the 50th Anniversary of Moore's Law, an observation that every couple of years, computer chip manufacturers manage to squeeze twice as many transistors onto a computer chip. Because transistors are the tiny on-off switches that perform calculations and temporarily store information, Moore\u2019s Law also embodies the exponential increase in raw computing power that has unleashed a blizzard of tech innovations. Image From the Internet to electronic prosthetic legs to smart phones, many wonderful things became possible because, for decades, each time the number of transistors increased, the resulting chip was faster. But that all changed about a decade ago. As the chips became more and more dense, the more electric power they used and the more heat they generated. An Intel executive predicted in 2001 that, unless something changed, by 2010 chips would be as hot as nuclear reactors. Long before they reach those temperatures, chips cease to function properly. To work around that problem, chip designers throttled back the voltages driving the chips. The net result: Even though chips keep getting denser, the parts that do the calculations\u2014the processors\u2014aren't getting any faster. Chip designers have eeked out modest improvements in processing power, but heat remains a central challenge. Scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin are exploring some clever ways to beat the heat and help make the next great leap in processor speeds. Two innovative projects aim to create low-power transistors and smarter software. Less is Moore Transistors get hot because they use electrons, subatomic particles that carry an electric charge, to perform calculations and transfer information. As electrons flow, they bump into atoms and\u2014just like rubbing two hands together\u2014give off heat. Allan MacDonald, a professor in the Department of Physics, is hunting for a material in which electrons could essentially slide in a group along a slippery path absent friction. \"I try to invent new states of matter,\" he says, \"ones that haven't been studied before.\" Image According to theoretical predictions, these states of matter, called exciton condensates, should be possible to cook up, but so far, no one has found the right recipe. MacDonald is a member of the UT Austin-basedSouth West Academy of Nanoelectronics (SWAN), an industry-funded consortium focused on developing new materials for low-power transistors to replace the traditional ones made of silicon. He uses the tools of quantum physics to predict which materials might have the right properties for a better transistor. Other members of the SWAN team try to create these states of matter and see how well their properties match the predictions. \"At the end of the day, you hope to make an impact,\" says Sanjay Banerjee, professor in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and director of SWAN. \"If I could be part of a team that invented the next transistor, that would be extremely gratifying.\" Another strategy they're trying exploits the fact that electrons don't just carry an electric charge, they also have a spin. Just as a spinning top can go clockwise or counterclockwise, an electron in a magnetic field can have one of two different spins. So instead of the zeros and ones of computer logic being represented by electron charges, they could be represented by electron spins. Because the electrons wouldn't have to flow through an electric circuit, they wouldn't encounter the same frictional forces as they would in traditional transistors and wouldn't generate as much heat. This new class of circuits made using electron spins is known as spintronics. Physicists have found materials with these properties, but turning them into functioning devices has proven devilishly hard. Close Enough Another way to keep computer chips cooler, while getting more work done, is through smarter software. Keshav Pingali, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Institute for Computational Engineering and Science, says that for many applications, computers don't have to be perfectly precise. For example, rendering an image on a cell phone. \"You could render that image precisely, but maybe you could produce an image that looks just as good to the human eye with half the energy,\" says Pingali. \"If your eye can't tell the difference, why bother? It's just a waste of power and energy.\" Other ideas include streamlining Internet search engines so that they produce three or four pages of highly ranked and useful results, plenty for everyday use, without attempting to generate thousands of increasingly less useful results. Pingali and his graduate student Xin Sui are evaluating a dozen computer programs that do a range of tasks, from machine learning to rendering images, in order to find the places where \"close enough\" still gives a good result and significantly cuts energy consumption and heat. Obeying the Law In the late 1970s, IBM was the world leader in manufacturing computer chips. But, thanks to the relentless treadmill of Moore's Law, they were about to run into a brick wall. The technique they used to produce microscopic features on silicon chips involved special chemical films called photoresists. There seemed to be a fundamental lower limit to the size of features like transistors they could create with the technique. C. Grant Willson, professor of chemistry and chemical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and his colleague Jean M.J. Fr\u00e9chet conceived of a workaround called chemically amplified resists. These materials and their descendants helped IBM maintain its edge in chip production for many years. The process is now used to manufacture nearly all of the microprocessors and memory chips in the world. Willson received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2007 and the Japan Prize in 2013. Fast Enough? You might well ask, \"Why should I care if computers keep getting faster? They're fast enough to type documents, play video games and watch streaming videos.\" \"Sure, for these conventional applications, today's computers are fast enough,\" acknowledges Sanjay Banerjee. \"But what people don't realize is that, as you go up the performance curve, new applications become possible.\" He points to efforts to emulate an entire human brain inside a computer, develop automated image-recognition systems, improve weather forecasts and create new medical diagnostics. He also speaks of the \"Internet of Things,\" a vision for the future in which many of the everyday objects around us have the ability to sense the environment, communicate with each other and work together for the benefit of society. Banerjee says these applications\u2014and many more we can't even begin to dream of\u2014will rely on even more compact and speedy computers.

These are just a few of the features available on the new unofficial UT Window\u2019s Phone app, UT Helper. The official UT app is only available for iPhone users, leaving those with android phones to seek alternative methods to quickly have access to all their information within the university system. That\u2019s exactly what inspired UTCS  freshmen Mustafa Taleb to and Melanie Rivera to create an application that would do similar tasks as the official app. \u201c Having to go through their desktop-optimized website is a nightmare on mobile,\u201d Taleb said. \u201cSo in a sense, I made this app to help me get to the information I want faster, but also to help everyone else with a Windows phone to escape that nightmare as well.\u201d Now available through the Windows app store, once downloaded, all that is needed to log in is your UTEID and password. All information that you would find through the web based UT Direct, is accessible right in the palm of your hand thanks to a unique implementation of application programming interface. Image \u201cUT does not offer an official interface for developers to connect to and access the data they want,\u201d Taleb said. As a result, I had to see how they implemented their iOS API by reverse engineering the app. I made my own implementation of the API, and from there we worked, as a team, on the interface and the backend connections.\u201d \u201cI broke out the inner artist in me to design the overall look of the app,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI\u2019ve always had an interest for user interfaces, which I used to help implement the main application page, bandwidth page, food page, and balance page. I also created the UT Helper icon.\u201d In making the app the two worked for two months to finish. Overall 20 hours of coding was put into creating the final product. The work put in by the developers was not just primarily coding, but reliant on design. In the future both developers hope to expand the app to improve the overall efficiency. Currently they are looking into having live icons that update regularly on the homepage. \u201cIt is going to be an ongoing project that we will contribute to every now and then during our time until we graduate.\u201d Taleb said. \u201cExpect more updates, more features, and improvements to the ones that are already there.\u201d",

    "text_content": "Nomadic Computing Speeds Up Big Data Analytics | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Nomadic Computing Speeds Up Big Data Analytics Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, November 4, 2015 University of Texas researcher designs novel way to analyze bigger datasets using supercomputers and machine learning algorithms. How do Netflix or Facebook know which movies you might like or who you might want to be friends with? Here\u2019s a hint: It starts with a few trillion data points and involves some complicated math and a lot of smart computer programming. The ability to make sense of massive amounts of raw data a process known as data analytics has already brought benefits to consumers and longlost friends and is beginning to have a real impact in medicine, law enforcement and public services. Image Professor Inderjit S. Dhillon \u200bInderjit Dhillon, a professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, is a leader in this new world of big data. He was named a 2014 Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to largescale data analytics, machine learning and computational mathematics. \u201cNowadays, there is an abundance of massive networks,\" Dhillon says. \"These networks may be explicit or implicit, and we want to use predictive analytics on these networks to see what they can tell us.\u201d He is among those who have realized it's possible to tame highly complex data (or \u201cdata with high dimensionality,\u201d in the lingo of the field) by using machine learning to reduce data to its most meaningful parameters. His approaches are widely adopted in science and industry. \u201cPeople have come to realize over the last two decades that indeed, data that comes from different applications often has special structures,\u201d Dhillon says. \u201cFor example, in the case of a very high dimensional regression, it\u2019s only a small number of dimensions that may actually matter.\u201d Computing anytime, anywhere Imagine Netflix wants to recommend movies that customers might like based on their ratings. A customer who ranks several buddy comedies highly will probably like other films in that genre. \u201cIf the usermovie matrix was general, there\u2019s no way that you could infer missing elements because they could be anything,\u201d Dhillon says. \u201cBut when you make the assumption that people have a finite number of tastes, or factors that determine what they like, the problem becomes tractable.\u201d In collaboration with Vishy Vishwanath\u2019s group at the University of California Santa Cruz, and with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and computing resources from the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Dhillon and his group have recently developed a new data analysis tool, called NOMAD. It stands for \"nonlocking, stochastic multimachine algorithm for asynchronous and decentralized matrix completion.\" NOMAD can pull insights from data much faster than other current stateoftheart tools. It is also able to explore datasets, including some of the largest available, that break other leading software. Among the problems Dhillon and his team are exploring with NOMAD are \"topic modeling,\" where the system automatically determines the appropriate topics related to billions of documents, and \"recommender systems,\" where, based on millions of users and billions of records, the system can suggest appropriate items to buy or people to meet. In cases like these, fitting the data on a single computer is often impossible. Instead, users distribute data among a large number of host systems. At the heart of NOMAD is a new method for orchestrating computations among those hosts. \u201cSuppose you have a massive computational problem and you need to run it on datasets that do not fit in a computer\u2019s memory,\u201d Dhillon says. \u201cIf you want the answer in a reasonable amount of time, the logical thing to do would be to distribute the computations over different machines.\u201d Easier said than done. Traditionally, systems have managed distributed computations through a process known as bulk synchronization. After computing a solution, each of the processors involved (often thousands) stops and communicates with the others, passing along the results of their computations. In the program that Dhillon and Vishwanathan have developed, the communication is done asynchronously the processors no longer stop and communicate at the same time. \u201cWe are trying to develop an asynchronous method where each parameter is, in a sense, a nomad,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe parameters go to different processors, but instead of synchronizing this computation followed by communication, the nomadic framework does its work whenever a variable is available at a particular processor.\u201d As soon as the work is done, the nomadic parameter travels to another processor. As a result, there is no waiting around for all the other processors in the system to finish computing. Dhillon and his team used the Stampede supercomputer at TACC, the ninth most powerful in the world, and a system called Rustler that specializes in running machine learning algorithms to develop and test NOMAD. Managing the process in this way, the team was able to get a superlinear speedup. That means when they ran the code on one thousand processors, they were able to solve the problem more than one thousand times faster. They were also able to seamlessly handle millions of documents with billions of occurrences of words or millions of users and billions of ratings in a reasonable time period. The team reported their results in the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment in July 2014 and at the World Wide Web conference in May 2015. The research applies broadly to one of the most pressing challenges today, according to Amy Apon, a program director at NSF. \u201cTraditionally, machine learning inference algorithms run on a single large and sometimes expensive server, and this limits the size of the problem that can be addressed,\u201d she says. \u201cThis team has noticed a property of some machine learning algorithms that if a few slowly changing variables can be only occasionally synchronized, then the work can be more easily distributed across different computers. \u201cTheir clever mathematical approach is opening doors to running machine algorithms on the kind of massivescale, distributed, commodity computers that we find in today\u2019s cloud computing environment.\u201d Thinking of genes as a social network When we hear data analytics, we typically think of social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, but Dhillon has applied his tools to a different type of network \u2013 the gene networks involved in disease. Image Big data analysis helps to uncover genes associated with diabetes. Teaming up with Edward Marcotte in the biology department at The University of Texas at Austin, they have applied the methods and stateoftheart algorithms from Dhillon\u2019 s group to the gene networking problems Marcotte is trying to solve. \u201cWe thought about the relationships or linkages between genes and diseases as a network,\u201d Dhillon says. \u201cFrom there, the question is: Can you do prediction from this sort of data to determine what genes have a propensity to be linked to which diseases? And you can do that by actually developing new mathematics.\u201d Marcotte and Dhillon used evolutionary relationships to track down gene networks involved in human health. With this method, they showed it was possible to predict genedisease associations for diabetes based on functional gene associations and genephenotype associations in model organisms. The result of the work was published in PLOS One in 2013, and a further study by Dhillon and his group where they used a similar system appeared in Bioinformatics last year. In October, Dhillon was awarded a three year followup grant from NSF to continue work on nomadic algorithms for machine learning in the cloud, beginning in January 2016. He and his group are now extending their study to medical informatics, where the problem might be to predict comorbidities or the propensity for rehospitalization. \u201cData can tell a thousand stories,\u201d says Dhillon, \u201cand the challenge is to develop new mathematics and methods that can extract the knowledge and discard the spurious. The possibilities are endless.\u201d Image Schematic of the proposed approach to predicting gene-disease associations. News Categories Faculty Research Tags Inderjit Dhillon Newsletter-2015-Winter",

Image If you\u2019ve seen movies like Tangled and the Hobbit you might have been unknowingly exposed to new UT Computer Science Assistant Professor Etienne Vouga . That\u2019s because companies like Disney and Weta Digital have used his work in the study of geometry and physics of every day material. Etienne\u2019s work stems from his interest in computers at a very young age.  He would play computer games, hack them and think of ways to make them better. This interest is what eventually led him to receive his BA in mathematics and computer science from Rice University, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Columbia University. Throughout his education, research played a large role. Etienne specifically studied the geometry of the physics of everyday materials and what causes these materials to react in a certain way. Examples of this include how hair twists and curls, the way cloth wrinkles and folds, and the relationship of a stone building\u2019s shape to its stability. \u201cI study the geometry of these objects and come up with a way to approximate this behavior,\u201d Etienne said.  \u201cFrom there that let\u2019s you translate the physical laws into algorithms on the computers.\u201d His research and the algorithms he has created have been used to make cloth and hair movement look more realistic in films.  His work of a framework for simulating the behavior of cloth under contact was featured in the 2012 Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Research highlights. The research and work he has done prior to his time at UT were leading factors in what drew him to make the decision to be a member of the computer science faculty.  He says specifically that UT\u2019s Institute for Computational and Engineering Science played a part in the decision. \u201cThe resources available at ICES compliment my own research,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cIt is based in computer science and computer graphics but frequently relies on and has applications for computational mechanics engineering and applied math.\u201d Image When Etienne is not teaching students physical simulations for computer graphics, he has been working with ICES to brainstorm the idea of ways to 3D print a human liver. Working with ICES provides the opportunity to have strong collaborations between people of different disciplines to work on solving more problems. In the future Etienne hopes to be able to use his research and his work from UT to be able to give people the tools they need to completely design the world around them. \u201cI think we are moving toward a world where you\u2019ll be able to be in complete control of everything around you and the computer will be able to help you do that.\u201d News Categories Faculty Tags Etienne Vouga",

    "text_content": "Helping Students to Thrive in a Digital World | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Helping Students to Thrive in a Digital World Posted by Chelsey Pena on Wednesday, December 3, 2014 Selecting a college major may be the biggest challenge when going to college. After 12 years of education, students are asked to choose that one specific field that they would like to focus on as a career. In many cases students have little to no exposure to these fields. That\u2019s exactly why UT Computer Science created Project Engage \u2014to provide students with the digital and computational skills they need to succeed in 21st century careers and motivate students to study computer science by offering college credit to high school computer science students. Image The program increases access to computer science in high school, particularly for girls and underrepresented minorities; increases college readiness of Texas high school students; and addresses the shortage of high school computer science teachers in this increasingly popular field. Project Engage achieves its goals by offering school districts the ability to deliver a Computer Science Principles course called, \"Thriving in Our Digital World.\" Unlike lecture-based classes, which relegate students to the role of passive recipients of instruction, the Project Engage curricula uses Project Based Learning, a pedagogy that encourages students to actively learn by solving problems. The course exposes students to big ideas in computer science that exist across disciplinary boundaries while developing many important college readiness skills such as critical thinking, communication skills, and teamwork skills. The course was designed by UT Computer Science faculty and educators through support from the National Science Foundation and UT Austin's dual credit college readiness initiative, OnRamps . Aligned with Texas College and Career Readiness Standards and the expectations of leading research universities, \"Thriving in Our Digital World\" offers high school and community college students the opportunity to adapt to the rigors of college coursework while earning college credit from UT Austin or any other public college in Texas. UTCS Professor Dr. Calvin Lin is a developer of the computer science OnRamps course.  He says that having a program provides an opportunity for students to be introduced to computer science in ways beyond studying for a standardized test. \u201cBefore there were Java courses trying to help students get ready for an AP test, but computer science is so much more than just programming,\u201d Dr. Lin said.  \u201cThis program helps to fill a void. It let\u2019s them create something that has a programming aspect while seeing the technology behind it and all the work that touches so many lives, all before they go to college.\u201d Among students who enrolled full-time in Texas public universities in 2002, 75 percent didn\u2019t earn a degree within four years and 34 percent still hadn\u2019t earned a degree 10 years later.  It is shown that Texas high school students who complete just one dual credit course are nearly twice as likely to complete a college degree. The program's goals of building a more accessible curriculum have been particularly successful among underrepresented groups, where \"Thriving in Our Digital World\" is reaching a more diverse audience than traditional AP computer science. \u201cDual-enrollment has been shown to benefit those who are at risk, to go to college and view it as an abstract thing,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cStudies have shown that if a student takes even one dual-enrollment course, they feel like they can do it and like going to college becomes a less distant thought. They additionally do better in all of their courses.\u201d \"Our country is facing a bit of a crisis,\" said Calvin Lin, professor of computer science at The University of Texas and lead researcher for the project. \"The huge demand for CS graduates in dramatically increasing the demand for high school CS teachers, but at the same time this demand is driving up the salaries for programmers, making it increasingly difficult to attract new CS teachers at the K12 level. We need to find innovative ways to train new CS teachers, including methods that train in-service teachers who are not currently teaching computer science.\" To prepare teachers to offer \"Thriving in Our Digital World,\" Project Engage offers its partners professional development in a summer institute that focuses on both course content and pedagogy. The content ranges from how to teach programming languages like scratch and processing to units on Artificial Intelligence, and modules representing numbers, big data and data mining. These teachers receive ongoing support from an online learning environment and additional professional development throughout the year. Of this year's nine new high school teachers, four have not previously taught computer science before. Westlake High School teacher Paula McKinney, a veteran AP computer science teacher who now partners with Project Engage, commended the impact \"Thriving in Our Digital World\" had on her students, stating: \"I had one student who didn't really know what the course was about and maybe didn't even expect to get anything from it. Her mother recently emailed me and told me that she's really considering this as a career, where she never would have before.\" Just three years ago Project Engage began in five schools in Texas. A year later the program expanded to 11 schools. Currently, the program is being implemented at thirteen Texas high schools, with the goals of eventually scaling this effort to several hundred Texas high schools and replicating the effort in other states through the university's UTeach Institute. \"The lack of computer science courses in high schools is a serious problem, so we're excited to address this issue,\" Lin said. \"We're going to need to do much more, but this is a great start.\" Co-authored by Chelssey Pena and Brent Winkelman.

From strange and exotic algae to trees and flowers growing deep in steamy rainforests to the common plants living in people\u2019s lawns, all plant life on Earth shares over a billion years of history that included the evolution of multicellularity, roots and water-conducting vessels, seeds and flowers. Comparing plant DNA from over one hundred plant species from across the green tree of life, the scientists produced some exciting findings, including that evolution does not always lead to more complex organisms. \u201cWhereas the origin of land plants was facilitated by evolutionary innovations including new cell types and parental care of an embryo, the most closely related group of algae actually evolved simpler body plans [reduced complexity] relative to the ancestors they shared with land plants more than 500 million year ago,\u201d said Jim Leebens-Mack of the University of Georgia, a corresponding author of the paper, published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . In order to reveal their findings, the research team generated millions of gene sequences derived from dozens of plant species, yielding a daunting amount of data. \u201cThe datasets we were analyzing in this study were too big and too challenging for existing statistical methods to handle, and so my student Siavash Mirarab and I developed a new method to produce the species trees described in the paper,\u201d said Tandy Warnow , who was a professor in the UT Department of Computer Science during the study and is now at the University of Illinois. Warnow\u2019s student Mirarab is a graduate student in the College of Natural Sciences and co-lead author of the paper. The method they devised is called ASTRAL and was published earlier this year in the journal Bioinformatics . Mirarab explained why ASTRAL is so special, \u201cAcross the genome there are different genes and every single one of them can have a history that's to some extent different from the next gene, so each gene can have its own tree. ASTRAL looks at all the gene trees for different parts of a genome separately and summarizes them into one tree that describes the evolutionary history of the species as a whole. And when it does that summarization, it takes into account some of the biological processes that are considered important for estimating evolutionary trees.\u201d Even with this new method, analyzing the data required massive computing power. The bulk of Warnow and Mirarab\u2019s work was conducted through UT Austin\u2019s Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and a powerful computing cluster available to computer science students, while other authors made use of the iPlant Collaborative at the University of Arizona, the Compute-Calcul Canada, and China National GeneBank (CNGB). \u201cThis study demonstrates how life scientists are using high performance computing resources to analyze astronomically large datasets to answer fundamental questions that were previously thought to be intractable\u201d, said iPlant\u2019s Naim Matasci. The resources and repositories for the sequence data used in the study are described in a companion paper published in GigaScience . The results of the study\u2019s analyses are helping to settle many longstanding controversies about relationships among major plant groups and illuminate the complex processes that allowed ancient water-faring algae to evolve the structures necessary for vegetation to take root and colonize the land. As plants grew and thrived across the plains, valleys and mountains of Earth\u2019s landscape, rapid changes in their structures gave rise to a myriad of new species. The group\u2019s data also helps scientists better understand the ancestry of more recent plant lineages, including flowering plants and non-flowering cone-bearing plants such as pine trees. Co-lead author Norm Wickett of the Chicago Botanic Garden described the study as \u201clike taking a time machine back to get a glimpse of how ancient algae transitioned into the diverse array of plants we depend on for our food, building materials and critical ecological services.\u201d Ultimately the researchers hope that their project will not only shed new light on the origins and development of plant life, but also provide researchers with a new framework for the study of evolution.

The center is a collaboration among researchers at UCLA, Stanford University, Columbia University, The University of Texas at Austin, and Johns Hopkins University. The goal of the center is to use new encryption methods to make a computer program--and not just its output--invisible to an outside observer, while preserving its functionality--a process known as program obfuscation. Such a technology enhances cybersecurity by hiding vulnerabilities from potential adversaries, thereby preventing tampering and deterring reverse engineering; and by allowing one to hide cryptographic keys within software, thereby strengthening encryption and information transfer. \u201cTraditionally we have thought of encryption as an all or nothing type of primitive where one was either permitted to read data or not. Our aim is to be able to interact with an encrypted program where it is designed to perform some tasks without giving away all secrets, \" said Brent Waters, the principal investigator from the University of Texas at Austin. Amit Sahai, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the lead principal investigator of the project puts it in human terms, stating, \u201cThis question is like asking whether it is possible for someone to keep a secret, if an adversary can see how every neuron in her brain behaves.\" The research developed through the center has major implications for both practical application and the future of academic cryptography. Said Waters, \u201cEncrypted functionalities is an extremely exciting and promising direction, but also one that is at a very early stage. It is very interesting to be at the ground floor and see what this will hopefully blossom into.\u201d NSF awarded two \u201cFrontier\u201d awards as part of a $74.5 million portfolio of more than 225 new projects in 39 states.

Moore\u2019s Law, originally an \u201cobservation\u201d with a time horizon of \u201ca few years\u201d has continued for most of the life of the industry. Today, we can clearly see that the end is near, or perhaps upon us today.  Many deny this, and look for new, killer technologies that will come forward to fill the gap left by the end of Moore\u2019s Law. The popular press is filled with candidates willing to try to fill the role.  Unfortunately, the benefits provided by the new entrants are usually linear, rather than exponential. In this talk, I will not argue in favor of replacement technologies, but instead examine the question of some of the things we can do to continue to improve our computing systems while tolerating the reduction in performance and density improvements that will come as Moore\u2019s Law comes to an end. Chuck Thacker has spent over forty years in several industrial research labs.  He received the BA in physics from U.C. Berkeley in 1967.  He joined Xerox PARC in 1970, where he was responsible for the hardware of a number of innovative systems, including the Alto, the first networked personal computer, and the Ethernet, which is still the most successful local area network.  In 1983, he joined the DEC Systems Research Center, where he was responsible for a number of networking and computing systems, including the AN1 and AN2 networks and the Firefly and Alpha Demonstration Unit multiprocessors. He joined Microsoft in 1997, to help establish the Company's Cambridge, England laboratory.  After returning to the U.S. in 1999, he joined the newly-formed Tablet PC group and managed the design of the first prototypes of this new device.  He has also worked on low-cost computing devices for elementary education, and is currently working in Microsoft Research Silicon Valley. Chuck has published extensively, and holds a number of U.S patents in computer systems and networking.  In 1984, he was awarded (with B. Lampson and R. Taylor) the ACM's Software Systems Award for the development of the Alto.  He holds an Honorary Doctorate from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH).  He is a fellow of the ACM, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, which in 2004 awarded him, (with A. Kay, B Lampson, and R. Taylor) the Charles Stark Draper prize.  In 2007, he received the IEEE John Von Neumann medal, and in 2010, he received the ACM Alan Turing Award.

    "text_content": "Computer Scientists at UT Austin Crack Code for Redrawing Bird Family Tree | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Scientists at UT Austin Crack Code for Redrawing Bird Family Tree Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, December 11, 2014 Image A new computational technique developed at The University of Texas at Austin has enabled an international consortium to produce an avian tree of life that points to the origins of various bird species. A graduate student at the university is a leading author on papers describing the new technique and sharing the consortium\u2019s findings about bird evolution in the journal Science . The results of the four-year effort \u2014 which relied in part on supercomputers at the university's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) \u2014 shed light on the timing of a \"big bang\" in bird evolution, rearrange evolutionary relationships between some bird species and provide new insights on the origins of song pattern recognition in birds, as well as a host of other avian traits. To build the new bird tree of life, researchers first sequenced the complete genomes of 48 living bird species. With about 14,000 genomic regions per species, the size of the data sets and the complexity of analyzing them required a new computing method, which was led by computer scientists Tandy Warnow , an adjunct professor at The University of Texas at Austin and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Siavash Mirarab, a graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin. Previous bird evolutionary trees were based on analyses of a few dozen genes as opposed to this latest study, which analyzed entire bird genomes. Those earlier studies did use more bird species (about 200 compared with 48), but with hundreds of times more genetic data per species in the latest study, the new bird family tree draws from far more data, resulting in some surprising findings such as that flamingoes are more closely related to pigeons than to pelicans and other water birds. \"In the computer science community, we often focus on how to make faster tools to analyze big data sets,\" said Mirarab, co-lead author on one of Science \u2019s major papers about the project. \"This project is exciting because it shows that it's not just about being bigger and faster. Simply having more data doesn't make you more accurate. You have to come up with more intelligent ways to analyze your data.\" By testing the new technique, called statistical binning, on simulated data sets, the team demonstrated that their approach is more accurate than previous techniques. The entire effort to construct an avian evolutionary tree took 400 years of CPU time and required the use of parallel processing supercomputers at TACC, the Munich Supercomputing Center and the San Diego Supercomputing Center. For the statistical binning portion alone, developing and testing the method took over 100 years of CPU time, divided between TACC and the Condor Cluster in the university's Department of Computer Science. \"TACC was essential,\" said Mirarab. \"It's where most of the work on the statistical binning paper was done. We couldn't have done it without these supercomputers.\" Mirarab and Warnow are part of the Avian Phylogenomics Consortium, which has so far involved more than 200 scientists from 80 institutions in 20 countries. The consortium is led by Guojie Zhang of the National Genebank at BGI in China and the University of Copenhagen, Erich D. Jarvis of Duke University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and M. Thomas P. Gilbert of the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Image The group's first findings are being reported nearly simultaneously in 23 papers \u2014 eight in a Dec. 12 special issue of Science and 15 more in Genome Biology , GigaScience and other journals. Mirarab was also co-lead author on a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October that used a different computational technique to reveal important details about key transitions in the evolution of plant life on our planet.

For new UTCS professor I\u015fil Dillig, computer science didn\u2019t cross her mind until her sophomore year in college. Her realization would allow her to obtain her Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and Doctorate all at Stanford University, and eventually lead her to work for UT. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I would end up majoring in computer science,\u201d I\u015fil said. \u201cI took my first programming course at Stanford and discovered that I was attracted to the unique combination of math and engineering that computer science had to offer.\u201d I\u015fil joined UTCS last January, and she has been teaching the freshman honors class CS311H (Discrete Mathematics for CS) this semester. She says that the best part of being a part of the department is the combination of good colleagues and students. Outside of teaching, she focuses on her research in static program analysis, software verification and synthesis, and automated logical reasoning. Within this area, her general goal is to develop tools and techniques to make software systems more reliable, secure, and easier to build. \u201cPrograms unfortunately often crash,\u201d I\u015fil said. \u201cOur goal is to develop techniques to automatically identify program bugs and prevent software from crashing.\u201d One of the projects I\u015fil is currently very excited about is on program synthesis. The goal of the project is to bring programming to the fingertips of non-experts and allow users to automate tasks that would otherwise be too tedious. \u201cWhen you try to Google something it autocompletes, so think of this project as auto complete for programming,\u201d I\u015fil said. \u201cIt will in a way read programmers mind while they are programming and automatically synthesize programs from informal specifications.\u201d Traveling and relocation have played a large role in I\u015fil\u2019s life and career. After leaving California, she worked as an assistant professor at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. She then worked as researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Aside from traveling for work, I\u015fil enjoys traveling leisurely and experiencing different outdoor activities. She specifically likes to hike, explore the outdoors, and scuba dive. Her favorite place that she has been diving was the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. During her travels I\u015fil likes to photograph her adventures. She picked up photography in high school and has been taken photographs ever since. She particularly enjoys taking landscape shots while hiking. In the future, I\u015fil hopes to continue her research on program verification and also work towards the goal of making programming more accessible to end-users. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about the potential of my research to transform the way that most software is built.\u201d",

    "text_content": "Burnt Orange Outreach | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Burnt Orange Outreach Posted by Meghana Chappidi on Thursday, October 22, 2015 The field of computer science is playing a balancing act in our society these days. In some circles, holding a computer science degree immediately brands you as a cool techie who is going to catch the next plane to the promised land that is Silicon Valley. On the other hand, there are still many people who buy into the image of a computer scientist being an antisocial hacker who does genius things with computers. The second stereotype persists because the portrayal of computer science in media has largely remained unchanged for years. The result is that while the enrollment of students in computer science programs is increasing, there is still a part of the population that does not understand what a computer science education entails and the kinds of job opportunities it offers. The lack of awareness is a troubling issue because the world is advancing toward a future where we will become increasingly dependent on technology in all aspects of life and an understanding of computers is a must. Along with the issue of skewed perception, socio-economic barriers and a lack of exposure are other reasons that many people never explore computer science. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas is a part of the effort to provide outreach and work to resolve ameliorate these issues through both student-led and department-led initiatives. Programs and organizations such as UTCS Roadshow and Code Orange offer the public a wealth of information they otherwise might not have access to. Image A Roadshow member speaking to a group of high school students. UTCS Roadshow, an outreach organization, was established by the department several years ago with the purpose of educating children and parents in the local Austin community. The organization, traces its roots back to being a simple presentation service where students visited local K-12 schools and gave thirty minute to one hour presentations to answer three questions: What is Computer Science? Why is Computer Science important? How do you prepare for an education in Computer Science? Over the years, Roadshow has grown from a departmental initiative into a full fledged student organization. Due to popular demand, growing membership, and routine success, recently, Roadshow has been expanding the number of services it offers. First and foremost, the organization is trying to meet the communities thirst for diversifying the presentations they give. Every year, the University of Texas puts on an event called Explore UT, also known as \u201cthe Biggest Open House in Texas\u201d, where UT opens its doors to the public and departments across campus put on various events. Roadshow participated by giving series of successful presentations at various locations in GDC. By far, their most popular talk was one about Game Development. The presentation had been newly added to the Roadshow repertoire. Alvin Deng, one of the presenters, recalls that even though \u201c\u2026it was really nerve-racking\u201d he \u201chad a lot of fun with it and the presentation went really well!\u201d To attest to the success of the presentation, the GDC auditorium was completely packed and unfortunately not everyone could find a seat. Deng mentions that \u201cduring the Q&A session, the audience was really active.\u201d  Spurred by energy and positive feedback from the families that attended, Roadshow is currently working on producing more topic-specific presentations this semester. They are hoping to produce material on in-depth CS topics such as Artificial Intelligence, cross disciplinary topics such as Computational Biology or Computational Chemistry, and more broad topics such as \u201cHow can Computer Science help third-world countries?\u201d Along with presentations, Roadshow members are developing a set of activities in order to better engage young audiences. Currently their most popular activity is a game called Binary Bandit that teaches children about the binary number system using light bulbs (1 is a lit light bulb and 0 is an unlit light bulb). This activity has been put in play at various locations in the past such as Bridgepoint Elementary School and Wonder Lab. Anjie Liang, a leader in Roadshow, retells a time when she was conducting Binary Bandit at an event: \u201cOne little boy was so energetic about learning binary that I ended up teaching him hex too! He spent the next ten minutes practicing hex with me. It was really heartwarming to see someone so young be so excited about computer science. It\u2019s definitely moments like those that remind me how impactful Roadshow can be.\u201d The organization has also visited Meridian School of Science to teach students about conditionals through an activity and show them a PacMan AI demo at the end. As Roadshow gears up for another successful semester of spreading CS knowledge, there is no doubt that they will do a great job of connecting with the Austin community. While UTCS Roadshow is addressing the general issue of a lack of exposure in communities, some UTCS students have recently founded their own outreach organization - Code Orange- to tackle another facet of this problem. Worldwide, there are many communities that do not have access to computer science and tech simply because the families and schools cannot afford to provide that resource for their children. As a result, children from those communities grow up missing out on a set of skills that is fundamental to being successful \u2013 whether that be navigating Microsoft Word or creating the next greatest tech product. Code Orange was founded by three UTCS students: Moiz Rizvi, Danyal Rizvi, and Sohum Chitalia. The idea for the project came in a conversation with a friend who was born and raised in East Austin. He described that children in his community had the perception that they did not belong in the world of tech.  Of course these perceptions are misguided, but without any one to show them that, they would never overcome these feelings. Recognizing this a great opportunity and wanting to work with children specifically, Chitalia, Rizvi, and Rizvi began planning out what would become Code Orange. They were inspired by constructionist education theory, a learning model that emphasizes using projects and activities to instigate knowledge acquisition. \u201cThe program isn\u2019t necessarily about computer science per se\u201d Moiz says, but \u201cThe curriculum is centered around the concept of \u2018creative computing\u2019. It\u2019s a more hands on creative form of educational enrichment that involves fundamental concepts of computing, but focuses on creation, personalization, sharing, and reflection.\u201d Currently, the project\u2019s pilot program, a 6-week creative computing course, started this month at the Pan American Recreation Center in East Austin. Code Orange is beginning by teaching Scratch (a programming language that allows one to create interactive stories, games, and animations) to children of age 10-12 weekly on Fridays. The team has been excited to get their project running, especially after the appreciation they have witnessed coming from the people at the recreation center and other \u201cnon-technical\u201d city employees when they tell them about Code Orange.  In the future, Code Orange plans on fine tuning and revising their process as well as growing course content and spreading to more recreation centers in East Austin. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas is a top-ten ranked institution and is one of the best resources for increasing awareness about computer science education in the Austin area. The two programs discussed are not the only way UTCS students and faculty are engaging the community around them. Programs such as the First Bytes Camp, CS Ambassadors, and other are also tackling the same problem. As the year passes, we can only wait in anticipation to see all the great outreach efforts our wonderful students, faculty, and administration, will be participating in!

    "text_content": "Self-driving Cars Are Right Around the Corner; Then What? | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Self-driving Cars Are Right Around the Corner; Then What? Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, July 21, 2014 By Peter Stone Special to the American-Statesman Image An artificial intelligence-guided car that was developed by UT professor Peter Stone. It is able to pass, unmanned, through intersections safely. Certain technologies go from being almost unimaginable to becoming commonplace in what seems like the blink of an eye. It was a relatively short time between when microwave ovens were introduced and when they became a standard appliance. Entire aisles of grocery stores were re-purposed to accommodate microwaveable food; eating habits changed. People quickly forgot what life was like when food needed to be reheated in the oven or on the stove. Similar changes were brought about by the introduction of refrigerators, televisions, cellphones and personal computers, among other life-changing technologies. When cellphones were introduced, it was tempting to think that they would be used in the same way as traditional phones, only without being tethered to the wall. Few people predicted that cellphones would eliminate the need to plan ahead all the details of when and where to meet a friend. Before they were introduced, it was hard to imagine the impact they would have, but soon afterwards it became hard to remember life without them. One of the next technologies that is likely to have similarly large and unforeseen effects is self-driving cars. It is easy to envision such autonomous cars as simply allowing drivers to safely multitask while \u201cdriving\u201d \u2014 that they will be otherwise quite similar to today\u2019s cars on today\u2019s roads. However, much bigger changes are ahead, and it won\u2019t be long before we no longer remember what life was like when cars had steering wheels. When it comes to autonomous cars, the question is no longer \u201cIf?\u201d but \u201cWhen?\u201d People have long imagined what would happen if cars could drive themselves. For example, the 1980s hit TV show \u201cKnight Rider\u201d was based entirely on the premise. Such shows were seen as science fiction or fantasy \u2014 cars would clearly not drive themselves in the near future. But over the past few years, the general public has gradually begun to realize that self-driving cars are an impending reality. It is no longer just Hollywood that is considering the potential implications, but now legislators, lobbyists, and insurance companies. In fact, most of the necessary technology has existed for more than two decades, including working prototypes. But only recently has it become conceivable that they could be both affordable and safer than human-driven cars. Most car companies are working actively on autonomous cars, and Google has publicized that its autonomous cars have driven more than 700,000 miles without a single accident. As a specialist in artificial intelligence, I have been conducting research on autonomous vehicles since 2003. My students and I have developed new protocols for cars to coordinate movement through intersections that promise to be dramatically more efficient than traffic signals and stop signs when most of the cars are autonomous. We participated in the famous 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge in which fully autonomous cars were demonstrated to be capable of driving in (sub)urban settings, while following the rules of the road. We partnered with Austin Robot Technology, a group of local innovators, to create a car that was able, on its own, to drive correctly at stop signs and in the presence of other traffic. When we began, even our forward-looking colleagues in computer science looked at us incredulously when we said that we thought autonomous cars would eventually become commonplace. Research on autonomous cars was thought to be well ahead of the curve. However, last year we retired the car because of how much progress is being made in industry. It is no longer a topic of futuristic research; autonomous driving is becoming a marketable product. So how will autonomous cars change our lives? Nobody knows for sure. But it\u2019s clear that we won\u2019t simply treat the cars like driverless versions of our current cars. For one thing, people who are not currently independently mobile will be able to \u201cdrive.\u201d The elderly and the vision impaired will have increased independence when it comes to transportation, as will children. I\u2019m sure that more than one parent will relish the thought of the children getting to soccer practice on their own. However, there are many more far-reaching effects that may emerge. Starting with urban planning, if cars can drive themselves, will we still need parking garages downtown? Or will unused cars make their way to parking lots in more remote locations? Will the cars even need to park? Car sharing services such as Car2Go may become much more appealing if the car can meet you at your trip\u2019s origin. Perhaps many more people will forego private ownership in favor of car sharing. If drivers don\u2019t need to pay attention when driving, commuting by car may become more like commuting by train, providing extra time for reading or work. Will this encourage more people to live farther out in the suburbs since they won\u2019t mind the long commute? If so, autonomous cars could actually generate more traffic and congestion. On the other hand, my colleagues and I have been actively considering the opportunities for reducing congestion, and thus indirectly reducing fuel usage and emissions. At intersections, cars may be able to coordinate so finely with one another that they barely need to decelerate when approaching an intersection (and seldom, if ever, need to stop). The direction of lanes could be changed minute-by-minute based on how many cars are travelling in each direction on a road. And novel pricing mechanisms may make it possible to incentivize more off-peak travel, and to encourage distribution of trips so that fewer roads get clogged. Of course all of these changes will need to take place in such a way that the roads remain friendly, or ideally become friendlier, for bicyclists and pedestrians. Even if demonstrated to be safe, will they feel comfortable walking and riding in the presence of autonomous cars, or will we need to build new special lanes, bridges, or tunnels? I don\u2019t know the answers to all of these questions. But I do believe strongly that autonomous cars will be on the market before long; that once they are, they will quickly become commonplace; that they will bring about many changes to our cities, roadways, and lifestyles; and that we will all adapt quickly. We will tell our disbelieving children and grandchildren that we remember when cars needed to be driven by people.

    "text_content": "Computer Scientists Find Mass Extinctions Can Accelerate Evolution | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Scientists Find Mass Extinctions Can Accelerate Evolution Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, August 12, 2015 College of Natural Sciences | By Marc G Airhart Image At the start of the simulation, a biped robot controlled by a computationally evolved brain stands upright on a 16 meter by 16 meter surface. The simulation proceeds until the robot falls or until 15 seconds have elapsed. Image credit \t- Joel Lehman. A computer science team at The University of Texas at Austin has found that robots evolve more quickly and efficiently after a virtual mass extinction modeled after real-life disasters such as the one that killed off the dinosaurs. Beyond its implications for artificial intelligence, the research supports the idea that mass extinctions actually speed up evolution by unleashing new creativity in adaptations. Computer scientists Risto Miikkulainen and Joel Lehman co-authored the study published today in the journal PLOS One, which describes how simulations of mass extinctions promote novel features and abilities in surviving lineages. \"Focused destruction can lead to surprising outcomes,\" said Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at UT Austin. \"Sometimes you have to develop something that seems objectively worse in order to develop the tools you need to get better.\" In biology, mass extinctions are known for being highly destructive, erasing a lot of genetic material from the tree of life. But some evolutionary biologists hypothesize that extinction events actually accelerate evolution by promoting those lineages that are the most evolvable, meaning ones that can quickly create useful new features and abilities. Miikkulainen and Lehman found that, at least with robots, this is the case. For years, computer scientists have used computer algorithms inspired by evolution to train simulated robot brains, called neural networks, to improve at a task from one generation to the next. The UT Austin team's innovation in the latest research was in examining how mass destruction could aid in computational evolution. In computer simulations, they connected neural networks to simulated robotic legs with the goal of evolving a robot that could walk smoothly and stably. As with real evolution, random mutations were introduced through the computational evolution process. The scientists created many different niches so that a wide range of novel features and abilities would come about. After hundreds of generations, a wide range of robotic behaviors had evolved to fill these niches, many of which were not directly useful for walking. Then the researchers randomly killed off the robots in 90 percent of the niches, mimicking a mass extinction. After several such cycles of evolution and extinction, they discovered that the lineages that survived were the most evolvable and, therefore, had the greatest potential to produce new behaviors. Not only that, but overall, better solutions to the task of walking were evolved in simulations with mass extinctions, compared with simulations without them. Practical applications of the research could include the development of robots that can better overcome obstacles (such as robots searching for survivors in earthquake rubble, exploring Mars or navigating a minefield) and human-like game agents. \"This is a good example of how evolution produces great things in indirect, meandering ways,\" explains Lehman, a former postdoctoral researcher in Miikkulainen's lab, now at the IT University of Copenhagen. He and a former student of Miikkulainen's at UT Austin, Kenneth Stanley, recently published a popular science book about evolutionary meandering, \"The Myth of the Objective: Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned.\" \"Even destruction can be leveraged for evolutionary creativity.\" This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health and UT Austin's Freshman Research Initiative. Funding from NSF was provided through grants to BEACON, a multi-university center established to study evolution in action in natural and virtual settings. The University of Texas at Austin is a member of BEACON. Evolutionary biologists in BEACON assisted Miikkulainen and Lehman in designing the research project and interpreting the results.

They all have incredibly impressive credentials and research experience, and we\u2019re extremely grateful that they have chosen to join our family. We encourage you to learn more about our new faculty and extend a warm Longhorns welcome when you see them on campus. I\u015fil Dillig - Assistant Professor Image Ph.D. 2011, Stanford Program Analysis Programming Langauges Automated Logical Reasoning I\u015fil Dillig is a graduate of Stanford University, where she received her Ph.D. in computer science in 2011. After completing her Ph.D., I\u015fil worked as an assistant professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and later as a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK. I\u015fil\u2019s research interests include program analysis, programming languages, and automated logical reasoning. The main goal of her research is to make software systems more reliable, secure, and easier to build in a robust way. Her recent research has addressed scalable techniques for static reasoning about pointers, path- and context-sensitive analysis, container data structures, the interplay between over- and under-approximations of program behavior, and constraint solving and simplification techniques that enable more efficient analysis algorithms. Thomas Dillig - Assistant Professor Image Ph.D. 2012, Stanford Program Verification Automatic Constraint Solving Thomas Dillig received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2012, with a dissertation on \u201cA Modular and Symbolic Approach to Static Program Analysis.\u201d Previously he was an assistant professor at the College of William & Mary and a senior lecturer at University College London. Tom\u2019s main research interests are program verification and automatic constraint solving. The end goal of his work is to develop new techniques to build reliable and provably correct software systems and make costly program errors a thing of the past. Tom has worked on several software projects, including SAIL and SATURN. SAIL is a front-end for program analysis systems that provides a two-level representation, consisting of both a language-specific high-level intermediate language as well as a low-level, language-independent representation. SATURN is a program analysis system. The goal of the Saturn project is to statically and automatically verify properties of large (meaning multi-million line) software systems. Eric Price - Assistant Professor Image Ph.D. 2013, MIT Sparse Recovery Compressive Sensing Sparse Fourier Sampling Eric Price completed his graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving a Ph.D. in computer science in 2013. Since then, he has been a postdoctoral research fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing and the IBM Almaden Research Center. Eric's research focuses on making the Fast Fourier Transform, one of the most fundamental algorithms in a variety of disciplines, even faster. Eric\u2019s thesis shows how the sparsity of the Fast Fourier Transform can lead to substantially faster algorithms. Eric\u2019s research was featured in Technology Review\u2019s TR10 list of 10 breakthrough technologies of 2012, and his thesis was a recipient of the George M. Sprowls award for best doctoral thesis in computer science at MIT. Eric also co-created NewsDiffs, which tracks post-publication changes to online news articles. Almost half of all news articles are silently changed after being posted online, and NewsDiffs provides a way to reference old versions and see the changes that have occurred. NewsDiffs has been cited several times by the New York Times to reference old versions of its own articles. Etienne Vouga - Assistant Professor Image Ph.D. Columbia University 2012 Computer Graphics Applied Mathematics The Geometry of Physics Etienne Vouga earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2012, where he researched physical simulation as part of Columbia University\u2019s Computer Graphics Group. He is now spending one year as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, working in L. Mahadevan\u2019s Applied Mathematics Group. He will join UT Computer Science as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2014. Etienne studies the geometry of the physics of everyday materials\u2014how hair twists and curls, the way cloth wrinkles and folds when it is wrung out or balled up, and the relationship of a stone building\u2019s shape to its stability. By blending computer science, applied physics, geometry, and numerical methods, he turns insights about the geometry of these materials into more accurate and efficient computer algorithms for simulating them, and for interactively designing objects built from these materials that takes into account not only the intended form but also the intended function. Special effects studios Disney and Weta Digital have used Etienne\u2019s work on cloth and hair simulation in movies such as Tangled and The Hobbit. He was awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in applied mathematics for the year 2013-2014, and his work on Asynchronous Contact Mechanics, a framework for simulating the behavior of cloth under contact, was featured in the 2012 Communications of the ACM Research Highlights.

    "text_content": "CS Entrepreneurs Pioneer the Most Diverse Hackathon in Texas | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content CS Entrepreneurs Pioneer the Most Diverse Hackathon in Texas Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, January 17, 2014 Glancing across the room of the Student Activity Center during the HackTX hackathon, I saw a melting pot of students of varying genders and ethnicities passionately working together huddled around a hodgepodge of electronic devices. While I was already impressed with the diversity I could see on the surface, that was only part of the story, as talking to them revealed that many of these students came from different majors and even different universities across the country. I had the opportunity to meet fellow students ranging from UT electrical engineering majors to Rice University CS students to a student who flew in from Brigham Young University in Utah. Organizer Taylor Barnett says, \u201cWe had students from Rice, Baylor, UT Dallas, UT San Antonio, UT Pan American, Texas A&M, Penn, MIT, and more.\u201d This diversity is a deliberate effort, as she writes that \u201cI noticed at last year\u2019s event there  were very few females. This year I was really trying to encourage more women to feel welcome and participate. I\u2019m excited to say we increased female participation by four times.\u201d Despite its deep reach into such diverse groups of students, HackTX is only a fledgling idea in its second year. Like the event itself brings together a community of various majors, the idea was put in motion in 2012 by a combination effort of Vivek Karuturi, a CS undergraduate student who co-founded Hacker Lounge, Michael Akilian, a now-graduated EE major, and members++ of the interdisciplinary Technology Entrepreneurship Society. Image According to Vivek, the idea came about when \u201cwe realized that there was a void in the university where the community of builders and engineers weren\u2019t really connected in the way we envisioned. We didn\u2019t really see a place at UT where the community could come together to do something together.\u201d Image So, living up to their entrepreneurship orientation, they set out to create this missing community with HackTX, and encountered immediate success with over 200 participants. Speculating on why UT Austin could have such a far-reaching touch to so many students both inside and outside of UT, organizer Stephen Wan notes that \u201cAustin has an excellent and growing technology scene that doesn\u2019t quite exist anywhere else in Texas. A lot of other schools in the state have pockets of the builders, hackers, and entrepreneurs we\u2019re targeting, but simply don\u2019t have the community, both University-wide and city-wide - we\u2019re trying to bridge that gap across Texas.\u201d Image The 2013 event was born out by the continuing combined effort of Hacker Lounge and the Technology Entrepreneurship Society, most notably Vivek Karuturi and Taylor Barnett, CS undergraduates, and Stephen Wan, an electrical engineering major. According to Taylor, this year\u2019s event had double the students of the initial 2012 event, and the group has big dreams to continue this rapid expansion into HackTX 2014. According to Vivek, \u201cthe future of HackTX involves a more diverse group of people and skillsets. This year we had initially tried to incorporate design and art students into the event with their own specific set of challenges and prizes but we scrapped it due to time constraints. We\u2019d love to encourage things like that at UT and get designers more exposure as well as connect them with the HackTX community more than ever before.\u201d News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags HackTX Stephen Wan Taylor Barnett Vivek Karaturi",

This year, we have around 1800 students in the Class of 2017, making computer science one of the largest majors in the College of Natural Science. There are a lot of reasons why. The fact that one of the most competitive categories at UIL\u2014a competition prevalent in many public high schools\u2014is computer science turns the minds of thousands of high schoolers towards CS in general. Our collective fascination of Silicon Valley has led to a manifest destiny-esque romanticization of the field of startups. Projects like The Hour of Code and websites like codeacademy.org are making CS more accessible to students who just want to learn. The problem, though, is that in most cases, middle and high schools don\u2019t actually offer that many CS-related courses. Most high schools stop at data structures, while many don\u2019t offer any CS classes at all. With the exception of the most advanced ones, middle schools basically don\u2019t offer a computer science education at all. As a result, a lot of students never hear about computer science as anything more than what the stereotypically nerdy guy does in every spy movie ever. UTCS is trying to change that, however, with UTCS Roadshow , a program dedicated to educating students all over Austin about computer science. Two or three CS majors\u2014anyone from freshmen to seniors\u2014go on trips to different schools around Austin to give short presentations on computer science, usually with a few activities to get students thinking along the lines of computer science. For example, most trips feature a game called \u201cCracking the Code\u201d, where the nefarious Cookie Bandit has stolen several packs of cookies; the safety of the cookies is incumbent upon the students reversing a series of letters encoded in binary or hexadecimal. Image The goal isn\u2019t to start teaching kids Java or Python; in fact, it\u2019s as nontechnical as an introduction as you can get. Though, it does teach binary and hexadecimal. It\u2019s designed to get them thinking about what it means to be a computer scientist; the presentation includes slides that talk about all of the different companies CS majors intern or work for, the different types of research UT\u2019s CS department does, and the If you are a UTCS undergraduate student are interested in volunteering to take your passion for CS to Austin middle school students, visit the UTCS Roadshow page.

The integrated programs are modeled after an existing program offered by UT Computer Science in which students earn both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the field of computer science. \"The department is thrilled to offer these new five-year programs to our students. Pairing a bachelor\u2019s in Computer Science with a master's in Information Studies or Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics will allow students to broaden their technical knowledge and specialize in areas that are extremely relevant in the expanding world of technology,\" says Tiffany Grady, Associate Director of Academics for UT Computer Science. Students in the program will be able to complete the integrated program in five academic years of full-time study\u2014one year less than it would take to complete the two degrees individually and consecutively. Students can begin applying for these programs in spring 2015 and the programs will begin fall 2015. Computer Science and Information Studies Five-Year Integrated Program UT Computer Science and School of Information are launching an integrated five-year program leading to two degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and the Master of Science in Information Studies (MSInfoStds). \"This program is ideal for students who want to broaden their CS background to include design, user experience and policy studies. I have talked with many companies who are looking for graduates with this background,\" explains Bruce Porter, Chair and Professor for UT Computer Science. Graduates of the program will be uniquely qualified for professional positions that require diverse perspectives on information, leadership, and technical depth such as human-computer interaction design, user experience design, information architecture, and the design, development, and management of digital services in governmental, academic, or corporate institutions, as well as for competitive Ph.D. programs in computer science and information studies. Computer Sciences and Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics Five-year Integrated Program UT Computer Science and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) are introducing an integrated five-year program leading to the simultaneous awarding of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and the Master of Science in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics (MSCSEM) degrees. While the BSCS degree program prepares undergraduate students with a strong foundation in computing, the master\u2019s degree program in CSEM complements CS\u2019s focus on data with a strong emphasis on mathematics, scientific computing, and applications of computing to real-world problems. \"Computer science is an essential technology for all areas of science and engineering, and this program is ideal for students who want to deepen their understanding of mathematics, scientific computing, modeling and simulation,\" says Porter. As computing moves into the mainstream, successful developers and managers must understand the applications of computing to a diverse set of problems, and the underlying algorithms that are the basis for numerical analysis. The BSCS/CSEM Integrated Program will provide students with a well-rounded education enabling them to not only understand the fundamental science of computing, but how computing is used to tackle challenging problems, leading to careers in such fields as computational and mathematical modeling.",

Image CS Ambassadors are undergraduate students who organize and lead visits to the Department of Computer Science (UTCS) for high school juniors and seniors who are considering pursuing a CS degree. Ambassador visits include a tour of the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall (GDC), lunch with a student Ambassador, a meeting with a department advisor, attendance in an entry-level CS course, and a meeting with a faculty member. More than 60 high school students spent the day with UTCS through the Ambassador program during the fall and spring semesters of the 2012-2013 school year. Said one attendee of her time with CS Ambassadors: \u201cI can't stop talking about it! It was so helpful to have so many people who WANT me to be in the program. Many other tours I have taken just want to show off the school, but the Ambassadors at UT made me feel like I should really go there.\u201d The key to the success is the CS Ambassador program is the Ambassadors themselves. They are truly \u201cambassadors\u201d for the Department, warmly welcoming future students to the department. Their sincere and candid interactions with families help high school students and their parents make informed decisions about next steps after high school. \u201cI believe that you are doing really well with making the prospective students feel welcomed and at ease. I was most impressed that I got every single question I had prepared answered,\u201d explained one high school student who participated this year. Ambassadors are a diverse group of students who represent a broad range of the CS students. Ambassadors must have completed one year in UTCS, meet a GPA requirement, and participate in a competitive interview process to join the program. They receive training and shadow experienced Ambassadors prior to leading their own visits. The entire Ambassador team meets twice monthly to share experiences and participate in ongoing training. Leaders in the Ambassador program arrange the visits, manage communications with potential students and their families, coordinate with faculty members, assign Ambassadors to visitors based on the students\u2019 interests, and gather feedback from the families that participate. There is tremendous interest in GDC, and the role of the Ambassadors has grown with the department\u2019s move into it. Ambassadors led building tours throughout the opening event. (One Ambassador, who led Bill Gates on a tour of the building, wrote about her experiences for Forbes.com .) Since the move into the new space, Ambassadors have led group tours during events such as Explore UT, for high school computer science teachers and their classes, and for organizations such as UT LAMP and the Texas Exes. More than 20 CS students served as Ambassadors over last school year, providing a valuable resource to UTCS. One student who visited decided to not only to apply to UTCS, but left with additional plans for college: \u201cI'm definitely thinking of becoming an Ambassador when I get to UT... I'm glad I made the trip!\u201d",

Story by Cason Hunwick for the College of Natural Science's news page . Joydeep Biswas leads the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory (AMRL) at UT, where he and other researchers work on building mobile service robots that assist humans in everyday environments. The lab investigates programs and algorithms that enable these robots to better navigate changing conditions, incorporate human assistance and recover from failures intelligently. Biswas has extensive experience building and programming self-navigating bots. He built a self-balancing robot reminiscent of Star Wars, coached a team of high-speed soccer-playing bots and most recently developed race cars that execute coordinated high-speed maneuvers. We met with Biswas to discuss his academic career, robotics research and his thoughts on how the future of robotics may involve humans and robots working together. Image Professor Joydeep Biswas Tell me about some of your early robotics projects at IIT Bombay. What did you learn from those? As an undergraduate at IIT Bombay, I was exposed to this whole new world of robotics where it wasn't just building a physical thing \u2013 these are physical things which can actually move in an environment and interact with people. That was mind-blowing to me. After completing your Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon and a position as an assistant professor at UMass Amherst, what brought you to Texas? The fact that robotics is a big focus of research here. There is also significant support from the department, the college, the university and other sponsors to grow this area and do ambitious things. And there's the new building, the Anna Hiss gym, which is being renovated and a large part of the space over there will be for robotics. We're looking forward to deploying all of our robots in the new space. In fact, I've been working with the architects and the building managers to put in electronics so that our robots can wirelessly request elevators in the building. For my undergraduate project, I decided that I wanted to build a single-wheel balancing robot. The particular mechanism which I chose is what's called a reaction wheel. There's a heavy brass disc inside combined with sensors that can detect whether the robot is falling to the left or to the right and spin the disc the opposite direction to right the robot. I also designed it such that this entire system was enclosed in a transparent, self-contained hub. The control systems that you use to balance this kind of single wheel robot are similar to what you would use on the BB8 droid (from Star Wars). Tell me about your lab and what you're working on. The goal for the group that I lead here, called the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory, is to enable long-term autonomy for mobile robots. Our question is: How can we have robots exhibit mobility in challenging environments, such as cluttered homes or in dense human crowds, over extended periods of time? One problem is having these robots effectively navigate around in your home to do tasks. Say I have a video call with my mom via the robot. Can the robot effectively and smoothly follow me around as I move from the kitchen to the living room? This is extremely challenging because homes are cluttered environments that change over time. Robots don't know how to deal with this change. Another challenge is that robots are inevitably going to make mistakes, like humans do. How can they understand what their mistakes are? How can they understand when their perception algorithms are going to fail? That would allow them to understand that something they perceive is likely to make them do the wrong thing. The final thing is how can robots take corrections from humans? For example, you see a soccer-playing robot that has an open angle to the goal, and it's just not kicking the ball. You don't know why it's not shooting. There's something wrong with the program. But guess what, everybody in the audience knows what the correction is. They are yelling at the robot: shoot! shoot! So how do you take this as the correction and automatically fix whatever is broken with the robot? What kinds of robots do you work with? We have a couple of different types of robots. And they all exhibit different types of behaviors and capabilities, which make them really good at different tasks. We have approximately human-scale robots that can navigate both indoors and outdoors. We hope that soon you will see them roaming around the UT campus. Then we have smaller robots, like our one-tenth scale racecars. The cool thing about those platforms is that they're highly performant \u2013 they can travel at very high speeds, but they have limited onboard computation and sensing, which poses an interesting challenge to autonomy. We can push the capabilities of our system in terms of high-speed behaviors, without having to carry a large burden of risk. There's an Explore UT event where the race cars will be on display. What can people expect to see if they visit this exhibition? These mini race cars are already being used in an undergraduate course I'm teaching called Autonomous Driving. It's essentially an intro to robotics class where teams of students get to keep a car to themselves for the semester, and over the course of the semester, they get to make this car fully autonomous and be capable of moving around in our environments. If you come to Explore UT, you'll actually get to see these race-car robots zooming around on our track. UPDATE: Explore UT 2020 has been canceled.

Through this lecture series, faculty presented insights into computer science research and education to the public and the computing community. Kristen Grauman \"Teaching Computers to Recognize Visual Categories\" Image Watch Kristen's Lecture ! Abstract: Widespread sensors and unprecedented connectivity have left us awash with visual data---from online photo collections, home videos, news footage, medical images, or surveillance feeds.  Currently human attention is needed to interpret most of it, and computer users are accustomed to primitive search mechanisms based on keywords.  However, to make visual data truly accessible, computer systems must be able to automatically recognize objects and activities in images and video.  How can we teach visual concepts to a computer?  Our work indicates that it requires not only advanced statistical models, but also interactive learning methods that bring human \u201cteachers\u201d into the loop, and semantic representations that can couple data-driven patterns with rich high-level knowledge.  I will highlight some recent results, and discuss visual recognition's ties to big data, crowdsourcing, and broader artificial intelligence. Speaker Biography: Kristen Grauman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.  Her research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on visual search and object recognition.  Before joining UT-Austin in 2007, she received her Ph.D. in the EECS department at MIT, in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  She is an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow and Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellow, a recipient of NSF CAREER and ONR Young Investigator awards, the Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award from the University of Texas System in 2012, the PAMI Young Researcher Award in 2013, and the 2013 Computers and Thought Award from the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  She and her collaborators were recognized with the CVPR Best Student Paper Award in 2008 for their work on hashing algorithms for large-scale image retrieval, and the Marr Best Paper Prize at ICCV in 2011 for their work on modeling relative visual attributes. Brent Waters \"New Frontiers in Cryptography\" Image Watch Brent's Lecture ! Abstract: Cryptography is the art of protecting information that is not physically secure. Cryptography is used everyday in computing applications ranging  from secure web sessions to authenticated software updates. While these traditional applications view cryptographic data as being inert, there has recently been a surge in the research community for computing on cryptographic data. Recently, our capabilities have changed dramatically in this area. We now have cryptographic systems for fully homomorphic  encryption, functional encryption, and code obfuscation ---  all of which seemed very implausible as little as five years ago. In this talk I will introduce these topics and some of my recent research in the area. Speaker Biography: Dr. Brent Waters received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2004. From 2004-2005, he was a post-doctoral at Stanford University then worked at SRI as a Computer Scientist. In 2008 he joined the faculty at The University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Waters' research interests are in the areas of cryptography computer security. His work has focused on Identity-Based Cryptography, Functional Encryption, and code obfuscation. He has award and invited papers. He is noted as a founder of Functional Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption. Dr. Waters both publishes and has served on the program committees of the top technical security venues (CRYPTO, Eurocrypt, ACM CCS, Usenix Security and the IEEE Conference on Security and Privacy).

    "text_content": "Finding New Gene-disease Connections the Facebook Way | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Finding New Gene-disease Connections the Facebook Way Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, July 29, 2013 Original story by Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences Image Social networking finds us friends we never would have met off-line, and products we never would have heard of. LinkedIn connects professionals, Facebook connects friends, and applications like Spotify and Pandora connects us with our music. Now, there\u2019s a network for connecting genes and diseases. Inspired by social networking methods, researchers at The University of Texas\u2019 Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) have developed techniques for discovering connections between genes and the diseases they may influence, like diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. The techniques outperformed all current genetic linkage tests on the market, and uncovered potential new genes of interest for a variety of diseases. The research results were published in May in the online and open-access journal PLOS ONE. Common Ground Image Inderjit Dhillon is a computer science professor who studies social network analysis. And Edward Marcotte is a professor in chemistry and biochemistry looking for collections of genes shared across species with the goal of identifying potential disease genes in humans. When the two professors met a year and half ago at a presentation, and got to talking, they found that they were working toward the same goal. \u201cAs we started talking we realized that both of us were basically trying to predict missing links,\u201d said Dhillon, who won the the 2013 ICES Distinguished Research Award . \u201cIn social networking analysis, it could be between people, or between people and the groups they might belong to or want to join. Whereas, in [Marcotte\u2019s work], the goal is to predict, as of yet, undiscovered links between genes and diseases.\u201d Dhillon and Marcotte, and their respective research teams, decided to combined forces to create the first \u201csocial network\u201d for genes and associated phenotypes, with a focus on finding genes associated with human diseases. The network is built on a collection of hundreds of thousands of known human gene-to-gene interactions, integrated with thousands of gene-phenotype associations that Marcotte compiled from humans and an array of other organisms, including zebra fish, fruit flies, bacteria, yeast, and even plants. Although the network is designed to look for human disease genes, including genes from non-human organisms in the network is a smart move because of the shared genetic history between all life. Identifying shared clusters of genes in different species and their phenotypes can help locate potential disease genes in humans, even if those genes have a seemingly unrelated effect in other organisms. Research that Marcotte published in 2010 made this point clear, finding, among other connections, that the same cluster of genes that influence cell wall repair in yeast aids in blood vessel growth in humans. The research was profiled by renowned science writer Carl Zimmer in The New York Times . The genes that are shared or connected between disparate species and phenotypes is one of the most striking and important features of of Dhillon and Marcotte's network map. Mice, plants, and people Image Finding genes that might influence a disease required the whole network to be scanned for gene-disease connections, and the connections to be ranked. This system is based on a \"guilt-by-assocation\" approach that suggests new connections based on previously known connections between genes, and between genes and diseases.mic It\u2019s a method akin to Facebook scanning its huge database of users for common interests to come up with a selection of \u201cfriend suggestions,\u201d said Dhillon. A network map included in the research is arranged around diabetes. It\u2019s a web of known connections between genes, genes and phenotypes, and the resulting predicted connections. Included in the network are genes and phenotypes from humans, mice and plants. \u201cYou can think of diabetes like an interest group, and the gene AVPR2 as a person,\u201d said Dhillon, referring to a gene related to kidney function in mice included on the graph. In this map, amongst known connections across various species, two new gene predictions are highlighted as being potentially important to diabetes based on known connections: AQPI, a gene that influences mouse kidney function, and MYBL2, a gene that influences response to salt stress in plants. \u201cSo the gene AQPI might be linked to diabetes as there are multiple paths [in the gene-phenotype network that suggest this connection.\u201d From Computers to the Cinic Diabetes is just one disease that Marcotte and Dhillon investigated with this method in the study. Known gene connections were confirmed, and new potential disease genes found for leukemia, prostate cancer, schizophrenia, and breast cancer, among other conditions. Dhillon and his research group developed two state-of-the-art machine learning methods to find connections and make gene-phenotype predictions: Katz and Catapult. Both methods identify common genes and associated phenotypes across organisms and rank their likelihood of contributing to a defined disease. But they analyze the data in slightly different ways, with each method having its own networking strengths. Catapult is good at recovering gene-disease associations that are already known, adding further evidence to support current knowledge. Katz on the other hand, is better at finding associations between diseases and genes that have not been studied well, but make biological sense. For example, a top Alzheimer\u2019s Disease prediction by Katz includes BDKRB2, a gene that is highly expressed in the central nervous system, and associated experimentally with high levels of beta amyloid protein, the main component of plaques often found in the brains of those with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. \u201cBoth of the algorithm properties can be very useful in different situations. We therefore decided to present both [in the paper],\u201d said Martin Singh-Blom, a former post-doctoral researcher in Marcotte\u2019s lab and lead author in the research paper. Image Both methods also outperformed current gene-disease prediction methods, with Katz having more than a 15 percent probability of recovering a gene in the top 100 predictions for a disease. PRINCE, another gene-phenotype linking method used widely in research, has only a 5 percent probability. Having a new tool to help tie genes to diseases is invaluable for geneticists, said Singh-Blom, and also for the development of genetic tests used by doctors for serious diseases. \u201cAngelina Jolie\u2019s recent mastectomy is an example of the benefit this kind of knowledge has given us,\u201d said Singh-Blom, referring to the preventative surgery the actress underwent after genetic tests revealed she carried a variant of the BRCA1 gene strongly associated with breast cancer. \u201cBy improving our knowledge of how mutations in genes cause diseases we can improve our ability to assess the risks and benefits of preemptive treatments like that.\u201d Article by Monica Kortsha News Categories Faculty Research Tags Inderjit Dhillon social network analysis",

PennApps is a student-run hackathon committed to the idea that college students can create the technology of the future. At PennApps Spring 2013, which took place over the weekend of January 18 th at the University of Pennsylvania, over 450 creative college students from some of the nation\u2019s top schools worked for 40 hours straight to build hacks and compete for the grand prizes. Some notable hacks from this year include a backpack that keeps track of your belongings, a Facebook application that \u201ccleans\u201d your profile, and a toilet that tweets. Image University of Texas sophomores Sai Avala (CS), Suvamsh Shivaprasad (CS), Sourabh Shirhatti (computer engineering), and Ankit Tandon (computer engineering) competed together in the competition. Their work, which was inspired by the coffee machine in the UT Flawn Academic Center, involved hacking a coffee machine to make it voice controlled through an Android app they developed. They called their app Mrs. Coffee, \u201cthe perfect compliment to your Mr. Coffee coffee maker.\u201d Aside from being voice controlled, Mrs. Coffee also texts or emails the user when their coffee is ready. A bonus feature the team added makes the coffee strong or weak depending on how the user\u2019s company\u2019s stock is doing. SendGrid, a sponsor of the competition, chose Mrs. Coffee as the \u201cBest SendGrid Hack\u201d and awarded the team a Lego Mindstorm NXT 2.0 Kit. Congratulations to the team for their success!

That\u2019s the central theme behind developing his Galois software system that turns sequential computer code into parallel code. It\u2019s a highly technical research program. But it\u2019s a philosophy too, complete with sacred texts, disciples, and plans for evangelizing its methods throughout the programming community. Welcome to what Pingali jokingly calls the church of Galois. Parallel worlds The Galois system was developed to automatically take serial code\u2014code meant to be executed in sequential order by a single processor\u00ac\u2014and enable it to run in parallel on multi-processor computers. But why would someone want to run a computer program in parallel in the first place? In short, it\u2019s often the only way to efficiently analyze information in the world of \u201cbig data.\u201d The multiple processors of parallel systems enable faster run times and permit more data to be analyzed. It\u2019s no surprise that climate researchers, geophysicists, and finance companies are among the top users of parallel systems. Galois\u2019 foundational research paper, \u201cThe Tao of Parallelism in Algorithms,\u201d outlines a way for serial programs to be executed in parallel: apply the Galois software to release the parallel \u201cessence\u201d hidden within serially defined code, using a method Pingali calls \u201cTao-analysis.\u201d The paper was published in 2011 in the Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation. All the programmer must do is indicate which parts of the program should be run in parallel, and organize his or her code to use data structures that are recognizable to the Galois system. And if \u201cparallel essence\u201d sounds a little obtuse when talking about something as scripted as computer code, know that it\u2019s supposed to be. There is technical and computational logic that supports the transformation from serial to parallel, but it is, at its root, amorphous and hard to define in simple rules. In fact, Pingali ends the Tao with a quote from the Ashtavarka Gita, a classical Hindu scripture written around 500 BCE, emphasizing its undefined nature: \u201cThat which has form is not real; only the amorphous endures. When you understand this, you will not return to illusion.\" Still, for those interested in the technical side of the Tao, its computational structure is outlined in the text and Galois is free for anyone to download . Reading the Graph Image Tao-analysis seeks to expose the structure of algorithms to determine how they can be executed in parallel. Traditional high-performance computing (HPC) algorithms are known as \u201cregular\u201d algorithms because the parallelism in these algorithms in independent of run time, and can be found before the program is executed. Then, there are \u201cirregular\u201d algorithms. The parallel nature in these algorithms is much more slippery, shifting depending on the data inputs, and making it so that the parallelism must be uncovered during program execution. Galois can handle both because it defines regular algorithms as a special case of irregulars. And that\u2019s an important feature of the system because irregular algorithms are the driving force behind the growing field of graph applications. These programs analyze data by evaluating connections between entities to identify relationships. These connections then inform the system how to act. Graph applications are behind Facebook\u2019s friend recommendation system, and what song Pandora will choose to include in a playlist. IBM\u2019s artificial intelligent system Watson used graphical reasoning to win Jeopardy! in 2011. The immense amount of data available nowadays (think of the 1.11 billion of users on Facebook, or websites pulled up by a search engine) makes parallel computing systems the logical choice for processing graph applications. But that doesn\u2019t mean the future will belong to parallel programmers. \u201cOne school of thought says that since computers are parallel, all programmers have to be parallel programmers. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reasonable idea,\u201d said Pingali, explaining that the split-processing nature of parallel computers is far from intuitive. Most programmers will not be able to write effective parallel programs, said Pingali. \u201cHuman beings find it very hard to think in terms of doing things in parallel. We multitask, but we really only do one thing at a time.\u201d Instead, he says Galois is a better method to make parallel systems\u2014and all their speed and computing power\u2014 accessible to all programmers. \u201cA small number of expert parallel programmers should support a very large number of [general] programmers who don\u2019t have to write in parallel,\u201d said Pingali. \u201cThe Galois system is making this model work in the relatively complex domain of these graph programs.\u201d Galois on tour Image This summer Pingali will be receiving the Distinguished Alumnus Award from his undergraduate alma mater The Indian Institute of Technology Kampur. It\u2019s the university\u2019s highest award for alumni. The award acknowledges achievements such as Pingali\u2019s past work being incorporated into products by Intel, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, and Digital Equipment Corporation. Pingali says he is pushing for Galois to be next on the list for adoption and adaptation by researchers and industry. To help make that happen, Pingali and his students are spending the summer spreading the word of Galois near and far, and in different ways. Pingali, by hosting a group of Polish researchers at ICES who will apply Galois to their own computational codes, and his students by taking Galois and its Tao to technology firms through internships. Hosting interns is chance for companies to get to know the Galois approach up close, and optimize it for their systems. And that\u2019s the first step toward taking the approach from research to market, said Pingali. \u201cThe point of doing research in academia is doing something that\u2019s kind of far out or risky. And once you\u2019ve established that this thing is actually a feasible idea, others like to look at that software, take it apart and write their own version of it,\u201d said Pingali. \u201cIt takes awhile for any idea, especially if it\u2019s an idea that\u2019s different from what most people are pursuing, to get to the point where it\u2019s accepted.\u201d Pingali speaks from experience. He says it took about five or six years for his earlier software that optimized computer processor cache usage to be incorporated by companies. Now it\u2019s standard practice. With the need for parallel programs expanding across industry and research, it\u2019s prime time for people to start converting, their code that is, and joining Pingali\u2019s \u201cchurch of Galois.\u201d Article and photos by Monica Kortsha News Categories Faculty Research Tags Keshav Pingali",

CEO, John Donahoe paid a visit to The University of Texas of Austin last Thursday as an installment of the VIP lecture series, co-hosted by the Department of Computer Science and the McCombs School of Business . eBay is a company that has experienced a significant turnaround under Donahoe\u2019s leadership. Its fast-growing Austin office now numbers 600 employees, most of whom are in the company\u2019s PayPal division. Speaking to a 400 person audience, Donahoe and his interviewer, Associate Dean David Platt , explored a range of topics, including the future of mobile payment and the challenges of running a technology company as a non-technologist. Ken Hicks, the CEO of Foot Locker, Inc. and previous VIP guest speaker, submitted a video question for Donahoe inquiring how traditional brick and mortar sellers should address the growing influence of online retailers. Prior to the lecture, Donahoe connected with students and faculty in the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall (GDC) in a series of roundtables in which participants asked Donahoe about his career and and research areas of mutual interest to eBay, Inc. and the Department of Computer Science. Visual search emerged as a common thread among the various discussions. Multiple people, including Assistant Professor Kristen Grauman , who specializes in the field of computer vision, noted that the future of online shopping likely includes the option of taking a snap shot of a favorite dress or a pair of sneakers with your phone and using the photo to search retailer inventories for a more precise product match than word-based searches can currently produce. As a parting gift, McCombs student Charles Adkins presented Mr. Donahoe with a traditional University of Texas branded Stetson cowboy hat.",

Teams from all over the state traveled to compete in the open format contest. In addition to local Austin area schools, there were entries from Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Lubbock, Weslaco, Blanco, Buna, Andrews, and Port Aransas. Students began the day with a tour of the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall (GDC) and demos from Freshman Research (FRI) Initiative students. The computer science competition itself consisted of an individual written test in the morning and a team-programming contest in the afternoon. Teams of three students tackled twelve programming problems, trying to solve as many of them as possible in the two-hour time limit. About 60 UTCS students volunteered to help with building tours, a quadcopter demonstration, judging and grading, and various other duties. Robert Mitchell of Cypress Ranch High School, Andrew Liu of Cypress Woods High School, Michael Lopiccolo of William P. Clement High School, and Tres of Seven Lakes High School all tied for first place on the written exam in the large school division. Each student missed only one of 40 questions over Java programming, algorithms and data structures. The small school winner was Paras Arora of Harmony Science Academy North Austin 1. The team of Raymond Chee, Michael Li, and Michael Lopiccolo of William P. Clements High School achieved the highest programming score during the afternoon competition. The team solved 12 of the 12 programming problems. Team members combined written scores and their programming score to determine overall results. In the large school division (high school classifications of 4A and 5A), the team of Raymond Chee, Michael Li, and Michael Lopiccolo from William P. Clements High School took first place honors with a score of 1,400 out of possible 1,440. The team is coached by their computer science teacher, Lubna Lorena. Originally, William P. Clements high school was on the waitlist. Michael Scott explained, \"Their teacher, Lubna Lorena told me to call, no matter how late, if a spot opened up, that they would be there. We had a cancellation at 4pm on Friday January 31\u2014less than 16 hours before the contest start time! I called Lubna expecting her to say, thanks but no thanks. Instead she said \"We will be there.\" She had obtained permission from her principle to attend if a spot did open up; she and her students were actually practicing in her room when I called. They drove up from Houston Saturday morning and their first team won the contest.\" The small school division (high school classifications of 1A, 2A, and 3A) was led by the team of Cameron Egger, Austin Mager, and William Schodek. They are coached by Delta McFarland, the computer science teacher at Needville High Schoo l . UIL sponsors and coordinates high school academic competitions in 22 areas including computer science. High school students compete in a series of open and invitational contests in the fall and winter, and then attempt to qualify for the state competition via district and regional contests.

The fifth annual Demo Day, held Dec. 5, had a packed house in the LBJ Auditorium to hear a conversation between Cuban and Bob Metcalfe , professor of innovation at the Cockrell School of Engineering and director of Longhorn Startup. RetailMeNot CEO Cotter Cunningham also took the stage, and 14 student startups made presentations. \u201cThe difference here from Shark Tank is that you have to have sales,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBut other than that, I would say some of the pitches I saw here tonight were better than ones I\u2019ve seen on Shark Tank.\u201d Cuban discussed his past experiences with business, from his teenage years when he sold stamps to his current ownership of the Dallas Mavericks, reported The Daily Texan . He also gave advice to entrepreneurs. Biomedical engineering senior Ani Sharma told The Daily Texan that through the Longhorn Startup Program he learned what it takes to put together and commercialize a product. \u201cI want to hear the feedback people give me as we look to move our business forward,\u201d he said. At Demo Day, Sharma presented the startup MicroMulsion, a new technology for cell culture research. During the semester, Longhorn Startup Lab students not only work on developing their startups (which they must already have in progress before applying to the program), they also participate in lecture series and networking events, as well as receive hands-on mentoring from hand-picked entrepreneurs and experts.

    "text_content": "A New Curriculum for a New Marketplace | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content A New Curriculum for a New Marketplace Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, December 7, 2012 In June, 2011 the New York Times published an article that prompted a conversation on whether the field of computer science (CS) was experiencing a Sputnik moment. The debate was a response to a nationwide surge in computer science enrollment\u2014a trend that has shown no signs of abating in the 18 months since. Image In 2006, The University of Texas at Austin housed 818 computer science majors. Six years later that number has more than doubled, exceeding 1,700 students and bringing the department very nearly back to dot.com era enrollment. This rising tide of CS majors is indicative of more than a response to increased demand from employers, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics certainly suggests that a computer science degree is an excellent way to outflank the sluggish job market. The surge can as likely be credited to the fact that evolving technologies are making a social impact in direct, unprecedented ways. While this may be most apparent in consumer technologies such as social media and smartphones, huge and highly visible changes are also occurring in streaming media, autonomous and computer-assisted vehicles, instantaneous natural language translation, battlefield robotics (think drones), and any number of other areas that excite the imaginations of huge numbers of college-bound students searching for their place in tomorrow\u2019s work force. Simply put, today's students are being drawn to a breed of computer science that comes equipped with a supercharged cool factor and career possibilities for its practitioners that are seemingly limitless. The challenge for the universities responsible for preparing students for these careers is that the days of a one-size-fits-all computer science education are over. With rich and complex fields like big data, information security, and game design all requiring intensive study in their own right, it isn\u2019t realistic to ask students to complete a uniform battery of required courses and expect that they will be well equipped for the diverse array of career options that await them. How then to structure a curriculum to tackle a field that is not only diverse but rapidly evolving? This question was fortunately anticipated more than a decade ago by the Association of Computing Machinery, which put forth a series of curricular reforms aimed at getting universities to build degree plans that were inherently more responsive to a field marked by rapid evolution. For the first time this fall, UT Austin has put many of those recommendations into place. The old curriculum demanded that students take a long list of courses from all topic areas deemed to be of major significance, leaving them little room for electives or specialization. The new curriculum flips that concept on its head, establishing only a minimal core deemed critical to anyone obtaining a computer science degree. Students now take two courses each in programming, systems, and theory, leaving them free to complete the majority of their studies in coursework specific to their interests and career plans. The expected result is that the department will graduate alumni better prepared to respond to today\u2019s job market. In tandem with this overhaul, the department has also launched a series of targeted, optional concentrations that will provide interested students with a high degree of specialization in key fields. The first of these, the INFOSEC program , certifies students who want to intensively study cybersecurity and privacy. Reflecting the improved alignment with market demand, students graduating from INFOSEC who choose to work in government labs and agencies focusing on cybersecurity regularly receive a $10,000 starting salary bump. A similar industry-friendly focus can be found in the game development program, where computer science has partnered with faculty and practitioners in fine arts and radio-television-film to offer students an interdisciplinary curriculum centered on training high-demand creative technologists. The program incorporates a capstone course that establishes deliverables built around team-structured, real-world modeled game design and development. As students take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new curriculum, enrollment in coursework in other in-demand areas like big data and cloud computing is expected to grow, and additional areas of concentration areas are sure to follow. Only time will tell if this rush of students into computer science marks the Sputnik moment some are claiming, but there is one fact we already know. The original Sputnik moment was born out of the threat of being challenged and a fear of falling behind. Our moment is one marked by a more organic excitement\u2014an excitement born out of the enormous potential for technological advancement and growth that has become available to a generation of students uniquely well positioned to understand how technology and their personal contributions can make a direct impact on the world in which we live. Our goal at The University of Texas at Austin is to make sure we have given them every opportunity to capitalize on that potential. News Categories Undergraduate Students Undergraduate Program",

Image Professor Robert van de Geijn Van de Geijn\u2019s research involves using linear algebra\u2014the core of scientific computing\u2014to understand and improve how software runs on high-performance computers. \u201cWe look at the patterns in the algorithms that make up software and study the science, the system behind those algorithms,\u201d van de Geijn said. \u201cHigh performance is the goal because people would be upset if we ran on the big machines at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at a fraction of their peak performance.\u201d These linear algebra libraries choose algorithms that are best suited for running on a given high-performance computer to make other programs run faster and use less energy. These features make them useful to industry and research alike. The approach also has the benefit of generating programs that are mathematically proven to be correct, said Maggie Myers , van de Geijn\u2019s wife and a lecturer in UTCS. \u201cJust like you mathematically prove a theorem correct, you prove the program correct,\u201d van de Geijn added. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the creation of the proof that gives you the program.\u201d The computing industry, including Intel, HP, Texas Instruments, Movidius, and AMD, uses libraries developed by van de Geijn and his research group to improve their own products. Timothy Mattson, a senior principal engineer at Intel, says that efficient computers depend on having linear algebra libraries that run quickly. To make sure Intel\u2019s libraries are up to speed, they compare them with van de Geijn\u2019s. \u201cBasically, we come out with a new release of our math libraries, Robert would beat them with his own [libraries], and then our math library group would figure out what he did and update our software,\u201d Mattison said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a healthy rivalry over the year.\u201d Improving efficiency is good for business, but it\u2019s also vital for computational research. Devin Matthews, a post-doctoral researcher working with van de Geijn and UT chemistry professor John Stanton, is using the BLIS linear algebra library to develop codes that describe chemical reactions at the quantum level. An important part of this work is computing tensor contractions, an operation that is fundamental to calculations of the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of molecules. \u201cIt turns out you can take certain pieces of it and substitute it out, one piece here, one piece there, and you go straight to tensor contraction,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a direct and very visible benefit to chemistry there. What people were doing before took thousands and thousands of lines of code.\u201d In 2013 van de Geijn and Myers started bringing linear algebra research to larger audience through their MOOC, or massive open online course. The course, \u201c Linear Algebra\u2014Foundations to Frontiers ,\u201d has been taught once a year since 2013. The goal of the course is to teach people how the mathematics of linear algebra relates to how algorithms can be programmed. \u201cWe really wanted to teach people how to program for correctness, which is what our research is all about. So I viewed this first MOOC that we created as a step toward that,\u201d van de Geijn said. Creating the class was a huge undertaking that involved writing a 900-page textbook and filming 270 video lectures. It was an effort that involved the whole family, van de Geijn said. \u201cWe spent Christmas here. It was a family affair and an unreal amount of work,\u201d van de Geijn said. But the effort paid off. The class has 4.5 out of 5 stars on edX, the online platform where the classes are offered, and the page is full of positive reviews. One in particular sums up the qualities that the Peter O\u2019Donnell Distinguished Research Award seeks to recognize. It reads: \u201cThis course was so amazing, excellent motivation, presentation and exercises (to get insights and intuition). The staff was very active in the discussion forum. This course was like a dream, this was a free high quality education. Really guys I don't know how to thank you, you should so proud for what you offer.\"",

    "text_content": "The UT^2 Game Bot Judged More Human Than Humans | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The UT^2 Game Bot Judged More Human Than Humans Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, August 14, 2012 The UT^2 game bot, created by Jacob Schrum, Igor Karpov, and Professor Risto Miikkulainen, won the Humanlike Bot Competition at the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2012). \u201cThe idea of the competition is to evaluate how we can make game bots, non-player characters (NPCs) controlled by AI algorithms, appear as human as possible,\u201d explains Risto. \u201cIt is generally recognized that NPCs are relatively weak in most video games: their behavior is predictable and mechanical, and they often make mistakes that human players would be unlikely to make. Players often enjoy playing against other humans, because it provides a more interesting game experience. The goal of the competition is to promote more research in human-like bots, as well as evaluate how well we are currently doing in this area.\" Image The Humanlike Bot Competition focuses on interactions in the Unreal Tournament 2004 videogame, which is a fast-paced first-person shooter game. There are complex 3D environments in which multiple players and bots battle each other with different weapons and abilities. Humanlike behavior involves actions like moving around in the 3D space, engaging opponents, and choosing weapons. The UTCS team has participated in all six competitions since 2008. Over time, their bot design has changed significantly. To help guide their research and improvements, they ran a human subject study to determine what human judges base their decisions on. The winning entry consisted of a prioritized list of behaviors such as getting unstuck, shooting at the enemy, picking up an object, and running around the environment. The simplest of these behaviors were designed by hand, as scripts, but the most complex behaviors were learned using human traces and neuroevolution. Image The getting-unstuck and running-around behaviors were based on traces of actual human behavior. The team collected transcripts of many games, and indexed and stored them. During the game, when a getting-unstuck or running-around behavior is called for, they matched the current situation with the database and executed behaviors that humans found appropriate in similar situations. The general idea was to learn to map these two behaviors from situations to human actions that would then apply to novel situations as well. The battle behavior was learned using neuroevolution. Neural networks were used to control the movement, weapon selection, and shooting during close combat with an opponent. Instead of training the network using human behavior as targets, the team used evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms) to search for a network that would perform well. \u201cIn this case we found that a network that was evolved to be good also acted much like humans do, so a secondary objective of being similar to recorded human traces was not necessary,\u201d explains Risto. Image The UT^2 bot is the first winning bot in the history of the Humanlike Bot Competition to be judged as human more often than half the human players participating in the evaluation. \u201cThat is a significant milestone in the competition,\u201d says Risto. While in the first several competitions, there was a persistent gap between all humans and all bots, that gap has now closed. \u201cThere is still much we can improve, and the competition will continue, with the next one scheduled for later this year.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Faculty Graduate Students Tags Artificial Intelligence game bots Humanlike Bot Competition IEEE Igor Karpov Jacob Schrum Risto Miikkulainen",

    "text_content": "Gates Opens Building, Talks Health | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Gates Opens Building, Talks Health Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, March 7, 2013 Gates Opens Building, Talks Health | KNOW In a speech Wednesday to an audience of computer science students, Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , offered his vision of how the computing revolution will dramatically improve human well-being in the next few decades. Gates was on campus for the opening of the new Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex , a 140,000-square-foot, $120 million complex for the university\u2019s top-10 ranked Department of Computer Science . The complex was funded in substantial part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation also contributed significantly to the complex. Image Following a ribbon-cutting ceremony, in which Gates was joined by an artificially intelligent robot, he spoke to a group of computer science students and faculty. \u201cIf I had a choice to be a student at the time I was, when the idea of personal computing and the internet were being created, or today, I\u2019m not sure which era I would choose,\u201d said Gates. \u201cCertainly in terms of the impact on the world, it is the era that we\u2019re in right now, building on all that previous work, that is going to be the most exciting.\u201d Gates focused in particular on how computing will affect two of the primary projects of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: fighting infectious disease in the developing world and improving and democratizing education. \u201cThe question is how do we take these extraordinary advances so that they\u2019re not just benefitting those who are doing well, in places like the United States, but the entire globe. How do we take advances in domains like health, sanitation, agriculture and finance and make them affordable and usable for everyone, so that we are lifting up the living conditions of those who are often invisible to us, who in some ways should be our highest priority,\u201d he said. Gates gave as an example the work that University of Texas at Austin computer science professor Chandrajit Bajaj has done creating three-dimensional models of where the HIV molecule might be vulnerable to vaccines. He also discussed a project the Gates Foundation launched to develop a better epidemiological model for malaria, which is the number one killer of children in the developing world. \u201cThe model used up until recently didn\u2019t capture the richness of the disease,\u201d said Gates. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough to answer the key question, which is: Can we go in with drugs and bednets and insecticides and actually help whole countries where lots of children die of malaria? Will that work or not? In a sense this is a software problem, and one that we\u2019re now much more able to solve.\u201d On the topic of education, Gates said that we\u2019re just at the beginning of understanding how technology will change instruction. Image \u201cOf course you use tools like Microsoft Word to write papers, and you look up facts on Wikipedia,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in terms of the actual delivery of instruction and the personalization of that instruction, the promise is all in front of us.\u201d He pointed to the success of the online tutorial site Khan Academy as an example of the kinds of solutions that will emerge. Gates said that he expects that it is the students of today who will create the new tools that will enable the most transformational changes. \u201cI envy you being in computer science today,\u201d he said. In response to this challenge, and in recognition of the Gates Foundation\u2019s contribution to the new computer science complex, the College of Natural Sciences honored Gates by dedicating to him a new \u201cresearch stream\u201d in its pioneering Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). The new stream, called DIY Disease Diagnostics, will honor the Foundation\u2019s work in global public health by deploying undergraduates to develop novel, cheap, point-of-care disease diagnostics for the developing world.

After an off year in SPL last year, Austin Villa made it back to the quarterfinals this year, where they lost a close game to a team from the University of Chile (2-0). UNSW from Australia repeated as champions. The students and postdocs who contributed include Katie Genter, Jake Menashe, Josiah Hannah, Sanmit Narvekar, Ruohan Zhang, Elad Liebman and Jivko Sinapov. In the 3D simulation league, Austin Villa defended their championship from last year, making it now four out of the past five years that they've won.  This year, they won all 19 games they played, scoring 87 goals and conceding one. They also won all three challenge events, that are designed to emphasize new technical challenges (the free/scientific challenge which is based on a conference-like presentation, the kicking accuracy challenge, and the drop-in player challenge). The lead student on the project is Patrick MacAlpine, who published 2 papers based on his RoboCup-related work at AAAI this past year: UT Austin Villa 2014: RoboCup 3D Simulation League Champion via Overlapping Layered Learning and SCRAM: Scalable Collision-avoiding Role Assignment with Minimal-makespan for Formational Positioning .

At UT Computer Science, however, First Bytes is working to change this by reaching out to girls at a time when their career paths are still somewhat undecided. Established eleven years ago, First Bytes is a one-week camp for high school girls designed to ignite enthusiasm for computer science and dispel myths about the field that keep women from participating. Image Over the course of the week, campers are given a lab project that allows them to apply the computer science concepts they are learning. In the past, some of these have included Lego Mindstorms, digital animation and creating games. Program coordinator Mary Esther Middleton says that today\u2019s campers tend to come in with a little bit more tech knowledge than in the past, so they have been able to assign more challenging projects. This year, campers will learn to use C++ and create a light show by controlling LED lights. First Bytes is funded partially by donations from companies that make an effort to connect with the girls at the camp. For instance, Amanda Nunez, connected with Amazon through First Bytes and later ended up working for them. The camp is also free to Texas residents, giving some girls an opportunity that they may not have had otherwise. Amanda and her sister Ashley Nunez are among the many former campers who have later gone back to help run the camp. UT students can apply in the springtime ( and the application is currently open ) to be either residential assistants or program assistants. Not all students involved are computer science majors, but most are majoring in a related field such as math, science, or engineering. The camp encouraged many former campers, like Ashley, to become UTCS students. Nunez explains, \u201cFirst Bytes not only introduced me to many paths and projects available to those who are in computer science, but it also gave me the opportunity to meet many of my peers who I would work with coming into computer science and some truly fantastic mentors.\u201d When the program first started, only a couple of campers typically joined UTCS as students each year, but enrollment numbers have been gradually increasing. Middleton explains, \u201cWe\u2019re getting the message across that you can do a lot with a computer science degree, and so they seem a little more focused now, or maybe we\u2019re better at selecting the ones [campers] that we think will be interested, too.\u201d UTCS enrolled its first 3 campers in 2006. Between 2007-2010 UTCS was accepting between three and seven campers each year. In 2013, this number grew to 13.And, the number of campers joining UTCS just keeps growing, with next fall reaching a new record of 15 campers slated to become UTCS students. Middleton, who is a UTCS alumna herself, says that the biggest thing she wants girls to take away from the program is that with computer science \u201cyou can touch on so many different roles in so many different careers\u2026 if they want to go into a business type application development, if they want to go into a medical field, a research field, all these things require some computer knowledge and they can have fun doing it and make a big difference.\u201d She emphasized, however, that at the end of the day, the camp is about teaching girls to focus on something that they\u2019re passionate about\u2014 be it computer science or otherwise.

    "text_content": "Research Corner: Computational Drug Discovery | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Research Corner: Computational Drug Discovery Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, April 30, 2012 Discoveries in bioinformatics provide new therapeutic interventions to disease by replacing expensive, time-consuming physical experiments with an automated computational search. Public databases now contain experimentally determined sequence and structural information for hundreds of thousands of proteins allowing for rather comprehensive digital investigation. Computational software and hardware limitations are the restricting factor in obtaining deeper understanding of molecular function from this available data. Computational development of future drugs and treatments involves many tools for processing, searching, and simulating these large databases. Improvements are clearly needed to develop a core library of algorithms underpinning the computational prediction and virtual screening for scientific discovery. As available computer systems are constantly changing in various forms and factors, these algorithms must be efficiently mapped to emerging architectures to continue to tackle problems of increased realism and significance. Image Molecular sequence and structural information come from a variety of experimental apparatus, gene arrays, x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron and even light microscopy. Multiple experimental sources are important because methods which yield the highest-resolution views of molecular structures typically do not reflect function or behavior in natural environments. From multiple, often somewhat inconsistent, experimental datasets, geometric models of essential molecular assemblies are reconstructed. After producing a structural model of a critical biomolecular target (wild type and synthetic mutations), a search is performed for each target using a database of potential drug molecules to determine several candidates for whom binding is most effective and likely. The choice and models of the target, the choice and search through appropriate drug databases, and the selection of the top leads for druggability all require massive computational analysis and assessment of sequence structure and function interactions including effective methods for visualizing the proposed solutions and interactively tuning the optimization process. Computational leads are finally tested in laboratory experiments and further verified using microscopy. CVC research on drug discovery spans this computational drug discovery pipeline. This begins with improved tools for reconstructing accurate structural models from x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy data. With these structural models, computationally efficient biochemical/physiological models for estimating the interaction between molecules and/or chemical compounds are being enhanced to more accurately reflect the true binding affinities. These models are integrated into fast search algorithms for identifying the minimum energy binding configurations of a target with a proposed drug. Underneath these specific challenges in computational biophysics and biochemistry are more fundamental issues in computational science including the fast Fourier transform, the fast multipole method, and variational methods for solving inverse problems. To harness modern computing, these algorithms are designed to be cache aware and optimally mapped to heterogeneous mutli-core CPU and many-core GPU architectures.

    "text_content": "The Emerging Revolution in Game Theory | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Emerging Revolution in Game Theory Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, October 16, 2012 [Originally published on The Physics arXiv Blog , MIT Technology Review] Image William Press The world of game theory is currently on fire. In May, Freeman Dyson at Princeton University and William Press at the University of Texas announced that they had discovered a previously unknown strategy for the game of prisoner\u2019s dilemma which guarantees one player a better outcome than the other. That\u2019s a monumental surprise. Theorists have studied Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma for decades, using it as a model for the emergence of co-operation in nature. This work has had a profound impact on disciplines such as economics, evolutionary biology and, of course, game theory itself. The new result will have impact in all these areas and more. The game is this: imagine Alice and Bob have committed a crime and are arrested. The police offer each one a deal\u2013snitch and you go free while your friend does 6 months in jail. If both Alice and Bob snitch, they both get 3 months in jail. If they both remain silent, they both get one month in jail for a lesser offence. What should Alice and Bob do? If they co-operate, they both spend only one month in jail. Nevertheless, in a single game, the best strategy is to snitch because it guarantees that you don\u2019t get the maximum jail term. However, the game gets more interesting when played in repeated rounds because players who have been betrayed in one round have the chance to get their own back in the next iteration. Until now, everyone thought the best strategy in iterative prisoner\u2019s dilemma was to copy your opponents behaviour in the previous round. This tit-for-tat approach guarantees that you both spend the same time in jail. That conclusion was based on decades of computer simulations and a certain blind faith in the symmetry of the solution. So the news that there are other strategies that allow one player to not only beat the other but to determine their time in jail is nothing short of revolutionary. The new approach is called the zero determinant strategy (because it involves the process of setting a mathematical object called a determinant to zero). It turns out that the tit-for-tat approach is a special case of the zero determinant strategy: the player using this strategy determines that the other player\u2019s time in jail is equal to theirs. But there are a whole set of other strategies that make the other player spend far more time in jail (or far less if you\u2019re feeling generous). The one caveat is that the other player must be unaware that they are being manipulated. If they discover the ruse, they can play a strategy that results in the maximum jail time for both players: ie both suffer. Game theorists call this the Ultimatum Game. It\u2019s equivalent to giving Alice \u00a3100 and asking her to divide it between her and Bob. Bob can accept the division or refuse it if he thinks the division is unfair, in which case both players get nothing. The refusal is Bob\u2019s way of punishing Alice for her greed. The interesting thing here is that when both players are aware of the zero determinant ruse, the prisoner\u2019s dilemma turns into a different game. Press and Dyson\u2019s discovery has sent game theorists scurrying to work out the implications. They\u2019ve been using prisoner\u2019s dilemma to gain insight into everything from Cold War politics and climate change negotiations to psychology and, of course, the evolutionary origin of co-operation itself. Today, we see one of the first paper\u2019s to study these implications in detail. Christoph Adami and Arend Hintze from Michigan State University in East Lansing investigate whether the zero determinant strategies are evolutionary stable. That\u2019s an interesting question. It asks the following: if an entire population of individuals all play zero determinant strategies, could another strategy spread through the population and take over? If not, zero determinant strategies are evolutionary stable. Adami and Hintze show that zero determinant strategies are not evolutionary stable. The reason is that they do not perform well against each other and that leaves the door open for other strategies to sneak in and take over. Zero determinant strategies are not stable in another way. Adami and Hintze show that if the player\u2019s strategies evolve, the changes that occur between one generation and the next ensure that the new strategy is generally not zero determinant. So the strategy cannot survive. However, there is one scenario in which Adami and Hintze say the new strategy should be stable. That\u2019s when the zero determinant players can work out whether other players are using the same strategy or not. In that case, they can avoid the loses that occur when playing against their own while exploiting ignorant players. So to be stable, zero determinant strategies require additional information about their opponents.This information gives them a clear advantage but probably only a temporary one. \u201cSuch an advantage is bound to be short-lived as opposing strategies evolve to counteract the recognition,\u201d they say. In other words, the other players ought to develop a kind of camouflage that prevents them being spotted and exploited. That may explain why nobody\u2019s found examples of zero determinant strategies in nature: in most cases they won\u2019t be stable and even if they are, the situation is likely to be short lived. As Adami and Hintze put it in the title of their paper: winning isn\u2019t everything. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t examples out there ready to be found. On the contrary. \u201cThis type of evolutionary arms race has been, and will be, observed throughout the biosphere,\u201d say Adami and Hintze. Of course, this is just the beginning of an entirely new approach to game theory that has profound implications. Tags Main Page Research Computer Science Integrative Biology Mathematics",

The initiative is intended to include more students in computer science, including underrepresented groups of students, especially since job opportunities in the CS field are growing, with 51 percent of all STEM jobs are projected to be in a CS-related field by 2018. Although all of this seems to be happening far away in Washington D.C., UTCS is doing its part to contribute to President Obama\u2019s #CSForAll campaign and bring computer science to more children and teens through a program called the Hour of Code. Image In 2014, President Obama learned how to write his first line of code from an 11-year-old. And in February, he announced a bold new initiative to ensure all of our students get the opportunity to learn the computer science skills they need to succeed in a 21st century economy. A program by Code.org , the Hour of Code is an event hosted at a school or organization in which students new to computer science learn the basics of coding within an hour through tutorials and activities that range in skill level from kindergarten to high school. This December during Computer Science Education Week, UTCS students, alumni, and faculty will again participate in the Hour of Code by volunteering for a total of 300 hours teaching approximately 3,500 students in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Austin. UT participated in an Hour of Code event for the first time last year during Computer Science Education Week, which was December 7-11. About 100 volunteers made up of UTCS faculty, staff, alumni, and undergraduate and graduate students helped run the Hour of Code for over 200 hours, reaching over 2,300 students at 10 different Austin schools ranging from pre-kindergarten up through high school. The one-hour tutorials that are taught at an Hour of Code event are not intended to make all participants expert coders, according to their website . Instead, the event is supposed to encourage participation among a diverse group of students and get them interested in computer science classes. \u201cIt\u2019s all about reaching out and having everyone participating in an hour of coding and showing them what computer science can do,\u201d UTCS lecturer Alison Norman said. \u201cThis is all about getting CS to schools and showing them what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Today at 1:00 pm, the White House Computer Science for All Summit will be livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live , and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will be tweeting about the event from @WhiteHouseOSTP with the hashtag #CSForAll.

    "text_content": "Capital Campaign Update: The Next Chapter | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Capital Campaign Update: The Next Chapter Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, December 19, 2012 In less than a month, the fences will come down, the construction crews will pack up their equipment, and UT Computer Science will be handed the keys to its bright, shiny new home\u2014The Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall. What a home it is! If you\u2019ve been keeping up with this project, you\u2019ve undoubtedly heard us brag about the state of the art research pods; the collaborative study spaces for our expanding student body; and the expanded opportunities for integrating our undergraduate with faculty research projects. It is a game-changer for UTCS. It\u2019s also important to point out that this project was only possible because of the private gifts from the two foundations that provided the majority of the funding (The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation). This reflects the extent to which this department and the larger university depend on philanthropic gifts. This is true not just for large capital projects like this one; philanthropy is increasingly central to everything we do, which is why the success of the current capital campaign is so critical. Image Despite UT\u2019s classification as a public institution, state tax revenues make up a dwindling share of the university\u2019s budget. In the 80\u2019s, the state was responsible for nearly half all university revenue. Today? Budget cut after budget cut has taken the state\u2019s share of university funding all the way down to 13%. The university and the Department of Computer Science have responded by tightening our belts, making some difficult decisions, but also by acknowledging that maintaining our status as a world-class university and a top-ten ranked computer science department will depend on our ability to find our resources and revenues in other places. That includes developing a strategy to make sure our alumni understand that working together to develop an expanded culture of giving lies at the heart of the future value of a UTCS degree. Earlier this month, UT passed the $2 billion mark in its $3 billion capital campaign. That\u2019s a tremendous milestone, and one that includes gifts from over 121,915 university alumni. In terms of how that impacts the department, the overwhelming majority of our philanthropic support has been focused on our new building. While that is a huge accomplishment, relative to other academic units this department has comparatively little support in place for things like student scholarships and the excellence funds. This is no small challenge. In the absence of state funding, it will be scholarships that keep tuition affordable; excellence funds that elevate strategic priorities and keep UTCS ranked among the top 10; and privately endowed professorships and chairs that allow the department to continue to recruit the faculty that are the cornerstone of our success. While the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex is unquestionably a big step in our efforts to move UTCS forward, we must keep in mind that it is a first step among many. As the year comes to a close, and you\u2019re thinking about your own charitable giving, take a moment to consider how you can play a role in that future. Your gift can be critical to this well-being of UT Computer Science, to the research that changes the way we use technology, and to the scholarships that make the education you received available to the next generation.

    "text_content": "Molecular Matchmaking for Drug Discovery | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Molecular Matchmaking for Drug Discovery Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, May 16, 2012 From image processing, to 3D modeling, to search algorithms, computer and computational science help improve the drug discovery pipeline Image For millennia, mankind has discovered new drugs either through educated guesswork or blind luck. But with the proliferation of advanced computing, a new paradigm has emerged whereby one can find drug targets through simulation and modeling. Chandrajit Bajaj , professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin has been integrally involved in these efforts for more than 20 years. Computational and Applied Mathematics chair in Visualization and director of the Computational Visualization Center at UT's Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) , over his career Bajaj has systematically attacked each step of the drug discovery process, improving the speed and accuracy of the algorithms involved in computational drug discovery. The research has been sponsored by the National Institute of Health , the National Science Foundation , and the Texas Institute of Drug and Diagnostic Development . Image A combination of modeling, simulation, analysis and visualization, the process is accomplished through the expert application of biophysical algorithms and the high-performance, parallel-processing supercomputers of the Texas Advanced Computing Center's (TACC). \"Computers are a good way to accelerate the process of drug design,\" said Bajaj. \"It takes 10 years to proof out a drug, and a billion dollars or more. Hence computational drug discovery is not only timesaving, but economics tells you this is the way we should be going.\" [Recent studies suggest the cost and time required to move from the discovery phase to delivery is growing, with fewer drugs approved by the FDA per billion dollars spent. These findings highlighting the need for faster, cheaper methods.] The work of discovering a breakthrough new drug begins with a careful analysis of the virus, bacteria or mutation that causes the illness. By shooting powerful x-rays through a sample, electron microscopes create nanoscale pictures of the relevant molecules in near-natural conditions. The images that emerge from these microscopes are a speckled mess, however, and must be cleaned up considerably to become useful. Combine 100,000 of these cleaned-up images and you have a three-dimensional model that can tell you about the structure of the molecule you are exploring. Structure is an important characteristic for drug discovery because it reflects the shape of the relevant molecules, and shape complementarity \u2014 the degree to which two molecules fit together \u2014 is a major factor in whether a drug will bond: the first step toward accomplishing its mission. When done correctly, the 3D model allows one to understand, identify and test potential binding sites on a virus. \"The nice thing about the electron projection is that you can build up volumetric models, so you can not only build a surface model from the outside, but also include information that is inside,\" Bajaj said. As a consequence of improvements to the image reconstruction and modeling algorithms, Bajaj and his collaborators can now identify secondary structures of molecules, like individual side-chains \u2014 floppy but crucial limbs that extend from the central spine of molecule. This level of detail is required to accurately predict binding. Image A recent paper by Bajaj, Samrat Goswami (Exa Corporation), and Qin Zhang (UT Austin) in the February 2012 edition of the Journal of Structural Biology showed that their algorithms were able to detect the secondary structures (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets) of proteins through intermediate (6\u201310 \u00c5) and coarse (10\u201315 \u00c5) resolution 3D maps reconstructed primarily from single particle cryo-electron microscopy. \"If you don't get all the factors into simulation, you get the wrong answer and your predictions suffer,\" said Bajaj. \"And if your predictions suffer, you haven't done anything to accelerate the solution. You're just loading yourself down.\" Once a target molecule's structure has been determined, it is then necessary to test potential drug compounds to see if any of them might fit a binding site. In the case of the HIV virus, as studied by Bajaj, the goal is find a molecule that can bind to a specific location on the virus' surface and signal to the virus that it has reached its destination. Rather than injecting its genetic material into a host cell, the potential drug would induce the virus to spill its contents in the extra-cellular medium where it would do no harm. But in a world of potential compounds, how does a scientist find the one drug molecule that might match and bind to the target region? Over the last decade, computer scientists have found faster ways to search for things using computers. Call it the \"Googlization\" of research. Bajaj has taken these insights and applied them to the problem of drug target screening. Instead of using search algorithms to find the closest coffee shop, Bajaj and his research team use them to create an ordered list of targets based on the binding energies and biochemical dynamics when two molecules come into contact, which indicates the most compatible compounds. The molecules with the highest ranking are then visualized by Bajaj and analyzed to reveal where the algorithms have worked and where they can be improved. \"We not only quantify the accuracy, but also the errors that we make,\" Bajaj explained. \"Without knowing the cause of error, how can you go back and improve your model?\" Image To make matters more difficult, researchers must ensure that the target compounds don't bind to other vital biological molecules, as these can lead to serious side effects. The sheer number of possible combinations and configurations boggles the mind. But as computer hardware and algorithms improve, such problems are becoming tractable. Bajaj uses practically every system in TACC's computational ecosystem to solve these problems, including Ranger and Lonestar (TACC's high performance computing systems), Longhorn (TACC's remote visualization system) and Stallion (the super high-resolution tiled display in the TACC/ACES Visualization Laboratory). \"We are blessed at UT Austin with having all of these high performance computers and the TACC organization, because without them we couldn't make progress,\" Bajaj said. Utilizing both CPU- and GPU-based methods, and mapping different processes to different architectures to accelerate the computation, Bajaj and his team improved the resolution and accuracy of the drug models tremendously. They have also sped up the docking search by an order of magnitude. \"What used to take months is now taking a few days,\" he said. According to J. Tinsley Oden, director of the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, Bajaj's research has the potential to transform the way the drug discovery process works. \"Dr. Bajaj's breakthrough work on computer modeling the incredibly complex mechanisms central to the design, behavior, and delivery of drugs for combating infectious diseases is a testament to the power of modern computer modeling and simulation, high performance computing, computer visualization, and to Bajaj's special abilities and deep insight into both computer modeling and the biological processes involved in drug delivery,\" he said. Computational drug discovery is a hot topic in academic research centers and industry alike. As chair of a study section of the National Institutes of Health, Bajaj often speaks with individuals from the pharmaceutical industry about changes in the field. \"More and more, they're moving into the computational drug screening arena, and more and more it's teams of people working together,\" Bajaj said. \"The biophysicist, the biochemist and the synthetic chemist are sitting together with the computational expert, and they say it's giving them clues as to what they should be doing next.\" Original article published on the Texas Advanced Computing Center's website.

In any given week, I am exposed to topics and research in network and computer security, robotics, and exascale computing, to name a few. As part of the Interactive Systems, Simulations, and Analysis group, the majority of my time is on developing interactive simulation frameworks and researching expressive path, motion, and general planning capabilities. In other words, I develop accurate 3D \u201cgames\u201d and research analytical \u201cgaming\u201d technology to aid in Sandia\u2019s national-security missions. I also spend time doing short-term \u201crapid prototyping\u201d projects for a variety of related concepts including computer vision, big data analysis, and mobile systems. This breadth is part of what makes Sandia unique. As a part of my day-to-day work, I interact with world-class researchers and scientists from across the sciences, and am encouraged to learn and explore new areas, concepts, and technologies while utilizing my research background. It\u2019s hard not to spot me around Sandia; I\u2019ve been a fan of the University of Texas since I was young and can often be found sporting UT paraphernalia.  My time at UT and particularly in the Department of Computer Science laid the applied and theoretical groundwork I needed to get where I am today.  I left UTCS well-equipped to solve challenging problems and gain substantial depth in concepts and topics.  The undergraduate research that I did with Dr. Bajaj in high-performance visualization sparked my curiosity in graphics and interactive systems and also in research in general. Additionally, my involvement as a mentor for the Texas Interdisciplinary Plan showed me how rewarding it can be to teach others and give back.

The annual tournament, founded in 1997 to foster innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics research, is often touted as the world\u2019s biggest robotics and artificial intelligence event. Image The UT Austin Villa RoboCup Team (pink) playing at the 2012 Robot Soccer World Cup in Mexico City. Though the competition is fun, the AI research that is required to compete could someday lead to enhanced bomb-searching robots; autonomous cars that increase traveling efficiency and reduce automobile accidents; self-healing, smart computers; and AI agents that manage business supply chains more effectively than humans. UT Austin Villa defended its 2011 3D Simulation League title, featuring artificially intelligent robots that compete in simulated soccer games. For the first time in university history, the Texas team also won the RoboCupSoccer Standard Platform League (SPL) competition \u2014 one of the highest profile leagues at RoboCup. RoboCupSoccer SPL consists of teams using state-of-the-art, fully autonomous, humanoid Nao robots. Because the robots are standardized, teams concentrate on software development and programming the robots to \u201cthink\u201d and play the game. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the students for the great work that they put in, and especially the great research behind the success that made it all possible,\u201d said Stone, a professor in the Department of Computer Science. The Texas SPL team blew through its first round robin games and quarterfinal, winning each by at least a 4-goal margin, and won a nail-biter in the semifinals to go on to compete against the University of Bremen in Germany, the undefeated champions three years in a row. In the championship game, the Texas team took on an early 2-0 lead in the first half, claiming victory by a final score of 4-2. UT Austin Villa\u2019s SPL team includes Stone, doctoral students Todd Hester, Sam Barrett, Katie Genter, Piyush Khandelwal and Jake Menashe, and master\u2019s student Yuchen He. The simulation team consisted of Stone, doctoral student Patrick MacAlpine and undergraduates Adrian Lopez-Mobilia and Nick Collins. \u201cIn some sense, my team has been working toward this since I founded UT Austin Villa back in 2003,\u201d said Stone. \u201cWe are savoring the success of this RoboCup competition!\u201d Watch a video of the games on the UT Austin Villa YouTube channel .

This is her second internship, her first one being at Facebook in Palo Alto, California. She is simultaneously doing research on a SRC-URO fellowship in Computational Epidemiology. Image How did you hear about the internship/research fellowship? I found my internship by attending the career expo and talking to recruiters, as well as going to on-campus events where I would network and meet recruiters and engineers. What are you looking forward to? I\u2019m looking forward to trying something different this year. I\u2019m excited to learn something new this year and to gain new experiences. Working on Kindle presents a slew of interesting problems; along with working on a product, we\u2019re also looking towards the future of e-readers and how that can change the industry and even just how people read in general. It\u2019s amazing to see how technology touches people! What has your experience like so far? It\u2019s been incredible. I absolutely love my mentor; he\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s always making sure that I have all of the information that I need to do my job. Additionally, my team is made up of a bunch of really funny individuals from different parts of the world. We\u2019ve set up \u201cTeam Lunch Fridays,\u201d and we go out to eat and just tell funny stories for an hour or so. Some other interns and I love exploring Seattle. I think that working is important in an internship, but going out and exploring the city that you\u2019re in for a summer is part of it too! Based on your experience(s), would you recommend this to other students? I would definitely recommend doing an internship (or multiple!) while you\u2019re still in college. It\u2019s a great way to figure out what you want to work on for the future as well as to work in different parts of the country. Whether it be doing research or working for a company in the industry, any experience you get will be valuable. I can tell you from doing industry and research, I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself and about the work that I could potentially be doing in the future. What kind of influence will this experience have on your future? I think this internship especially will help me get a different view of the industry. Instead of working for a purely web-based company, I deliberately chose to work on a product so that I could get a completely different experience. Resume building isn\u2019t one of the things I think about when I look for opportunites \u2014 I think more about what I want to learn and what seems interesting to me. If you had the opportunity to do this again, would you? Oh, most definitely. I think I learn so much during the summers that I work. Even in this short time, I\u2019ve seen how much I\u2019ve grown and how much I\u2019ve learned. I went from always pestering my mentor to being able to stand on my own and navigate through the codebase to figure out my problems. He\u2019s so proud of me!

I think that internships really help you get a different perspective on the stuff we learn in school, as well as a good look inside of real tech companies and how they operate. Working on code in the real world is so much different (and often more interesting) than the carefully concocted examples in school. They also help you better understand what your interests are and give you a chance to see one potential career path in computer science. And getting paid for a summer isn\u2019t so bad either. If you had the opportunity to do this again, would you? Why or why not? If I had the opportunity I would definitely do it again!

Hack U is two days of learning, hacking and fun. Yahoo! Hack U came to UTCS March 22 & 23rd. Attendees at this year's hack heard interesting tech talks, received hacking tips and lessons, and took part in hands-on coding workshops where they worked with cutting-edge technology. The two-day event culminated with Yahoo!'s University Hack Day competition\u2014a 24-hour long festival of coding, camaraderie, demos, awards, food, and music. Teams came up with cool ideas and working prototypes. Hackers hacked for your opportunity to win cool prizes, a spot in the gallery, street cred and the chance to represent their school at the Hack All-Stars Event in New York City. The winning Hackers, walking away with iPads, were Farhad Abasov, Hassaan Markhiani, Andy Luong, and Li Zhang representing Team HALF. Their Hack was called Worldle, a multi-user, real time word game similar to \u201cBoggle.\u201d Winner Li Zhang, a petroleum engineering major commented, \u201cThe 23 hours of coding really showed me how much progress we could make as a team in such a short amount of time. The competition illustrates our work flow after we graduate and start working: everyone is working on their own piece in parallel, so it's our job to make our code readable and able to be easily implemented.\u201d The second place hack, a videogame called Tramp Runner, demonstrated a good use of integration with physics principles. Team Tramp Runner, represented by Julian Michael and Evan Ott, developed the video game. Tramp Runner is a game in which the player\u2019s avatar is a human being with separately controlled movements of head and feet jumping on a fixed trampoline track shown as a series of masses connected by springs in the middle that actually follows the laws of physics. Two teams tied for third place. Teeter Party, by Craig Yeh was an impressive development of a multi-user simulation leveraging physics principles to achieve optimum balance on a virtual TeeterTotter. Also tied for third place was TwitterStorm, a hack developed by Prad Nelluru offering a real-time 3D Twitter data stream visualization as a storm of Tweets. Additional hackers representing the iSchool included the team of Sophia Kang and Daniela He, the only female hackers, who developed an image comparison game.

    "text_content": "Toward Lowering the Power Consumption of Microprocessors | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Toward Lowering the Power Consumption of Microprocessors Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, January 20, 2012 Image AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 The first systematic power profiles of microprocessors could help lower the energy consumption of both small cell phones and giant data centers, report computer science professors from The University of Texas at Austin and the Australian National University. Their results may point the way to how companies like Google, Apple, Intel and Microsoft can make software and hardware that will lower the energy costs of very small and very large devices. \u201cThe less power cell phones draw, the longer the battery will last,\u201d says Kathryn McKinley , professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cFor companies like Google and Microsoft, which run these enormous data centers, there is a big incentive to find ways to be more power efficient. More and more of the money they\u2019re spending isn\u2019t going toward buying the hardware, but toward the power the datacenters draw.\u201d McKinley says that without detailed power profiles of how microprocessors function with different software and different chip architectures, companies are limited in terms of how well they can optimize for energy usage. The study she conducted with Stephen M. Blackburn of The Australian National University and their graduate students is the first to systematically measure and analyze application power, performance, and energy on a wide variety of hardware. This work was recently invited to appear as a Research Highlight in the Communications of the Association for Computer Machinery (CACM). It\u2019s also been selected as one of this year\u2019s \u201cmost significant research papers in computer architecture based on novelty and long-term impact\u201d by the journal IEEE Micro . \u201cWe did some measurements that no one else had done before,\u201d says McKinley. \u201cWe showed that different software, and different classes of software, have really different power usage.\u201d McKinley says that such an analysis has become necessary as both the culture and the technologies of computing have shifted over the past decade. Energy efficiency has become a greater priority for consumers, manufacturers and governments because the shrinking of processor technology has stopped yielding exponential gains in power and performance. The result of these shifts is that hardware and software designers have to take into account tradeoffs between performance and power in a way they did not ten years ago. \u201cSay you want to get an application on your phone that\u2019s GPS-based,\u201d says McKinley, \u201cIn terms of energy, the GPS is one of the most expensive functions on your phone. A bad algorithm might ping your GPS far more than is necessary for the application to function well. If the application writer could analyze the power profile, they would be motivated to write an algorithm that pings it half as often to save energy without compromising functionality.\u201d McKinley believes that the future of software and hardware design is one in which power profiles become a consideration at every stage of the process. Intel, for instance, has just released a chip with an exposed power meter, so that software developers can access some information about the power profiles of their products when run on that chip. McKinley expects that future generations of chips will expose even more fine-grained information about power usage. Software developers like Microsoft (where McKinley is spending the next year, while taking a leave from the university) are already using what information they have to inform their designs. And device manufacturers are testing out different architectures for their phones or tablets that optimize for power usage. McKinley says that even consumers may get information about how much power a given app on their smart phone is going to draw before deciding whether to install it or not. \u201cIn the past, we optimized only for performance,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you were picking between two software algorithms, or chips, or devices, you picked the faster one. You didn\u2019t worry about how much power it was drawing from the wall socket. There are still many situations today\u2014for example, if you are making software for stock market traders\u2014where speed is going to be the only consideration. But there are a lot of other areas where you really want to consider the power usage.\u201d News Categories Faculty Research Tags Research Main Page Kathryn McKinley Featured Energy Computer Science",

The Gates Complex will be the first step in the department's plan to transform computing education and research in Texas. To facilitate advancement in computer science and its emerging interdisciplinary areas, the complex, consisting of two LEED certified buildings connected by an atrium, will include 17,500 assignable square feet of flexible and highly programmable research laboratory space, including labs in ten faculty research pods. All of this square footage is focused on encouraging research interaction and collaboration. Faculty and their grad students and research groups who share similar research interests inhabit each pod. In the center of each pod will be a 1,000 square foot lab; the pod will determine how that lab space is best used. In addition, the building will house Professor Peter Stone 's Robotics Lab, Professor Dana Ballard 's Virtual Reality Lab, and several uncommitted labs for incoming faculty. One of the key advantages of the research lab space reflects that of the whole building\u2014the department will no longer have to think small and worry about how to make cramped corners work and how to retrofit outdated space to meet current needs. The new building was designed to be flexible\u2014to have enough infrastructure to allow researchers to think about the research that they want to do in the building rather than how to make the building support their research. Having the entire department under one roof in a space that is conducive to interaction and collaboration will have a huge impact on the department\u2019s research. Professor Lorenzo Alvisi , whose research focuses on distributed systems, says, regarding how the building will impact research in the department, \u201cLet me count the ways! First, physical proximity with close colleagues and students. My work thrives through close and intense collaborations between faculty and students, and the new building is designed\u2014from the layout of where student and faculty sit to the numerous and attractive meeting spaces\u2014to facilitate such collaborations.\u201d Lorenzo goes on to explain his vision on the new building as a conduit for collaboration. \u201cSecond, the new building gives serendipity a chance: some of my best ideas have begun from casual conversations with a colleague or a student met in a corridor or in the lounge: the architects of the new building have thought hard on how the building layout can enhance the chances for such fortuitous encounters: surrounded as we will be with whiteboards, casual conversations can seamlessly transition into exciting technical discussions.\u201d Image Faculty, staff, and students alike are looking forward to moving into the new building and being under one roof. \"In the new building, I'm looking forward to seeing more colleagues more often, and of course, to the possibility of fruitful collaborations, as a result,\" said Assistant Professor Michael Walfish . Image Students are, of course, the central focus of UTCS. Introducing our undergraduate students to and involving them in research is a part of the department\u2019s innovative curriculum. \"I believe the building will allow us to harness one of the resources of our department that space limitations made difficult to tap in to the past: the research creativity and enthusiasm of our undergraduate students . In the world of ideas, the classroom and the lab should never be far away in a research university like ours,\u201d says Lorenzo. \u201cIn the new building, they will literally be just a few steps away: virtually every floor includes both classroom and research space.\u201d The new Gates Complex will not only impact undergraduate research, but their entire academic experience here at UTCS. \u201cCrucially, the building will also house lounges and studying spaces for undergraduates. While in the past many undergraduates have largely perceived the department as an administrative 'container' for their teachers, for the first time they will find themselves embedded in the exciting intellectual life that I am fortunate to be part of every day. I expect that the invisible wall that many undergraduate students still perceive between them and Research (with the scary capital R) will thankfully begin to crumble.\u201d Partnership is the lifeblood of the department and is anticipated to grow and thrive in the new building. \u201cThe new building will for the first time give us a chance to invite colleagues and collaborators from outside UT to visit us for extended periods of time. In a job that is about ideas and innovations, the periodic injection of fresh perspectives and new talent is critical,\u201d explains Lorenzo. \"I am especially looking forward to the opportunity to create close collaborations with industrial partners: a tremendously exciting development in this respect is the recent partnership between our lab and SunGard, one of the world\u2019s leading software and technology services companies, to create a Cloud Computing Research Center. The new building will enable us to work side by side with SunGard engineers in developing the next generation of dependable and scalable storage services. I see this partnership as the first of many to come.\u201c The Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall is the vehicle for change for UTCS\u2014from new collaborations and partnerships in research to creating an entirely new and enriched educational experience for our students. For more information, please contact us about the many opportunities available, including namings for major academic facilities, administrative facilities, student facilities, laboratories, and community and visitor spaces.",

Both were recently awarded Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellows. They will receive $50,000 over two years for the research of their choice. They are among 118 researchers to receive fellowships this year. Grauman\u2019s research is in computer vision, with particular focus on image classification, search and retrieval.  Her goal is to develop methods for content-based search of massive collections of images (including video) that are as effective and efficient as the ones we use today for text. This is important and challenging because the pace that the world produces images (e.g. for entertainment, medicine, surveillance, and personal use) far exceeds the current capabilities for search and retrieval. Walfish's long-term goal is to let people use computer resources without having to trust (that is, assume) that those resources operate correctly. For example, can we build a distributed storage system that works even if all of the machines misbehave? Can we outsource computation to servers if the servers are not guaranteed to return the right answer? Can we build a network if we cannot trust that the routers will forward properly? It is challenging to build systems to a level of robustness where clients get useful work out of services even if the services malfunction in arbitrary ways. Yet, it is practically important to do so, as computing services are increasingly provided by third parties. \"Sloan Research Fellowships are, by far, the oldest program of the Sloan Foundation, although those who receive the grants are among the youngest scholars the Foundation assists. The Fellowship program has grown in size and cost over the years and now includes several disciplines not covered in the beginning; but its purpose - to stimulate fundamental research by young scholars of outstanding promise - remains the same.\" (from www.sloan.org/program ).

Dijkstra Memorial Lecture Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, September 8, 2011 The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on November 7, 2011. UTCS welcomed Richard Karp, Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, as the speaker for this event. This lecture series is made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Edsger W. Dijkstra . Watch the 2011 Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture! The 2011 Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture: Richard Karp: \u201cEffective Heuristics for NP-Hard Problems\u201d Talk Abstract: In many practical situations heuristic algorithms reliably give satisfactory solutions to real-life instances of optimization problems, despite evidence from computational complexity theory that the problems are intractable in general. Our long-term goal is to contribute to an understanding of this seeming contradiction, and to put the construction of heuristic algorithms on a firmer footing. In particular, we are interested in methods for tuning and validating heuristic algorithms by testing them on a training set of \"typical\" instances. About Richard Karp: Image Richard M. Karp was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 3, 1935. He attended Boston Latin School and Harvard University, receiving the Ph.D. in 1959. From 1959 to 1968 he was a member of the Mathematical Sciences Department at IBM Research. From 1968 to 1994 and from 1999 to the present he has been a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the Class of 1939 Chair and is currently a University Professor. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to the present he has been a Research Scientist at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. From 1995 to 1999 he was a Professor at the University of Washington. During the 1985-86 academic year he was the co-organizer of a Computational Complexity Year at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley. During the 1999-2000 academic year he was the Hewlett-Packard Visiting Professor at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. The unifying theme in Karp\u2019s work has been the study of combinatorial algorithms. His 1972 paper \u201cReducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\u2019\u2019 showed that many of the most commonly studied combinatorial problems are NP-complete, and hence likely to be intractable. Much of his work has concerned parallel algorithms, the probabilistic analysis of combinatorial optimization algorithms and the construction of randomized algorithms for combinatorial problems. His current activities center around algorithmic methods in genomics and computer networking. He has supervised thirty-nine Ph.D. dissertations. His honors and awards include: U.S. National Medal of Science, Turing Award, Kyoto Prize, Fulkerson Prize, Harvey Prize (Technion), Centennial Medal (Harvard), Dickson Prize (Carnegie Mellon), Lanchester Prize, Von Neumann Theory Prize, Von Neumann Lectureship, Distinguished Teaching Award (Berkeley), Faculty Research Lecturer (Berkeley), Miller Research Professor (Berkeley), Babbage Prize and ten honorary degrees. He is a member of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, the American Philosophical Society and the French Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science. About Edsger W. Dijkstra: Professor Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was a noted pioneer of the science and industry of computing. Born in 1930 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, he graduated from the Gymnasium Erasmianum in Rotterdam and obtained degrees in mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Leyden and a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Amsterdam. He was a professor of mathematics, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1962-1984 and was a Burroughs Corporation research fellow, 1973-1984. He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computing Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, 1984-1999, and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1999. Image Dijkstra was the 1972 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, often viewed as the Nobel Prize for computing. He was a member of the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. He received the 1974 AFIPS Harry Goode Award, the 1982 IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, and the 1989 ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. In 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra \"for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.\" Dijkstra is renowned for the insight that mathematical logic is and must be the basis for sensible computer program construction and for his contributions to mathematical methodology. He is responsible for the idea of building operating systems as explicitly synchronized sequential processes, for the formal development of computer programs, and for the intellectual foundations for the disciplined control of nondeterminacy. He is well known for his amazingly efficient shortest path algorithm and for having designed and coded the first ALGOL 60 compiler. He was famously the leader in the abolition of the GOTO statement from programming. Dijkstra was a prodigious writer. His entire collection of over thirteen hundred written works was digitally scanned and is accessible at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD . He also corresponded regularly with hundreds of friends and colleagues over the years --not by email but by conventional post. He strenuously preferred the fountain pen to the computer in producing his scholarly output and letters. Dijkstra enriched the language of computing with many concepts and phrases, such as structured programming, separation of concerns, synchronization, deadly embrace, dining philosophers, weakest precondition, guarded command, the excluded miracle, and the famous \"semaphores\" for controlling computer processes. The Oxford English Dictionary cites his use of the words \"vector\" and \"stack\" in a computing context. Dijkstra died after a long struggle with cancer on August 6, 2002 at his home in Nuenen, the Netherlands. News Categories Events Industry Relations Tags Edsger W. Dijkstra Richard Karp Schlumberger",

During their sophomore and junior years, students will take game-design oriented classes within their individual disciplines. Then in the students\u2019 senior year the three streams will come together into a capstone project class taught by industry leaders. The program began this past fall, with the first capstone project class being planned for spring 2013. The program leaders plan to offer the capstone class every semester after it starts. Students with valuable skills from any discipline are encouraged to participate. \u201cThe students will build actual computer games in the class, which will be designed and most likely taught by leading experts in the industry,\u201d Porter added. \u201cThis experience should mimic the way games are designed and developed in industry, and the students should graduate with a portfolio of tangible games they have contributed to.\u201d With only 30 seats in each capstone project class, admission will be on a competitive application basis. Students interested in applying for the class can be registered in any department or program of study at the university. \u201cBecause game design and development is such an interdisciplinary process, the program encompasses several colleges instead of being made into a specific major,\u201d Porter said. \u201cGames are developed by teams, each with specialties but each also versed in what other team members are doing. Our curriculum is intended to give students that background and experience.\u201d The program\u2019s industrial advisers include leaders at Ricochet Labs , Zynga Games , and Bioware Austin . \u201cAustin has a vibrant and growing computer game industry,\u201d said Porter, who also helped design and start the program. \u201cFor about ten years, representatives of the industry have been eager for the university to offer the program. We hope to significantly increase game development offerings across the colleges.\u201d Suggested classes for computer science students include: software engineering with C++, graphics, game technologies, artificial intelligence for games, and (multi-core) programming for performance.

Computer science professor Peter Stone has been working on what he calls \u201cintersections of the future\u201d for about a decade. \u201cA Ph.D. student of mine, Kurt Dresner , had the idea,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe was late for a meeting with me because he was stuck at a red light that he thought was far too long. And he thought, \u2018You know, once cars are autonomous we can do a lot better than that.\u2019\u201d In 2007, Stone and a group of undergraduate students worked on UT\u2019s submission to the Defense Department\u2019s Urban Challenge competition. They created an autonomous car, called Marvin, with the help of local electronics company Austin Robot Technology. Marvin can drive without human operation. He lives at UT\u2019s Pickle Research Campus. Stone says if Marvin and autonomous cars like him were to navigate U.S. roadways successfully, they\u2019d need an intersection management system . \u201cTaking traffic data and turning that into knowledge about where the cars are, what routes are free, and then taking actions such as changing, in real time, the directionality of roads or lanes \u2013 it\u2019s something that would be much more feasible with autonomous cars than with people,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIt would be very confusing for a person if, all of a sudden, in the middle of the day, you said, \u2018OK, this lane is going north-south instead of south-north.\u2019\u201d Stone delivered his findings in Vancouver, British Columbia, over the weekend at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. On his laptop, Stone shows a video showing how this traffic system works. \u201cWhat you see is a lot of cars, simulated cars, coming towards an intersection, and instead of having traffic signals that say go when it\u2019s green and stop when it\u2019s red, or stop signs that require them all to stop, instead the coordination is at a much finer granularity, so each car is calling ahead saying, \u2018I would like to arrive at a particular time, and here\u2019s the path I\u2019d like to take: I\u2019d like to go straight or I\u2019d like to go left,\u2019\u201d he said. The simulation is a sort of extremely organized chaos. The little cars resemble ants in a hive, speeding up and slowing down so gradually that you barely notice it. At every instance, the cars narrowly miss crashing into one another. Stone says by taking the human element out of driving, traffic flows more efficiently. And with the drastic reduction in the amount of acceleration and deceleration, harmful emissions could be reduced. \u201cIt\u2019s actually going to be better environmentally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be better from a safety perspective, and the statistics are that people spend, on average, 48 hours of their year stuck in traffic, and that costs billions of dollars in lost productivity and fuel. This is going to play a big role in reducing that.\u201d Stone says he and his colleagues will continue to refine the \u201cintersection of the future\u201d concept \u2014 expanding from single intersections to networks of them all operating together. He can\u2019t predict when Texans will be passengers in our own cars. Some things are out of his control, including laws and regulations. But starting March 1, he said, robot cars can be tested on Nevada\u2019s roads. Hawaii, Florida and Oklahoma are reportedly ready to follow suit. Stone says since the technology has already been established, it\u2019s only a matter a time.

The result was a computer brain that can't tell the difference between stories about itself and fanciful stories about gangsters, and claims responsibility for terrorist acts. What can we learn from a \"schizophrenic\" computer brain? In a paper published today in the journal Biological Psychiatry , researchers started with a neural network: a computer program that replicates, as best we know how, an actual human brain. It can take in information, learn from it, combine it, talk back to you. Then they applied to their computer brain a medical hypothesis about schizophrenia: that memories are encoded too quickly on the brain, something the researchers call \"hyper-learning.\" \"What the model suggests is if this process is accelerated unduly, that bad things happen and that stuff going into memory gets intermingled, corrupted, kind of like a bad sector in a hard drive,\" says Dr. Ralph Hoffman, a psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine. The brain takes in too much information, too quickly, \"can't organize it and sift it. And somehow something to do with that process may be running amok.\" Then Hoffman and his colleagues began telling their computer brain \"stories.\" Some were meant to be autobiographical, about a young doctor working in a New York City hospital. Then there was a second set of stories, some of which had parallel narrative structures to the autobiographical ones, involving \"crime and crime-fighting, mafia activities and assassination and things of that sort,\" Hoffman says. Next step: Have the neural network -- the computer brain -- try to retell the stories. Uli Grasemann, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, says the stories came out much differently than they went in. \"We get stories where the content is changed, but the local structure and the grammar remain intact,\" says Grasemann. \"So for example there might be a story about one gangster killing another gangster, and the network will basically leave the story intact and replace one of the gangsters with itself. \"There was a story about a terrorist bombing, and the network consistently replaced the terrorist with 'I'. Which is an interesting result because these confusions among actors, and inserting oneself into shared cultural stories like movies or legends, that's something that happens a lot with delusions or schizophrenia.\" The researchers tweaked the neural network in a number of ways they though might mimic schizophrenia. But this hyperlearning -- taking in too much information too fast -- emerged as the most promising. Hoffman says the next step is to keep comparing the results with actual schizophrenic people. \"If there is validation there, then a real exciting possibility is we might be able to use these artificial brains or networks to test out novel treatments that we haven't really thought of yet.\" News Categories Faculty Research Tags Artificial Intelligence DISCERN Risto Miikkulainen",

    "text_content": "Researchers Can Build on Public Support for Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Researchers Can Build on Public Support for Science Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, March 1, 2012 AAAS | Becky Ham Image As the United States prepares for a year of election-driven partisanship, William Press points to something that many Americans share: a commitment to science. He cites polls showing that the public believes science is vital to a strong economy and international presence, and that scientists are trustworthy and prestigious citizens. The public also delights in the discoveries that come from all corners, from medical breakthroughs to breathtaking space missions. With this in mind, the new AAAS president thinks voters will be very interested to hear what the 2012 presidential candidates have to say about their own plans for science. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad segment of the American public that\u2019s interested in science and innovation, both the beauty and benefits of it, \u201d Press said in a recent interview. \u201cOne of our goals should be to find ways to allow those things to move forward, and not have them brought down by things we can\u2019t agree on.\u201d Press, a professor of computer science and integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin, said members of both political parties recognize that investments in innovation and education are vital to American success, and generally agree on the need to support basic research. When partisan arguments arise, he said, they reflect political and philosophical differences about government\u2019s role in transforming basic research into applications. However, he added, scientists must continue to \u201cjustify science as an essential investment in the future, not a frill to be postponed in each and every budget cycle.\u201d He suggested that the scientific community \u201chas been too passive in allowing the case for fundamental research to be framed in purely economic terms, often exemplified in narrow discussions of return-on-investment.\u201d He proposed that scientists should not shy away from speaking in visionary terms, making the case that basic and applied research can contribute to a future world marked by gains in education, an appreciation for the environment, rising incomes, and resiliency to global events like climate change and disease epidemics. \u201cAsserting this is not the same as proving it,\u201d Press acknowledged, but he thinks AAAS is the \u201cright organization to develop the broader and more rigorous justification for federal funding of basic and applied research that current times require.\u201d Scientists and policymakers still cite presidential science advisor Vannevar Bush\u2019s influential 1945 report, Science, the Endless Frontier to support federal science spending, he noted, \u201cbut the \u2018use by\u2019 date of that report and its many derivative reports may have expired with the end of the Cold War.\u201d While the organization as a whole can help to develop a 21st century blueprint for science policy, Press suggested that AAAS members can promote a stronger role for science in the public sphere by visiting congressional offices in their home districts. Although individual scientists may have partisan leanings, \u201cscience is intrinsically nonpartisan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can educate our members of Congress and their staffs on what we believe are the facts, and how certain we are about them.\u201d As a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ) for the past two years, Press has played an active role in bringing science to bear on national policies. A noted researcher whose work has spanned a remarkable range of disciplines\u2014from computer science to genomics, statistical methods, astrophysics, and international security\u2014he also served as deputy laboratory director for science and technology at the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1998 to 2004. Press succeeded plant biologist Nina V. Fedoroff as president when the AAAS Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, closed on 20 February. Fedoroff is now serving a one-year term as chairperson of the AAAS Board of Directors. Fedoroff stressed the importance of international science collaboration during her presidency, and Press believes that AAAS should expand its strong programs in this area. He said the organization\u2019s support for international science is a critical counterbalance against the notion that global collaborations are a \u201cluxury rather than an economic necessity.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little worried that the message that international science is mutually beneficial could get lost, \u201d Press said, \u201cin a time when the United States and other nations are in tough times and looking inward.\u201d Press noted that developing nations in particular have seized upon science as a way to transform their economies and increase their participation in world affairs. \u201cWe may be entering a period of decades when developing nations are on an upward trajectory, and we think science and technology can play an enormously positive role in supporting that trajectory.\u201d U.S. graduate school programs still attract researchers from around the world, he noted, but many organizations\u2014including PCAST and AAAS \u2014are offering ideas about improving undergraduate science education. \u201cWe need to admit that we\u2019re not doing a good job in those first two years\u201d of undergraduate study, Press said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to be attracted to science by a freshman course in which they\u2019re just going to be sitting in a large lecture hall. But they are attracted when we can get them out into research laboratories and they see what research really is.\u201d He\u2019s optimistic that the nation is poised to improve K-12 science education, citing bipartisan support for the National Academies\u2019 2007 report , Rising Above the Gathering Storm , which advocated strong investment in science and engineering education. Press also noted that many states now belong to organizations such as the nonprofit Achieve that support standards-based science education reforms like those promoted by AAAS\u2019s Project 2061 . Press\u2019s mother, Billie Kallick Press, was an educator who advocated for some of the earliest gifted programs in California schools, as the United States became more committed to science education in the years following the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957. His father, Frank Press, was a noted geophysicist and science advisor to U.S. President Jimmy Carter from 1976 to 1980. \u201cI\u2019ve always done science because it\u2019s what I wanted to do,\u201d Press said. \u201cI\u2019ve always seen it as this wonderful combination of having fun and benefiting the world.\u201d As an astrophysicist at Harvard University from 1976 to 1998, Press was best known for his collaboration on the Press-Schechter formalism, which predicts the masses of galaxies within the universe, as well as his work on supernovae to estimate cosmic distances, which helped clear a path to the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The power of computational science is the constant in his career, from his Numerical Recipes books on scientific computing and more recent projects in molecular biology and clinical trials. \u201cI had such fun, and was productive riding this wave in the physical sciences,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I just could never forgive myself if I didn\u2019t take the opportunity to stay on this same wave and do computational biology.\u201d Press\u2019s eclectic interests make him an excellent ambassador for a message that he wants the public to understand: Science doesn\u2019t proceed in a neat or linear fashion. Who could have predicted, he asked, that a probability distribution algorithm worked out by Google\u2019s founders would become the backbone of a cultural and economic giant? \u201cWhen we have a national and global scientific enterprise that is out there building terrain,\u201d Press said, \u201cthat can become fertile ground on which all kinds of applications can grow. \u201d For Press, the beauty and the benefits of science are inseparable. \u201cI think the more we can juxtapose those two ideas and show that they\u2019re related,\u201d he said, \u201cthe better we\u2019ll do at making the case that we support it because it\u2019s useful, and because it\u2019s a part of who we want to be.\u201d News Categories Faculty Research Tags William Press",

Maybe there wasn\u2019t enough money, any access to people with complementary skills, or not enough confidence to get it off the ground. 3-Day Startup (3DS) provides the opportunity to pitch that idea to a panel of potential investors, release a prototypeand build enough momentum to sustain a startup company outside the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a great chance to get experience, in a condensed period of time, and learn what it\u2019s like to work at a startup,\u201d says Joel Hestness, a 3DS organizer and CS graduate student. On the first weekend of April, 40 UT business and engineering students and recent graduates gathered at the Austin Technology Incubator with one common goal: start a technology company over the course of three days. 3DS provides all the resources for budding entrepreneurs to offer their idea and bring it to life. This year four viable technology startup prototypes came out of the high intensity 3-Day Startup event. Keep an eye out for news and updates on these startups in future newsletters. Last year, Turn2live.com was born out of the 3DS event and is still alive and kicking. Turn2live.com, a website that allows users to search for live music in Austin based on their moods, officially launched at SXSW 2009 at the Austin Interactive Showcase . 3DS organizers are focusing on fostering connections between campus and local entrepreneurs. Joel says the vision is to make 3DS a reoccurring event. The event has two successful efforts under its belt and is looking to expand. \"This is a fantastic example of the rapid growth of entrepreneurship among students on campus,\u201d says Isaac Barchas of The Austin Technology Incubator (ATI) . ATI is a nonprofit organization that harnesses local business, government and academic resources to provide strategic counsel, operational guidance and infrastructure support to its member companies to help them transition from early stage ventures to successful technology businesses. Isaac explains, \u201cATI's involvement means that 3DS has institutional support from the University and the entrepreneurial community that ATI serves.\" Joel expresses his gratitude for the support 3DS has received, saying, \u201cWe really appreciate the support of our sponsors, UTCS faculty and staffand alumni.\u201d Future involvement from CS students, faculty and collaboration with local alumni with startup experience are essential to the success of 3DS. Also, essential to the success of the 3-Day Startup events are the sponsors. This year two Friends of Computer Sciences (FoCS) members were among the 3DS sponsors, Amazon and NetQoS .

Dijkstra Memorial Lecture Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, October 12, 2010 The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the inaugural Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on October 12, 2010. UTCS was excited to welcome Sir Tony Hoare, Emeritus Professor at Oxford and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, as the speaker for this event. This lecture series was made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Edsger W. Dijkstra . The lecture was a success, with over 200 guests in attendance. Following the lecture, Sir Tony was joined by grad students, faculty, staff and other invited guests at an intimate reception in celebration of his visit to campus. Watch the 2010 Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture! The 2010 Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture: Sir Tony Hoare: \u201cWhat Can We Learn From Edsger W. Dijkstra?\u201d Talk Abstract: This is what I have learnt from Edsger: 1. Computing Science is a branch of pure science. Computer Programs are its subject of study. Researchers seek understanding of the relationship between the interior structure and content of the program and its externally observed properties and behaviour. Like other branches of science, such basic research is best pursued independent of possible application, for the satisfaction of scientific curiosity. 2. Software Engineering is the large-scale application of logic. Logical reasoning provides the means for a rational process of design and development of programs, together with their proof of correctness. Like other branches of engineering, it seeks economy, efficiency and reliability in meeting the wishes of its customers. By exploiting the underlying science, there is no longer need to rely solely on trial and error. 3. Computing Science has learnt much from mathematics and from philosophy: one day this debt will be repaid. Then it will be clear that \u201cIn their capacity as a tool, computers will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture. In their capacity as intellectual challenge, they are without precedent in the cultural history of mankind.\u201d I will comment on these lessons from my own experience and in my own words. About Sir Tony Hoare: Image Tony Hoare was a student of Latin and Greek Language and Literature. He graduated from Oxford University in 1956 with a Master's degree; his studies also included Ancient History and Philosophy, which was his favorite subject. His first employment was with a computer manufacturer, for whom he led the implementation of the second commercial implementation of ALGOL 60 (delivered after Dijkstra's first implementation). In April 1961 he attended a week's school on ALGOL 60 at which Dijkstra was an instructor; and later they served together as members of IFIP WG2.3, a Working Group charged with the further development of ALGOL. In 1968, he was appointed a Professor of Computing Science at the Queen's University Belfast, where he chose as his lifelong research goal Dijkstra's ideal of programs that are correct by construction. In pursuit of this goal, Dijkstra has been a constant collaborator and a personal friend. About Edsger W. Dijkstra: Professor Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was a noted pioneer of the science and industry of computing. Born in 1930 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, he graduated from the Gymnasium Erasmianum in Rotterdam and obtained degrees in mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Leyden and a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Amsterdam. He was a professor of mathematics, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1962-1984 and was a Burroughs Corporation research fellow, 1973-1984. He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computing Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, 1984-1999, and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1999. Image Dijkstra was the 1972 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, often viewed as the Nobel Prize for computing. He was a member of the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. He received the 1974 AFIPS Harry Goode Award, the 1982 IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, and the 1989 ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. In 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra \"for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.\" Dijkstra is renowned for the insight that mathematical logic is and must be the basis for sensible computer program construction and for his contributions to mathematical methodology. He is responsible for the idea of building operating systems as explicitly synchronized sequential processes, for the formal development of computer programs, and for the intellectual foundations for the disciplined control of nondeterminacy. He is well known for his amazingly efficient shortest path algorithm and for having designed and coded the first Algol 60 compiler. He was famously the leader in the abolition of the GOTO statement from programming. Dijkstra was a prodigious writer. His entire collection of over thirteen hundred written works was digitally scanned and is accessible at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD . He also corresponded regularly with hundreds of friends and colleagues over the years --not by email but by conventional post. He strenuously preferred the fountain pen to the computer in producing his scholarly output and letters. Dijkstra enriched the language of computing with many concepts and phrases, such as structured programming, separation of concerns, synchronization, deadly embrace, dining philosophers, weakest precondition, guarded command, the excluded miracle, and the famous \"semaphores\" for controlling computer processes. The Oxford English Dictionary cites his use of the words \"vector\" and \"stack\" in a computing context. Dijkstra died after a long struggle with cancer on August 6, 2002 at his home in Nuenen, the Netherlands. News Categories Events Tags Edsger W. Dijkstra Sir Tony Hoare",

Ben and Victor were among a very impressive group. A number of nominees were commended for making significant contributions to more than one research project, several were authors or coauthors on multiple papers, others had made presentations at major conferences, and some had produced software artifacts that were in widespread use. Many of the nominees had been involved in successful summer research or internship programs, many had been teaching assistants, tutors, or mentors, and a number had significant involvement in community volunteer efforts. It is quite an honor to be selected for Honorable Mention from this group. Ben Braun Image Ben Braun is a junior majoring in Computer Science (CS) and Mathematics.  He is a member of the Computer Science Department's Turing Scholars Honors Program, as well as the College of Natural Sciences' Dean's Scholars Honors Program, and he has combined his interests in CS and Chemistry by applying non-linear mathematical optimization techniques to the area of nanotechnology. Working with Prof. Andy Ellington from the Department of Biochemistry, Ben's main research contribution is in the construction of nanoscale devices.  Ben has created a unique software tool that automates a process that previously relied on input from human experts.  Not only does this tool promise to improve the quality of nanoscale devices, but it has the potential to create much larger nanoscale devices than are possible with previous techniques.  Ben is currently developing a new simulator that will further improve the design process by allowing him to evaluate the nanoscale devices created by his software tool. In addition to this work, Ben also led a team of UT undergraduates to a Gold Award in BIOMD , an international biomolecular design competition. Victor Vu Image Victor Vu is a senior and part of a select group of students in UTCS\u2019s Integrated 5-Year Bachelor/Masters program. He has been a strong contributor to two research projects during his time at the University of Texas at Austin. First, he was a key participant on the UT Austin Villa robot soccer team that finished in first place in the 2011 International RoboCup 3D simulation league competition. Also, he has made significant contributions to Assistant Professor Mike Walfish\u2019s Pepper project. Victor has spent two summers interning at Amazon.com doing a myriad of work, which included developing a new prototype recommendation system. Further, Victor has maintained a 4.0 GPA while serving as a teaching assistant and working heavily on research. Professor and Chair Bruce Porter says, \u201cHe is an exceptional student, even among those in our Turing Scholars Honors Program.\u201d The department is extremely proud of Ben and Victor for their hard work and accomplishments.

Writing at the blog of the programming firm Fog Creek Software , Anna Lewis, the firm's recruiting director, says it isn't so. In fact, in 1987, 42% of American programmers were women -- and, for a period, programming was even considered \"women's work.\" Image Lewis highlights an article from the April, 1967 issue of Cosmopolitan , \"The Computer Girls\": [I]f it doesn't sound like woman's work -- well, it just is.... \"I had this idea I'd be standing at a big machine and pressing buttons all day long,\" says a girl who programs for a Los Angeles bank. \"I couldn't have been further off the track. I figure out how the computer can solve a problem, and then instruct the machine to do it.\" \"It's just like planning a dinner,\" explains Dr. Grace Hopper, now a staff scientist in system programming for Univac. (She helped develop the first electronic digital computer, the Eniac, in 1946.) \"You have to plan ahead and schedule everything so it's ready when you need it. Programming requires patience and the ability to handle detail. Women are 'naturals' at computer programming.\" Where did all the women go? The rise of the personal computer, Lewis argues, created the impression that computer programming was a solitary endeavor for creepy (male) loners. By the 1980s, only about one in five computer science majors were women. That trend is beginning to reverse itself -- today, it's around one in four -- but the erroneous idea that computer programming is and always has been \"for boys\" helps to keep those numbers down.

The annual tournament, which was founded in 1997 to foster innovation in artificial intelligence and robotics research, was held last week in Istanbul, Turkey. The key to victory, says Stone, was that he and his graduate and undergraduate students taught their robots to teach themselves. \u201cMost of the other teams used hand-coding,\u201d says Stone, associate professor of computer science . \u201cThey chose where to put the joints, how to tweak the walk. They tuned it by hand. We used the distributed computing cluster here in the department, which has hundreds of computers, in order to do machine learning. Every night we would have the robots practice. They would try walking one way and score themselves based on how quickly and how stably they could get to the ball and direct it toward the goal, and then the next night they\u2019d do it again, trying different approaches and refining the ones that worked. About three weeks before the competition we came up with this walk that was suddenly able to beat anything we could see from the other teams.\u201d The walk gave the UT Austin Villa players such an enormous advantage, says Stone, that he and his co-programmers were able to devote a considerable amount of each game to testing a pass-based strategy they knew would be less effective than the dribble-based strategy with which their robots scored most of their goals. \u201cWe were thinking about next year,\u201d says Stone. \u201cIf other teams catch up to us on the walk, which I think they will, then it\u2019ll be much more about passing and positioning.\u201d That kind of rapid advancement, says Stone, is the point of the Simulation League , which is the only one of the five leagues in the tournament that doesn\u2019t involve real nut-and-bolt robots. Instead, the games are played by two teams of nine autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The programs battle it out in a videogame-like environment. Each \u201cplayer\u201d has to react, in real time, to the data being sent to it by its teammates and by the simulator, which models the physics of the real world and is constantly recalculating its datastream based on where the 18 different players are going, when they\u2019re bumping into each other, when they\u2019re falling down and where they kick the ball. \u201cIt\u2019s one level abstracted away from the real world,\u201d says Stone, who also fields one of the top teams in the Standard Platform league . \u201cThe simulated robots don\u2019t have a vision sensor. Instead they\u2019re told their distance and angle from the ball and the goal, which is something you get from real robots only after some processing. They still have to figure out where they are on the field, however, and where their teammates are by combining data from each other. You still see them falling over when they get knocked into each other. They still have to learn how to walk, which is the biggest technical challenge in the real and simulation leagues.\u201d Because it\u2019s not nearly as expensive to test simulated robots, and because much of the experimentation can be done in the wee hours, without humans around to pick up the robots that fall down, there\u2019s more time and less cost to trying out new strategies. And because RoboCupSoccer is fundamentally an academic enterprise, dedicated to advancing science, the novel strategies that succeed are published in academic journals, inspiring other teams to incorporate the advances. \u201cWe actually introduced this idea of learning-based walks in the Standard Platform league back in 2004,\u201d says Stone, \u201cand everybody started using it. But then the tournament switched from robot dogs to robot humanoids, which are less stable, so people went back to hand coded methods. Now that we\u2019ve won the competition, I\u2019d be really surprised if at next year\u2019s competition there aren\u2019t several teams that are walking like this, in the simulation league at least, and possibly in the other leagues as well.\u201d The larger goal, says Stone, is one that\u2019s being accomplished every year, no matter who wins and loses. It\u2019s to improve the science and technology of autonomous robots so they can improve the world. With this broader goal in mind, RoboCup has expanded since its founding to include a variety of other tournaments. Teams in the RoboCupRescue tournament compete to master tasks that might aid in search and rescue in large-scale disaster situations. RoboCup@Home is oriented toward applications that can assist people in everyday life. And RoboCupJunior is for the kids (up to age 19). RoboCup has already changed the world, says Stone, who is on the board of trustees of the organization and has been competing since the beginning. Robots first developed for the competition were recently deployed in Fukushima, Japan, after the nuclear reactor disaster. One of the early winners of the RoboCupSoccer tournament, a professor from Cornell University, is the mastermind behind the robots that are now managing inventory and filling orders at the warehouses of companies like Amazon, Staples, Walgreens, Zappos and the Gap. It\u2019s likely to be a while, says Stone, until intelligent robots are ubiquitous in our lives, folding our laundry and unloading our dishwashers. But other aspects of a Jetsons-like future aren\u2019t so far off, he predicts. \u201cIf I had to guess about where robots are most likely to have a big real world impact, in the near future,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s on the roads. Autonomous cars . There\u2019s a clear task. Roads are well defined. The technology is getting close. There would be huge economic benefits, and huge social benefits in terms of allowing mobility to people who don\u2019t have it now.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Faculty Graduate Students Press Release Research Tags Peter Stone Artificial Intelligence",

The annual tournament, viewed as the world\u2019s biggest robotics and artificial intelligence event, was founded in 1997 and draws scientists and students from around the world. RoboCup teams consist of humanoid Nao robots, which are programmed by students to think and play the game, UT officials said. For the first time in the university\u2019s history, the Texas team won the RoboCupSoccer Standard Platform League competition \u2014 the highest profile league at RoboCup. The championships are a validation of the computer science department\u2019s research, said UT Professor Peter Stone, who led the UT team to victory. \u201cThe team includes research contributions from several of the students in my lab over a period of many years,\u201d Stone said. \u201cSince RoboCup is a very high-profile event in the international research community, it will also have a very positive impact on recruiting top undergraduate and graduate students in the coming years.\u201d UT Austin Villa\u2019s team includes Stone, doctoral students  Todd Hester,  Sam Barrett, Katie Genter, Piyush Khandelwal  ;and Jake Menashe, and master\u2019s student Yuchen He. While the team doesn\u2019t have direct commercial applications, over the years RoboCup has generated spinoff technologies. UT\u2019s robots are made by French firm Aldebaran.

Ferner Cilloniz (not pictured), Sarah Imboden, Adam Setapen and Drake Dowsett will be awarded their Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer Science degrees simultaneously on Saturday, May 22nd. These highly motivated students completed 12 hours of graduate coursework in the senior year of their Bachelor of Science degrees. \u201cIt was weird at first being an undergraduate in a graduate class, until I realized they\u2019re not that different from me,\u201d commented Drake. The following year, they were full-fledged graduate students in their fifth year. The primary goals of the integrated program are to better prepare students for competitive Ph.D. programs and provide stronger technical depth to students entering professional positions. Adam said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to get my Ph.D. right away, so I had an extra year to focus on my research. It also confirmed that I did want to get my Ph.D.\u201d Sarah noted, \u201cWhen I was in my job interview, I thought \u2018Hey, I\u2019m equipped for this job\u2019.\u201d Dr. Bruce Porter commented that there is a more significant salary differential between the BS and MS than there is between the MS and the Ph.D. Since becoming chair of the department, Dr. Porter has continually emphasized the strong employment opportunities for computer science majors: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/oea/press_desk/utcs_spotlights/2010/want_a_job/ Sarah will take her degrees in computer science, along with her digital arts & media certification from the Bridging Disciplines Program to Apple in California; Drake will continue his work with Intel here in Austin; and Adam will go on to pursue his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If you are interested joining these prestigious graduates, you are encouraged to apply for the Five-Year Integrated Program. Applications are open only to current, degree-seeking computer science majors at the University of Texas at Austin. There will be information session in Fall 2010, but students are welcome to contact one of the undergraduate academic advisors, Rob Poynor and Jennifer Martinson, at (512) 471-9509 for more information.

The goal of the Nell Dale Mentor Program is to increase the number of Women in computer science and retain women in this major. WiCS is striving to have one upperclassman become a mentor for one to two mentees, including freshmen and transfer students. WiCS members are hopeful that a mentor/mentee relationship with another female will be help in sustaining the female population in a male dominated major. Image The women of WiCS chose Dr. Nell Dale as their mentor program\u2019s namesake because they felt she would be a perfect fit for what they are trying to accomplish. \u201cI am humbled and honored to have the group named after me. I am thrilled by their goals and enthusiasm. Having a critical mass of colleagues is very important: much more so for females than for males. It dispels the myth of the lone hacker surrounded by empty paper coffee cups working into the early morning hours,\u201d says Dr. Dale. She is an internationally recognized leader in computer science education research, an award recipient, author of many programming textbooks and mentor to thousands of students. A retired Senior Lecturer from the UTCS, Dr. Dale earned her undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University of Houston, and her M.A. in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Computer Science from UT. In addition, she earned the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award in 2001. Image Dr. Dale's leadership role in the Women in Science Program, funded by the National Science Foundation, enhanced career opportunities for hundreds of women who have science degrees but were unemployed or underemployed. \u201cI remember checking my gender as male on a teacher evaluation form: I was the only female in the class and wanted to be anonymous. The ratio of men to women in CS is still too one sided, but at least the ratio is measurable. As a young teacher, I remember joining a women's group at the church to be able to talk with other females, because both the majority of the students and all the other faculty members were male. I felt no prejudice, just a sense of isolation. Thank heavens those days are past.\u201d Through her mentoring programs, a large number of these women retrained in computing science programs, and returned to the workforce as educators in computing and information disciplines. Dr. Dale served on the faculty of the university for more than 25 years. She retired from full-time teaching in the summer of 2000, and now spends her time writing, traveling and playing tennis. Dr. Dale\u2019s advice for the next generation of female computer scientists: \u201cGrasp all opportunities and don't be intimated by anyone. Men tend to plan their careers; women seem to fall into theirs. Decide what you want to do and be and then go for it. Plan your path but be flexible.\" News Categories Undergraduate Students Outreach Tags Women in Computer Science Nell Dale Mentor Program Nell Dale",

    "text_content": "Computer Vision - Seeing Anew | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Vision - Seeing Anew Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, August 4, 2010 Every day\u2014every minute, every second\u2014the world\u2019s computers are amassing visual information at an extraordinary rate. Aspiring Tarantinos are sending their two-minute videos to Youtube in the hopes of going viral. Mom and Dad are uploading their Napa Valley vacation photos to Flickr. Doctors are sending patient MRIs to medical databases, and satellites are scanning the earth for evidence of sinister activity. Image Dr. Kristen Grauman works at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. And every day people like Kristen Grauman are searching for ways to help computers sift through this avalanche of visual information so that someday our computers might be as good at analyzing visual data as they are, right now, at dealing with textual data. \u201cIt\u2019s a young and very unsolved area, so there\u2019s a lot of room for big improvements,\u201d says Grauman, an assistant professor of computer science. \u201cWe can get much better with video surveillance, medical image analysis, face recognition, autonomous robotics. As we move forward, we will find new ways to search large repositories of images and video, to connect to information based on visual cues. \u201cImagine you\u2019re out hiking and you see some unfamiliar plant or animal you want to learn about. You just take a picture with your mobile device and it connects you right to information based purely on what it looks like. Automatic annotation will be powerful on these web applications like Flickr, when we can index images by visual content. There will be more summarization of video based on the visual content, so if I have a massive collection of video, the system can automatically summarize what\u2019s happening and can search for content that\u2019s relevant.\u201d Among the kinds of advances that have already been made by the field, says Grauman, are programs that can learn to recognize common objects in such a way that they can pick out different instances of those objects in a wide variety of settings, sizes and orientations. Given a unique object\u2014the Eiffel Tower, say, or the U.S. Capitol\u2014such programs can be nearly as good at finding matches as a human being. The more regular the texture and the layout of the objects, she says, the more robustly detectable they\u2019re likely to be, with common categories like faces, pedestrians, and cars being particularly well suited to automated identification. \u201cYou start with a bucket of images, and you run filters,\u201d says Grauman. \u201cYou find out where the edges and contours are. You extract vectored descriptions of color, texture, and shape. You\u2019re looking for themes in the data, local patches of description that are repeated, geometries that match. Given these representations, we can employ machine learning algorithms to extract models to distinguish between different categories. Over time, as the algorithm receives more human supervision in the form of labeled examples, the descriptions of objects that are encoded in the programs get better and better.\u201d Image Instead of just giving a program a batch of millions of images and asking it to look for visual patterns and themes that recur in different images, Grauman and her graduate students give their program the specs for things it already knows\u2014a house, say, and a driveway\u2014 and asks it to look for patterns that seem to cluster around that thing. Considerable strides have been made as well, says Grauman, in the area of face recognition and detection\u2014which is why, for instance, national security agencies can quickly scan through thousands of hours of security camera footage, and tens of thousands of faces, for suspected criminals or terrorists. The resources that have gone into creating good face recognition software, however, and the limitations of even the best programs, highlight the great distance the field has left to progress. \u201cThe reality is that the best face detectors are the ones that have been training, with significant human interaction, on millions of examples,\u201d says Grauman. \u201cYou can\u2019t dedicate that kind of effort to training software for every one of the 30,000 categories of common objects that you and I can name immediately.\u201d One of the big challenges, then, is how to teach programs to analyze visual content when you can\u2019t depend on the extraordinary human energies that have been devoted (for obvious reasons) to face recognition. This is where Grauman\u2019s research comes in. In one recent project, for instance, Grauman and her graduate students looked to see whether they could leverage what\u2019s already known about certain categories of objects to prime a program to identify new, previously unclassified objects. Instead of just giving a program a batch of millions of images and asking it to look for visual patterns and themes that recur in different images, Grauman gives the program the specs for something it already knows\u2014a car, say\u2014and asks it to look for patterns that seem to cluster around that thing. Once these patterns near the car are identified, a human can look at them and, very quickly, categorize them as \u201croad\u201d or \u201cstreetlight\u201d or \u201cbuilding.\u201d Then the program can start again, with an expanded repertoire of known objects, searching for new objects. \u201cThe idea,\u201d says Grauman, \u201cis don\u2019t do it from scratch and don\u2019t ignore what you already know. Previous approaches to unsupervised visual discovery attempted to find new categories based only on what the things looked like, and often that\u2019s just too much to ask. It\u2019s more reasonable to ask the system to discover these new things in the context of the old ones with which it\u2019s already familiar.\u201d Such a program, says Grauman, lies toward the less supervised end of the machine learning spectrum. It\u2019s mostly on its own, searching through images and identifying patterns. Grauman is also working, however, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of programs that rely on more human input. Another one of Grauman\u2019s projects relies on an initial effort from human annotators, who look at photos and provide a list of the some of the objects in each image, in order to boost the speed and efficacy of visual detection programs. \u201cIt turns out we look at images and notice things in a certain way,\u201d says Grauman, \u201cand there turns out to be implicit information in the lists of words that the humans didn\u2019t even know they were providing. If you list a word first, for instance, that often suggests that it\u2019s fairly prominent in the picture. Objects that are close to each other on the list are more likely to be close to each other in the image. We have shown that by letting the system learn these implicit cues, it can provide faster and more accurate object detection on novel images.\u201d Over the long haul, says Grauman, it\u2019s this kind of fusion\u2014of human and computers, and of visual, textual and audio data streams\u2014that may give rise to the most powerful methods of searching, organizing and analyzing the digital world.

This year's lecture took place from 4:00 - 5:30 p.m. in the Avaya Auditorium, ACES 2.302. Watch the 2010 Visions of Computing Lecture! Chandrajit Bajaj - \"Accelerating Scientific Discovery\" Image Computational screening is the name given to the computer docking of three-dimensional models of drug-like compounds into models of potential drug targets, usually proteins. Clearly, this computational method is far faster and cheaper than actually testing tens of thousands of potential drugs, which has been a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for generations. The rate limiting computational step however, and in the inner loop of the search, is the accurate computation of molecular configuration dependent relative binding affinities. My research grand challenge of this decade has been to design advanced molecular modeling/recognition techniques, so as to develop the fastest and most accurate modern computational screening engine to look for inhibitors of virulent target proteins. In this talk I shall briefly describe the design of (1+epsilon) approximation algorithms based on the fast multipole and non-uniform fast Fourier transform, coupled to O(1) time spherical neighborhood query data-structures, that achieve linear time solutions for all the compute intensive terms of molecular binding affinities. These algorithms are being encapsulated in a freely available internet search/scoring engine called F2+ Gsol_Dock (Fast Fourier Docking with Solvation Energetics).

Nell Dale - \"Computer Science Education: 1960 - 2010\" Image Retired Professor Nell Dale - The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer ScienceMy undergraduate career in computing began with a senior electrical engineering course in 1960, for which there were no prerequisites. During the next fifty years, computer science education has gone through many transformation and numerous curriculum documents. Are we any closer to a consensus as to what to teach and how to teach it than those pioneers were in 1960? This question will be examined in light of my 50 year involvement in CS education. About Nell Dale Dr. Nell B. Dale was one of the first women to get a Ph.D. in Computer Science in the early 1970s. She graduated from the University of Texas Department of Computer Sciences and remained on the faculty until her retirement from full-time teaching in 2000. She was originator and director of the Women in Science Program in the early '80s and has been a mentor to students and colleagues throughout her career. Her research interests have focused on computer science education as an academic discipline, having co-chaired five dissertations in the area. During her career she has authored or co-authored 18 textbooks, many in multiple editions. Dr. Dale has received the prestigious SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education and was the first woman to receive the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)'s prestigious Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. She has won two Hamilton Awards for the best textbook published at UT in a given year. She has received the ABACUS Award from Upsilon Pi Epsilon, Honor Society for the Computing Sciences and was elected a Fellow of the ACM. She received a Doctor of Science, honoris causa, from Sewanee, The University of the South. Kathryn McKinley - \"A Better Space-Time Tradeoff\" Image Professor Kathryn McKinley - The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer ScienceMemory and computation define computer performance. Programmers explicitly make many space-time tradeoffs, and automated memory managers (i.e., garbage collectors) make this tradeoff for programmers in the high-level languages that now dominate the application landscape. By 1970 researchers had proposed the three canonical algorithms in use today: semi-space copying, mark-compact, and mark-sweep. Unfortunately, each one sacrifices either: space efficiency, fast reclamation, or mutator performance. We describe mark-region, a new canonical algorithm with configurations that meet all three performance objectives at once. Its memory efficiency and performance properties make it well suited to meet the now urgent demands of and for parallel software. Without many such mechanisms, the performance improvement train is on target to derail, taking with it the computing innovation ecosystem. About Kathryn McKinley Professor McKinley holds an Endowed Professorship in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. She received her Ph.D. from Rice University working with Ken Kennedy. Her research interests include compilers, memory management, runtime systems, programming languages, security, reliability, and architecture. She and her collaborators have produced tools based on their research that are in wide research and industrial use: the DaCapo Java Benchmarks, TRIPS Compiler, Hoard memory manager, MMTk garbage collector toolkit, and the Immix mark-region garbage collector. McKinley has graduated fourteen PhD students. Her service includes program chair for ASPLOS '04, PACT '05, and PLDI '07; co-Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Programming Language Systems (TOPLAS) (2007-2010); and CRA-W board member (2009-present). McKinley has received an NSF CAREER award, IBM Faculty awards, outreach awards, and best paper awards. She is an ACM Fellow. Keshav Pingali - \"Parallel Programming Needs New Foundations\" Image Professor Keshav Pingali - The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer ScienceIn spite of more than thirty years of research, parallel programming is extremely complicated and remains a job for expert programmers. Therefore, most software packages are sequential and do not take advantage of the multicore processors that are now ubiquitous. In this talk, I will argue that the solution to the problem of parallel programming lies in fundamentally changing the abstractions that we currently use to think about parallelism. I will also describe a system called Galois for multicore programming that is based on these insights. About Keshav Pingali Keshav Pingali is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, and he holds the W.A. \"Tex\" Moncrief Chair of Computing in the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at UT Austin. He was on the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University from 1986 to 2006, where he held the India Chair of Computer Science. Pingali's research has focused on programming languages and compiler technology for program understanding, restructuring, and optimization. Pingali is a Fellow of the IEEE and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He serves on the NSF CISE Advisory Committee. Details at: 1. Parking 2.

    "text_content": "Computer Science a Growth Field | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science a Growth Field Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, February 22, 2010 \"Want a Job? Get a Computer Science Degree\" By Carolyn Duffy Marsan, Network World February 22, 2010 12:04 AM ET Slideshow: 10 hot computer science schools Image That's the advice coming out of the top U.S. computer science programs, which are seeing rising enrollment and applications as more college students discover that their job prospects are better \u2014 and their starting salaries higher \u2014 if they have a computer-related degree. Leading universities report that enrollment in computer science and engineering courses is up significantly this year among students pursuing computer science majors as well as those studying other subjects, particularly science or business. \"I think the job market is what's driving the growth,\" says Professor Bruce Porter, Chair of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, which has seen its enrollment increase more than 5% this year. \"The government has made it clear that computer science is a growth field, and I think that message is getting back to students and their parents.\" Corporate recruitment of top computer science grads has remained steady throughout the economic downturn. Last spring, at the height of the recession, Georgia Tech's College of Computing had the highest job placement rate of any major on campus and the highest starting salary. \"We had placed 87% of our undergraduates in jobs as of last spring,\" says Cedric Stallworth, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Enrollment at Georgia Tech's College of Computing. \"The financial sector \u2014 credit card companies, insurance companies \u2014 are very much interested in computer science students, as are defense companies and software development and networking companies.\" Computer science grads from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are being recruited by software, healthcare, trading and agricultural companies. Last year's grads received an average of 2.3 job offers and had an average starting salary of more than $72,000 \u2013 the highest of any starting salary in the university's College of Engineering. \"We really didn't see a drop in recruiting efforts,\" says Cynthia Coleman, associate director of external relations for the University of Illinois' Department of Computer Science. \"We have seen a significant increase in companies in other industries that typically haven't recruited in computer science interested in our students. What a lot of our students are going to realize is that every industry has computer science needs.\" Solid job prospects The message about solid job prospects and starting salaries as high as $105,000 for computer science majors is resonating with college students and their parents. At Stanford University, the number of students declaring themselves as computer science majors is up 40% from last year. The university attributes this dramatic rise partly to the fact that its required computer science courses were streamlined and more areas of concentration added. But the rest of the increase is attributed to the recession. \"We surveyed our students to see why they declared computer science as their major,\" says Professor Mehran Sahami, associate chair for education in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. \"What we found is that half of the increase was from the change in our curriculum and the other half was from macro-economic conditions. Especially in these challenging economic times, students consider computer science a safer choice.\" More than half of Stanford's undergraduate students are taking the department's introductory computer science class this year. This represents an increase of 20% over last year. \"We will probably have 800 students take it this year,\" Sahami says. \"Our students do believe that having some computing skills will be useful in other fields, whether in a scientific field where they see the immediate applicability in simulations or longer-term, where they think it's a good skill to have.\" Computer science is not only a more popular major, it's also a more popular field of study for students majoring in something else. At the University of Illinois, for example, informatics is now the most popular minor on campus. \"Everybody is realizing that IT is going to be important in the marketplace, and they are looking to beef up their resumes with some kind of certificate or qualification that would give them an edge,\" says Professor Lenny Pitt, Director of Undergraduate Programs for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois. Computer Science Major is Cool Again The interest in computer science courses is especially strong among students pursuing science-related majors. \"Computational biology, computational medicine \u2013 computation is just invading so many other disciplines,\" Porter says. \"What we're seeing is that a number of students have a fundamental interest in astronomy or biology or chemistry, and they see computer science as playing a key role in that field.\" Computer science also is a back-up for business students who once may have pursued lucrative jobs in investment banking. \"Last year, a bunch of students saw that maybe not all the interesting jobs in the world are in the financial industry,\" says Professor Andrew Appel, Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. \"It used to be that a good portion of our computer science majors went to Wall Street. Last year, fewer went to Wall Street\u2026Maybe there was a little scrambling, but we didn't have a problem with unemployed graduates last year.\" Applications rise The trend will continue next year, as applications to top computer science programs pour in. The University of Illinois says the number of applicants to its Department of Computer Science is up 26% from last year to 860. \"The projections that have come out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have indicated a relative cornucopia of jobs in the near term for computer science majors,\" Pitt says. \"Parents may well be aware of the job opportunities in the IT industry, which is suffering the least despite the downturn.\" At Carnegie Mellon University, the number of applicants to the School of Computer Science's Computer Science Department reached 3,000 this year, up 14% from last year and up 76% from 2005. The department caps enrollment at 130 students per year for a total enrollment of fewer than 550 students. \"We're getting very close to the peak, which was 3,237 applications in 2001,\" says Catherine Fichtner, program coordinator for undergraduate education in the Computer Science Department at CMU's School of Computer Science. One reason applications are up at CMU's computer science program: high starting salaries. The median starting salary for 2009 graduates was $80,000, with the highest reported salary at $105,000. \"Our salaries were pretty consistent last year,\" Fichtner says. \"Our students have always been able to find jobs, and 30% of our students go on to graduate school.\" Applications are up 5% this year at Georgia Tech's College of Computing, which currently has 900 students. \"Historically, this was perceived as just for the nerds. But now it's perceived as something everybody can get involved in,\" Stallworth says. \"Our students are looking to solve problems in their lives, and they feel now that technologies can help them do that.\" Not another dot-com boom Enrollment in computer science programs has been rising since 2005, when parents and students stopped worrying that corporate outsourcing of IT functions would result in less demand for computer scientists in the United States. But it hasn't reached dot-com era levels. \"We feel that the bust is over, and the number of computer science students is going to keep increasing,'' says Kate Riley, director of operations for the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at UC Berkeley. Undergraduate enrollment in UC Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department's degree program is 929 students, up 8% from last year. Another 120 liberal arts students are enrolled as computer science majors, up 9% from a year ago. \"We're spending a lot of time developing new courses and focusing more on industry,\" Riley says. \"Berkeley is a research school, and that has been our focus for our graduate students, but now we're looking more toward industry partnerships for our undergraduates.\" None of the top computer science programs are as big as they were during the dot-com boom. School administrators say they aren't sure they want to grow that large again. \"At our high point, we were at about 2,400 majors. Now we're at 948,\" Porter says of the University of Texas' computer science program. \"We're not aiming to get back to 2,400. That was beyond what we could manage\u2026Our goal is to get back to 1,400.\" News Categories Undergraduate Program",

It has been a year of remarkable change, with enrollment numbers hitting all time highs, new faculty joining our ranks, President Barack Obama visiting with our students, and, at long last, the opening of the brand new Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall. Since then, the UT Computer Science population has surged past 2,000 undergraduates--more than triple the enrollments when I started as chair five years ago--easily making us the largest computer science department among the nation\u2019s top ten ranked programs. Image The Gates Complex and Dell Hall serve as a timely physical symbol of how far we have come as a department. After thirty years with this university, seeing our students in a state-of-the art facility like this one gives me a sense of both pride and gratitude. For those of you who have not yet seen the space, it is a modern, 140,000 square foot complex consisting of two buildings connected by a central atrium and a six-story grand staircase. Our students enjoy classrooms equipped with the latest educational technology and flexible setups that can be modified to accommodate flipped classrooms and other modern pedagogical approaches that are well-suited to our newly overhauled curriculum. Our faculty and graduate students now work together in tight-knit, collaborative research clusters, with each research group enjoying their own dedicated lab space. The stunning architecture embraces both form and function, allowing its residents to enjoy the building\u2019s aesthetic while also taking advantage of facilities that make collaboration and organization seamless. The building was designed for aggressive growth, giving us the space to hire new faculty as we continue to build one of the brightest collections of minds in computer science research and education. It truly is a facility second to none. The energy created by these new facilities is also reflected in the new programs and partnerships embraced by the department. Last spring, President Obama came to Austin, and one of the stops on his trip involved visiting with students in the Longhorn Startup Program. LHS is a joint venture between UT Computer Science and Engineering that allows our students to take great ideas and turn them into great businesses like Lynx Laboratories\u2014a company founded by UT students who created the software to power a 3D camera that promises to revolutionize digital imaging. It is this type of ingenuity that has given our students a reputation that makes them in such high demand on the job market. By graduation last May, over 95% of our undergraduates had accepted offers for graduate school or full-time employment, with many of them going to work for some of industry\u2019s most in-demand companies. If you are one of our alumni, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to reconnect with us. We recently kicked off efforts to organize alumni activities in Austin, Houston, Dallas, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area. I hope to see you at an event there soon. And to all of our alumni and friends, I want to extend an invitation to visit us at our new home in the Gates Complex. We welcome the opportunity to show you the facilities and highlight for you in person why you have every reason to be proud of your legacy at The University of Texas at Austin.",

Image The center, titled \"BEACON: Study of Evolution in Action,\" is one of five highly coveted Science and Technology Centers recently established by the NSF. It is a joint effort by Michigan State University, The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Washington, the University of Idaho and North Carolina A&T State University. BEACON is short for the \"Bio/computational Evolution in Action Consortium.\" In contrast to evolutionary studies focusing on fossil records or comparing DNA among species to discover common ancestry, BEACON scientists will focus on evolution as an ongoing process. They will use organisms in laboratories and at field sites, and use \"digital organisms\" undergoing real evolution on computers. \"The goal of the project is to transfer knowledge about biological mechanisms to engineering and computer science,\" said Risto Miikkulainen , professor in the Department of Computer Science . \"On the other hand, we will use digital evolution to gain insight into biological phenomena that would be difficult or impossible to study in the laboratory.\" BEACON will be a resource for academia and industry, performing basic research while helping create new technologies to solve scientific problems, ranging from the development of safer, more efficient cars to systems that detect computer intrusions. In addition, the goal of the center is to educate a generation of multidisciplinary scientists and improve public understanding of evolution at all levels. The University of Texas at Austin BEACON team includes Miikkulainen (Department of Computer Science), David Hillis, Lauren Ancel Meyers and Claus Wilke (Section of Integrative Biology) and Andrew Ellington (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry). The approximately $2.5 million of initial BEACON funding for The University of Texas at Austin will be used to support interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research projects, graduate training, undergraduate research through the Freshman Research Initiative , and outreach to high schools and the public through the Texas Memorial Museum .

Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, February 16, 2011 Elementary, my dear Watson! \"What is IBM\u2019s question-answer system?\" Image Meet Watson Watson, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, is the world\u2019s most advanced question-answer system. It uses breakthrough analytics to understand what is being asked, analyze massive amounts of data, and provide the best answer based on the evidence it finds. A core team of 25 IBM programmers developed the system and software. They downloaded information from books, movie scripts, encyclopedias, textbooks, news archives, the complete works of Shakespeare and the Bible to Watson\u2019s brain chip, a Power7 processor\u2014primarily designed in Austin. UTCS Advances Watson Three UTCS faculty, along with faculty from seven other universities, worked with IBM to advance the capabilities of Watson. UTCS\u2019s Ken Barker, Bruce Porter and Ray Mooney will be guests at a special Jeopardy! viewing event at the IBM Austin campus on February 16th. Department Chair Bruce Porter is working on \u201cautomated reasoning\u201d and automated question-answer technology. His group of researchers, including Dr. Ken Barker, is working to extend the capabilities of Watson, with a focus on extensive common sense knowledge. The objective is to help the system answer questions by developing a computational resource of common sense knowledge. Research Scientist Ken Barker is working on an extension of Watson technology for a project focusing on machine reading, or automated reading and comprehension of natural language. Professor Raymond Mooney\u2019s research group is developing computational methods for processing text, focusing on systems that automatically learn to map language into a logical representation of its meaning. Professor Mooney developed methods that learn to extract knowledge from text\u2014a key requirement for the Watson system. The Challenge At the contestant\u2019s podium, Watson is pitted against two of the best Jeopardy! players of all time. Ken Jennings holds the record for most consecutive wins at 74 games won with $2.52 million in winnings; Brad Rutter has a total of $3.2M in winnings. Host Alex Trebek reads a question out loud while Watson receives input in text form\u2014no speech recognition software is used. Watson moves at lightning speed thanks to a Power 750 server (also primarily designed in Austin)\u2014a cluster of 750s housed in 10 computer racks, 16 terabytes of memory\u2014the equivalent of one million books\u2019 worth of information, and 3,000 cores running simultaneously to parse information against a vast database, find several-hundred candidate answers, score them by thousands of algorithms, and compare the highest score against a threshold. When Alex finishes speaking, a light signals that the buzzers are open. Watson receives an electronic signal at the same moment and can reveal it\u2019s most preferred answer in seconds, while a typical PC would require about two hours for the same process. Watson will only buzz in if it has an answer with a high enough score in time. The kind of questions that make Jeopardy! interesting are full of insinuations, obscurity and witticisms. Language comes naturally to people, because we think in words and phrases. Computers, zeros and ones at their foundation, process information mathematically. Formal mathematics doesn\u2019t exist for everyday language, explains Dr. David Ferrucci, program manager of the Watson project. IBM is looking for commercial applications for Watson. Dr. David Ferrucci says, \"The success of the Jeopardy! challenge will break barriers associated with profound effects on science, technology and business.\u201d Challenge televised on KXAN-TV February 14-16 at 4:30 p.m. Additional Press http://www.kxan.com/dpps/news/strange/jeopardy-to-pit-humans-against-ibm-machine-ob10-jgr_3677742 http://www.kxan.com/dpps/news/strange/ibm-computer-taking-on-jeopardy-champs-for-1million-ob11-jgr_3696444 http://www.kxan.com/dpps/entertainment/television/computer-bests-humans-on-jeopardy-nt11-jgr_3721260 http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/emerging-tech/2011/02/11/ibm-to-collaborate-with-universities-on-watsons-qa-tech-40091763/ http://www.slate.com/id/2284721/ http://www.dailytexanonline.com/content/two-jeopardy-champions-contend-ai-computer http://www.dailytexanonline.com/content/ibm-computer-wins-jeopardy-match-against-champions http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2011/feb/13/is-game-wave-of-the-future/ http://www.utexas.edu/know/2011/02/11/jeopardy_watson/?AddInterest=1284 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9210319/Brain_behind_IBM_s_Watson_not_unlike_a_human_s?taxonomyId=12 Sources Andrews, C., IBM Announces Eight Universities Contributing to the Watson Computing System's Development, http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-announces-eight-universities-contributing-to-the-watson-computing-systems-development-115892914.html (February 11, 2011) Berwald, J., IBM puts supercomputer in 'Jeopardy!', http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-02-ibm-supercomputer-jeopardy.html (February 8, 2011).

    "text_content": "Robots Play Winning Soccer | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Robots Play Winning Soccer Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, July 3, 2009 Image Texas Computer Science students are programming robots to play soccer... and winning. Current robots are only 2-feet high, but the goal is to develop robotic players large and skillful enough to beat a real-live World Cup team by 2050. Students from Texas Tech (TT) and The University of Texas at Austin (UT) use C++ to program robots to play without human interaction during the games. The robots play as a team and make individual decisions. Student programmers are members of the TT and UT Austin Villa, a cross-institutional team that helps students solve real-world problems in artificial intelligence. UT professor Peter Stone, TT professor Mohan Sridharan (UT-Ph.D. '07), and UT Postdoc Dr. Michael Quinlan lead the team in the Standard Platform League (SPL). In the SPL, each team competes with identical Aldebaran Nao robots. Since the hardware is identical for all teams, the focus is on the programming. Image \"I have been involved with soccer most of my life,'' says Stone. \"I played on my college team and some semi-pro. While I was in graduate school at Carnegie Mellon, I combined my interest in soccer and technology by co-founding a robot soccer team. It sounds frivolous, but it takes advanced programming skills to play robot soccer. Small variations in lighting can totally throw a player's ability to accurately perceive its surroundings. Movement has to be stable and fast with quick direction changes. It's quite a challenge.'' Students compete in simulated and real robot soccer. The robots are programmed to sense their environments, make a decision about which action to execute, execute it, then determine if the action was successful. In research terms, they are interacting as independent agents in a multiagent system and learning through trial and error\u2014or through reinforcment learning. Image \"Put simply, our robots need to work as a team,'' says Stone. \"It is it not enough for each robot to want to score a goal\u2014if we did that, there would be just a big pile of robots trying to get the ball. Our robots need to work with each other, and against the other team, at the same time.'' Stone still plays winning soccer.

This is the first time since 2008, when NACE began tracking offer rates its annual Student Survey, that computer science majors have topped the list. In previous surveys, accounting majors had the highest offer rate. In NACE\u2019s 2011 Student Survey , however, accounting majors came in second, with 53.8 percent of those who have applied for jobs receiving offers. \u201cThe difference between the two majors is that the offer rate for computer science majors has increased 13.8 percentage points this year, while the offer rate for accounting majors is up 8.3 percentage points,\u201d says Marilyn Mackes, NACE executive director. Meanwhile, economics (50.9 percent offer rate) and engineering (50 percent) majors also saw strong offer rates. Conversely, education (19.5 percent), English (23.5 percent), and healthcare (28.7 percent) had weak offer rates. The offer rates for all of these majors dropped from last year; healthcare (-8.4 percentage points) saw the biggest decline followed by English (-5.6 percentage points) and education (-2.8 percentage points). Overall, job offers are up. This year, 41.2 percent of the members of the current class who applied for a job have received at least one offer, compared with 38.2 percent of the Class of 2010 at this time last year. Image About the 2011 Student Survey: Each year, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) surveys college students on their job search, career plans, and other issues related to employment. This year, the survey was conducted mid-February through April 30, 2011. More than 50,000 students nationwide, including nearly 20,000 graduating seniors, took part in this year\u2019s survey. Information in this release is based on data gathered from graduating senior respondents.

    "text_content": "Get Started at UT | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Get Started at UT Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, December 16, 2011 In the Red McCombs End Zone Club, undergrad students, many dressed in suits, are clustered together hovering over laptops with a sense of urgency and nervous energy. Outside the window the club\u2019s occupants can see the Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium\u2019s video board. But this time, it\u2019s not sports on the screen, it\u2019s the 1 Semester Startup logo\u2014 entrepreneurial athletes. These undergrads are feverishly going over the pitches for their startups that they are about to deliver in front of a room full of classmates, professors, mentors and potential investors. All of the work they\u2019ve put in over the semester has lead to this moment\u2014Demo Day. Image Just about every startup at Demo Day and in the One-semester Startup class has a computer science influence, if not completely orbiting around computer science. The startup teams are interdisciplinary, bringing together engineers with geologists, computer scientists with educators, business majors and biologists, for example. Let\u2019s look at a few examples of this marriage between different disciplines. Andrew Miller, a Computer Science major, and Ian Beckham, a Business major, teamed up to create Homeroom. Homeroom fills the gaps left by software like Blackboard, Moodle, and Sakai that are used by thousands of colleges and universities to help their professors and students manage their coursework. Unlike the competition, Homeroom has easy to use features including live online chat, automatically generated agendas, and collaboration tools. Homeroom is being developed with the input of professors and students by facilitating communication and helping students organize their busy academic workloads. PurpleSight is another example of this interdisciplinary partnership. Computer Science major Bryant Son and Economics major Tony Mataya developed PurpleSight - a startup focused on building technology that will make consuming, aggregating, and analyzing political news more efficient for its users. Their vision is to modernize the way political campaigns operate by creating innovative, turn-key solutions. Computer Science major Duy Tran has partnered with Business major Jonathan Van to develop an online hub for entrepreneurs. uThinkTank is making it easier for student entrepreneurs to start a company by connecting them to cofounders, free professional guidance, and all the resources possibly needed to go from idea to company. They are currently building the online hub for the IC2 Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. Nick Johnson, a Computer Science major who graduated three days after Demo Day, and his partner Justin Callan, a Business Economics major, presented their pitch f or Beagle Capital . Beagle Capital builds technology that uses genetic algorithms to find successful stock market strategies. They combine machine learning and quantitative finance techniques to evaluate millions of potential stock market strategies. Nick and Justin are currently talking to local Austin trading companies about potential partnerships. These are just a few examples of the innovative startups the students presented at Demo Day a s a wrap up to their semester in 1 Semester Startup. About Demo Day Twenty undergraduate student startups from The University of Texas at Austin presented five-minute investor pitches to the Austin entrepreneurial community on Thursday, December 1st. The startups were part of the first 1 Semester Startup (1SS) class at the university. Demo Day sponsors: the Murchison Chair of Free Enterprise, Capital Factory, the Kauffman Foundation, Austin Ventures, G-51 Capital and S3 Ventures About 1 Semester Startup 1 Semester Startup (ISS) is a new practicum course designed to accelerate UT undergraduate students\u2019 startups for degree credit. It allows undergraduates to experience entrepreneurship first-hand while learning from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in Austin. Computer Science Chair Bruce Porter, inspired by the weekend-long entrepreneurship event 3-Day Startup (3DS), collaborated with Josh Baer and Bob Metcalfe to create the innovative course. \u201cI decided to take 1SS because I was already starting a business around this technology I had built, and I thought working with the professors and mentors would really help expand my network. It has helped me far beyond anything I was expecting. It accelerated the progress of my business substantially, and helped me to focus my efforts.\u201d \u2013 Nick Johnson of Beagle Capital Instructors Joshua Baer of Capital Factory and the Department of Computer Science; John Butler of IC2 and the McCombs School of Business; and Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, founder of 3Com and the Cockrell School's Murchison Fellow of Free Enterprise, all bring their own perspective, experience and insights to the class. \u201cThis class has been an amazing opportunity to explore entrepreneurship. Professor Metcalfe, Baer, and each of the great mentors who spoke to our class inspired us all to dive in headfirst and really experience startup culture. We are very lucky to have had them offer their time to us undergraduates, and I hope that the university will continue to realize the value of fostering innovation among its students.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Miller of Homeroom Students from across disciplines, including computer science, engineering, education and business, advanced their startup companies during ISS. Students had to find co-founders, develop an elevator pitch and talk to customers. They also heard from local entrepreneurs including: Michael Dell, founder of Dell Inc.; Jason Cohen, founder of WPEngine; Ash Maurya, founder of Spark59; and Frank Moss, former director of MIT's Media Lab and former CEO of Tivoli System. \u201cI simply loved the fact that I had an opportunity to meet and to compete with some of the best students from the School of Natural Sciences, McCombs Business School, and Cockrell School of Engineering. I also loved how they invited actual CEOs and senior leaders of the startup companies to become our instructors, mentors, and speakers.\u201d - Bryant Son of PurpleSight The class is also made possible by Teaching Assistants Joel Hestness and Jonathan Spillman, volunteers like alumnus Jason Nolasc and the many mentors that dedicated their time and energy to support these students. The Austin small business community has been very supportive of 1SS. Local businesses Bazaarvoice , Capital Factory, HomeAway , Indeed.com, OtherInbox, Silverton, and Spiceworks even had pizza delivered to the classes to help support their efforts. 1SS is looking for mentors - successful entrepreneurs in the Austin community who can donate one hour a week to guide the next generation of entrepreneurs. If you are interested in becoming a mentor or volunteering your time, please contact 1SS . News Categories Undergraduate Program Undergraduate Students Tags entrepreneurship 1 Semester Startup",

    "text_content": "Neural Network Systems | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Neural Network Systems Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, May 4, 2009 Image Uli Grasemann and Risto Miikkulainen aren\u2019t the first computer scientists to use neural network systems to model what might be going on inside a schizophrenic brain. They\u2019ve had an advantage, however, that others have lacked. Their neural network system, DISCERN , can understand and produce natural language. Working with Ralph Hoffman, a psychiatrist at Yale, Grasemann and Miikulainen have also been able to pair their neural network results with a study of human schizophrenics, and the similarities have been striking. \u201cIn other models of schizophrenia , there\u2019s no direct link to the symptoms,\u201d says Grasemann, a doctoral student in Miikkulainen\u2019s lab. \u201cThat\u2019s the big difference. We actually have language.\u201d As a result, when they found a way to model the excessive release of dopamine in the brain, they got a neural network that recalled memories in a distinctly schizophrenic-like fashion. \u201cThe hypothesis is that dopamine encodes the importance\u2014the salience\u2014of experience,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cWhen there\u2019s too much dopamine, it leads to this exaggerated salience, and the brain ends up learning from things that it shouldn\u2019t be learning from.\u201d According to this \u201chyperlearning\u201d hypothesis , what happens to people suffering from schizophrenic psychosis is that their brains lose the ability to forget or ignore as much as they normally would. Without such forgetting, they lose the ability to extract what\u2019s meaningful out of the immensity of stimulus that the brain encounters. They start making connections that aren\u2019t real, or drowning in a sea of so many connections that they lose the ability to stitch together any kind of coherent story at all. \u201cThe way I understand it,\u201d says Grasemann, \u201cis that, for instance, you eat lunch somewhere and you see 100 faces around you and suddenly they\u2019re all intensely meaningful, and your brain is telling you to make sense of that. You see a face somewhere and it looks like a co-worker, and you say to yourself, \u2018Wow you know that guy looks just like that other guy at work, so that guy at work must be following me.\u2019\u201d Image In order to model this process, Grasemann and Miikkulainen began by teaching a series of simple stories to DISCERN. The stories were assimilated into DISCERN\u2019s memory in much the way the human brain stores information\u2014not as distinct units, but as statistical relationships of words, sentences, scripts and stories. When asked to recall a specific memory, DISCERN doesn\u2019t retrieve it, like a person getting a book from the library stacks. Instead, it assembles it from the traces and signs and scripts left behind, basing its assembly on the statistical relationships that experience has encoded. \u201cWith neural networks, you basically train them by showing them examples, over and over and over again,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cEvery time you show it an example, you say, if this is the input, then this should be your output, and if this is the input, then that should be your output. You do it again and again thousands of times, and every time it adjusts a little bit more towards doing what you want. In the end, if you do it enough, the network has learned.\u201d DISCERN learned its stories well; it could recall them with almost 100 percent accuracy. In order to model hyperlearning, Grasemann and Miikkulainen ran the system through its paces again, but this time with one key parameter altered. They simulated an excessive release of dopamine by increasing the system\u2019s learning rate\u2014essentially telling it to stop forgetting so much. \u201cIt\u2019s an important mechanism to be able to ignore things,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cWhat we found is that if you crank up the learning rate in DISCERN high enough, it produces language abnormalities that suggest schizophrenia.\u201d After being re-trained with the elevated learning rate, DISCERN began putting itself at the center of fantastical, delusional stories that incorporated elements from other stories it had been told to recall (in one instance DISCERN claimed responsibility for a terrorist bombing). When the higher training rate was applied in a different way, DISCERN began showing evidence of \u201cderailment\u201d\u2014replying to requests for a specific memory with a jumble of dissociated sentences, abrupt digressions, and constant leaps from the first- to the third-person and back again. \u201cThe idea is that information processing in neural networks tends to be like information processing in the human brain in many ways,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cSo the hope was that it would also break down in similar ways. And it did.\u201d The parallel between their modified neural network and human schizophrenia isn\u2019t absolute proof, says Grasemann, that the hyperlearning hypothesis is correct. It is, however, support for the hypothesis, and also evidence of how useful neural networks can be in understanding the human brain. \u201cWe have so much more control over neural networks than we could ever have over human subjects,\u201d he says. \u201cThe hope is that this kind of modeling will help clinical research.\u201d Virtual Schizophrenia |Texas Science | By: Daniel Oppenheimer | Posted: Monday, May 4, 2009 News Categories Faculty Research Tags DISCERN dopamine hyperlearning Innovation Series neural network systems Risto Miikkulainen schizophrenia Uli Grasemann",

Image The foundation\u2019s investment is a challenge grant, to be paid as the College of Natural Sciences raises the remaining funds for the complex. The university has secured $30 million in commitments. The complex, which will consist of two buildings and a connecting atrium, will be named the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex in honor of the gift. The buildings will seed the transformation of one of the largest and most diverse top-10 computer science departments in the United States by enabling growth and innovation in the department\u2019s research and teaching programs. \u201cThis investment will advance the university\u2019s computer science program and help prepare future generations of innovative leaders,\u201d said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cWe believe it will also complement our foundation\u2019s wider goal, to increase the number of students who graduate from high school ready to succeed in college, and then the number of students who graduate from college.\u201d The Gates Foundation joins the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation in contributing to this building campaign. The complex\u2019s north building will be named Dell Computer Science Hall in honor of a $50 million gift the Dell Family Foundation made to the University of Texas System, of which $10 million will be used for the computer science complex. The Department of Computer Science has more than 900 undergraduate majors, 250 graduate students and 52 faculty members. It has a 17 percent Hispanic student enrollment. The complex will support growth of the department to at least 60 tenure-track faculty, a graduate program of about 350 and an undergraduate population of up to 1,500. The department is credited with $8.7 billion per year in strategic economic impact on the technology economy in Texas. It produces between 16 and 20 percent of all computer science graduates from top-tier departments nationally. Among the faculty are three members of the national academies, a Turing Award winner and the recipients of numerous other national and international awards. \u201cOur graduates are in high demand because computer science is the engine that drives much innovation and discovery in medicine, science, engineering, business, entertainment, transportation and national defense,\u201d said J Strother Moore, chair of the department. \u201cIt is basically impossible to be competitive today without computing expertise.\u201d World-class architectural firm Pelli Clark Pelli Architects is designing the 234,000-square-foot Gates Complex. It will be built in the heart of the campus on Speedway pedestrian mall in the space occupied by Taylor Hall and a soon to be decommissioned central chilling station. The Department of Computer Science is scattered among 6 buildings across campus. The new complex will bring the entire department together for the first time. It will feature state-of-the-art laboratory space, classrooms, faculty and graduate student offices, a 200-seat lecture hall and more than 24 discussion areas and seminar rooms. Large spaces and offices will support undergraduate student organizations, study lounges and project labs. \u201cThe Department of Computer Science is one of the best at the university, and its research and teaching missions are critical to the success of the university, the state and the nation,\u201d said William Powers Jr., president of the university. \u201cSupporting this department during this critical growth phase will greatly affect the future of our students and the world.\u201d Faculty and graduate students are working on pressing problems such as climate change, cancer and disease, genetics and DNA, safer and more fuel efficient cars, robotics, cybersecurity and national defense. These research programs will benefit from innovative \u201cresearch clusters\u201d throughout the building, where large collaborative laboratories are surrounded by multiple faculty, graduate student and visiting researcher offices. \u201cThe presence of the Gates Complex on The University of Texas at Austin campus will help us attract the best new faculty and students and allow us to merge teaching and research in an exciting new interdisciplinary environment,\u201d said Mary Ann Rankin, dean of the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cIt will help us to better fulfill our mission to enhance the economic and technological development of Texas and the nation.\u201d Contact Lee Clippard 512-232-0675 lclippard@mail.utexas.edu News Categories Press Release Tags Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Capital Campaign",

    "text_content": "Rethinking Encryption | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Rethinking Encryption Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, October 16, 2009 As information such as passwords and account numbers moves from computer to computer across the Internet, it is encrypted\u2014jumbled into a non-comprehensible form. Encryption occurs when two parties\u2014your personal computer and Amazon.com, for example\u2014connect and exchange a \u201ckey.\u201d Your browser then encrypts the information you want to send (like a credit card number), it flows in a jumble to Amazon, and then Amazon decrypts it based on the key that the two computers exchanged. You know your information is encrypted when you see the small lock icon on your Web browser or the \u201chttps\u201d appears in a Web address. Unfortunately, attackers can intercept this encrypted data as they flow through the system and use it maliciously. They can also access encrypted data from where it sits in storage, whether it\u2019s on a server you maintain or on one that lives elsewhere (for example, in a huge Google server-farm). The latter, dubbed \u201ccloud computing,\u201d is becoming more and more common and will require changes in the way that data are protected. \u201cMany of the assumptions of the past are changing rapidly in the face of new systems such as cloud computing,\u201d says Assistant Professor of Computer Science Brent Waters . Image Computing in the cloud means users are connecting to and storing information on servers outside of their immediate control. For example, people can rent server space from Amazon.com. Recently, the City of Los Angeles made headlines as it consider outsourcing server resources to the cloud (in that case, to Google.com). Facebook, too, is on the cloud. In the cloud, encrypted data sits on a server right next to space that others have access to. \u201cWhen I encrypt all the information on my hard drive and then my machine gets stolen, that\u2019s one kind of problem,\u201d says Waters. \u201cWith cloud storage, this information will be stored on third party servers, and encryption is going to be very important for that.\u201d Waters is working toward a new paradigm that he and Brent Waters, Assistant Professor for The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer ScienceAssistant Professor Brent Watershis collaborators call \u201cfunctional encryption.\u201d Image Traditional encryption involves knowing the identity of every individual that is allowed to see certain data. For example, Brent Waters may have access to items A and B, while Vitaly Shmatikov has access to B and C. Functional encryption, says Waters, will work by giving people with certain attributes\u2014not just their identity\u2014the ability to decrypt information. For example, city police share a lot of sensitive information about cases within their organization and with other law enforcement agencies. At present, people are given access to this information based on their identity, not necessarily the role they play in an investigation. Functional encryption could help the organization implement an overall policy (for example, \u2018only undercover detectives can see this information\u2019) and as the agents join a case (or leave it) they are automatically given access to certain privileged information. The key used to unlock the encrypted record would be based on multiple and dynamic criteria, rather than just a static name or ID number. \u201cWe need to re-envision what we really mean by encryption,\u201d says Waters. Waters also recently worked with Witchel on a project related to self-destructing data . There is no way to permanently delete any material posted or sent through the Internet, and this leaves people\u2019s information vulnerable to breaches in privacy. No paper shredder or lighted match exists to erase digital data out of history. But researchers from the University of Washington built a program, called \u201cVanish,\u201d that promised to make tagged computer data, such as emails and photographs, disappear after about eight hours. Waters, Witchel, graduate student Owen Hofmann and post-doc Christopher Rossbach, proved (unfortunately) that Vanish didn\u2019t work. They created a program called \u201cUnvanish\u201d that makes vanished data recoverable after they should have disappeared. \u201cOur goal with Unvanish is to discourage people from relying on the privacy of a system that is not actually private,\u201d says Witchel, assistant professor of computer science. Waters adds, \u201cMessages that self-destruct at a predetermined time would be very useful, especially where privacy is important, but a true self-destruction feature continues to be challenging to provide.\u201d From: In Computers We Trust? | TexasScience | By:Lee Clippard | Posted: Friday, October 16, 2009 Tags cloud computing cyber security encryption functional encryption Innovation Series self-destructing data Unvanish Vanish",

    "text_content": "Protecting Privacy | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Protecting Privacy Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, October 16, 2009 Image With so much information being shared online these days, it\u2019s critical that much of it remains private and anonymous. We trust, for example, that social networking sites such as Facebook remove personally identifiable information when they share our preferences and desires with advertisers. Vitaly Shmatikov , a young, fast-talking associate professor of computer science studies privacy in ubiquitous data sharing systems, from Facebook to hospitals to Netflix. \u201cWhen companies and organizations that have your data say they protect your privacy, what do they actually mean?\u201d Shmatikov asks. \u201cThey normally think they can share the data if they just anonymize it by removing the names and any identifying information, such as Social Security numbers and email addresses, and that there is no privacy issue.\u201d Shmatikov is finding that simply doing that doesn\u2019t quite do the trick. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve managed to show is that even if names are removed, any attackers with access to a little bit of public information can often reattach the names,\u201d he says. For example, he and graduate student Arvind Narayanan recently reported their ability to re-identify anonymized data produced by social networking sites Twitter and Flickr that they sell to advertisers. Image The scientists developed an algorithm that looked at the overlapping information among users of the different sites and analyzed the structure of the individuals\u2019 \u201cnetwork neighborhood.\u201d In one third of the cases, they identified people from what were completely anonymous data. \u201cIn practice, it\u2019s very easy to re-attach a name to anonymous data,\u201d says Shmatikov. He was also able to find the identities of Netflix users from anonymized data released by the company. \u201cFirst off, if you know just a few bits of information about some Netflix subscriber, just a few movies and whether they liked them or not, you can with very high confidence find that subscriber\u2019s record in the dataset,\u201d he says. Using some further mathematical reasoning, statistics and algorithms, Shmatikov re-attached names to the users by connecting their movie preferences and reviews with other breadcrumbs of information they left publicly on blogs and the IMDB (an online movie database). People might not use their real names on such sites, but they do often use their email address or list their city of residence. \u201cThen you can just Google search the email address, find their Amazon reviews with their real name, and you\u2019ve made the link,\u201d says Shmatikov. \u201cThat\u2019s not difficult.\u201d He says many people could abuse this lack of protection. Unscrupulous companies could use the information to spam people. Oppressive governments could use the information to monitor people. Cyberstalking\u2014from a mild version where helicopter parents monitor their kids to jilted exes stalking former partners\u2014could also be an issue. By breaking such systems apart, Shmatikov\u2019s research group is trying to show people that privacy protections should not be ad-hoc. Like Chang, he believes protections need to be built into the systems from the start. \u201cThe ultimate vision is that we\u2019re going to give you some software building blocks, and we\u2019re going to prove to you mathematically that if you build your program using these building blocks,\u201d he says, \u201cthen you will be safe against a certain class of privacy attacks.\u201d But he\u2019s quick to caution: \u201cThere are always other avenues of attack. We can\u2019t protect from everything with the software we would like to design.\u201d A relatively new arm of research for Shmatikov regards looking at genetic data. It\u2019s research he\u2019s embarking on with colleague Emmett Witchel . \u201cWe are well on our way to having all of our genomes sequenced very cheaply,\u201d Shmatikov says. \u201cMore and more medical and law enforcement databases are going to come with genetic data, and that information is extremely sensitive.\u201d In particular, doctors and researchers will be sharing this genetic information so they can search for better understandings of disease and develop new treatments. Data computations of this sort will be on a massive scale and will be extremely powerful in the world of health care. Witchel and Shmatikov are working to adapt a program called MapReduce, developed by Google for use on such large-scale computations, so that it provides privacy guarantees to people whose genetic data are being used but still keeps the process efficient and high performance. \u201cAs time goes on, we will see more databases with so-called anonymized genetic information being used for medical research,\u201d says Shmatikov. \u201cI think the next big privacy break is going to be in that area.\u201d They hope to develop tools and building blocks that can be used for these massive epidemiological and genome studies. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to tell them that they can run computations on sensitive data, but they can be assured that they won\u2019t learn anything about individual identities,\u201d he says. (The good guys don\u2019t need to know all those names either.) And again, with just a bit more information\u2014like a casual conversation about a person\u2019s ancestry or hair color\u2014cyber attackers could pretty easily re-attach a name to particular genetic sequences if they can get their hands on them. Shmatikov is reluctant to even predict what people might do maliciously with such data.

The 1910 Society Presents Conversations with Bob Taylor Co-sponsored by The Department of Computer Sciences Dell Distinguished Lecture Series Click for event details. Hosts : The University of Texas at Austin Graduate School , Department of Computer Sciences and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs When: Thursday, September 17, 2009 Where: LBJ Auditorium and AT&T Conference Center Parking: LBJ Library Parking lot and Manor Parking Garage Image Bob Taylor: Pioneer of the Digital Revolutio Image Texan and UT alum, Bob Taylor, is widely considered a pioneer in advancing the development of computing and the Internet. Taylor is one of the people who spearheaded the development of the Internet, the personal computer and the technologies that championed the computer revolution worldwide. He is known for his managerial insight and visionary genius as his contributions have had an outstanding impact on the world of computing and on society. This September is the 40th anniversary of the Internet. It all began when Bob Taylor, while working for the Department of Defense as a civilian manager in the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), became tired of alternating seats and instructions every time he needed to communicate with another computer. So, taking the bull by the horns, he proposed the idea of networking different computers together to his boss, who liked the idea on the spot and granted Taylor one million dollars to make the idea work. When idea turned into reality, ARPAnet was born. ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the world's first operational packet switching network and the predecessor of the global Internet. (1) \"The idea of a community that could be brought into existence by the construction of a new kind of computer system was perhaps the most radical proposal.\" (2) The effort began in 1966 and while ARPAnet was not on-line until 1969, enough of the superstructure for the outlines of the new network had been constructed at that point. The first message on ARPAnet went from Santa Monica to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) In 1969. (3) When all the details which they could only postulate about at that time, were perfected, the impact on both individuals and organizations was tremendous. (4) Taylor next set his sights on reaching beyond ARPAnet to develop what has become the Internet and the systems that support today\u2019s personal computers. In the 1970s, at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), he supervised the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), the renowned incubator where pivotal technologies for the personal computer and computer networking were born, and where businesses like Adobe, 3Com, and Novell were started. (5) Conceived at PARC, Alto, the prototype for the personal computer as we know it today and a direct ancestor of the Macintosh, had features that wouldn't be common until 10 years later, including a mouse, an object-oriented operating system and development tools, a graphical user interface, and fast networking with the first Ethernet cards. Some of these features are still standard 30 years later. Taylor\u2019s personal mission was to make the new computer technology available to the whole country. \u201cThe researchers at PARC were wildly successful in their efforts to build powerful personal computers years before the business and consumer communities were prepared to accept them.\u201d (6) In developing the personal computer Taylor\u2019s team had a grander purpose. Their goal in bringing all this computing power to individuals was to provide the \u201cgateway to a new communication space.\u201d (7) Bob Taylor\u2019s influence on society is far reaching. In addition to driving the invention of the Internet and the personal computer, he oversaw the development of electronic books, modern workstations and the forerunner to the Java programming language. Bob Taylor was recognized in 1999 with the award of the National Medal of Technology bestowed by the White House. The citation reads: \"For visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology, including initiating the ARPAnet project\u2014forerunner of today's Internet\u2014and advancing groundbreaking achievements in the development of the personal computer and computer networks.\" In 2004, the National Academy of Engineering awarded him, along with Butler W. Lampson, Charles P. Thacker and Alan Kay, their highest award, the Draper Prize. The citation reads: \"for the vision, conception, and development of the first practical networked personal computers.\" (8) You can also read more about this event at: http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/09/03/bob_taylor/ http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/09/12/0912taylor.html http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/news/story/889/ \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET 2 http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/10.html 3 http://wapedia.mobi/en/Robert_Taylor_%28computer_scientist%29 4 http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/10.html 5 http://wapedia.mobi/en/Robert_Taylor_%28computer_scientist%29 6 http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/10.html 7 http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/10.html 8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_%28computer_scientist%29 News Categories Events Tags Dell Distinguished Lecture Series Bob Taylor",

    "text_content": "Assembling the Tree of Life | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Assembling the Tree of Life Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, March 3, 2008 Assembling the Tree of Life | By Daniel Oppenheimer | March 3, 2008 In the beginning Ed Theriot\u2019s contributions to the Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) project\u2014\u201cthe story of life on Earth, in a nutshell\u201d\u2014often begin pretty humbly. \u201cSometimes we go down to Waller Creek, right on campus, with a turkey baster and a toothbrush, and we suck up algae from the water and scrub it off the rocks,\u201d says Theriot, the director of the Texas Natural Science Center and a biology professor at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cWe recently found what looks to be a new species of diatom that way.\u201d Image Theriot has also procured diatoms\u2014a type of silica-shelled algae that\u2019s responsible for producing nearly 25 percent of the world\u2019s oxygen\u2014from the deck of his boat, dredging a net through the saltwaters off the coast of Texas. He\u2019s gotten them in the mail from collaborators in Maine and Guam, and from down the hall from his laboratory, out of the UTEX Culture Collection of Algae. From there, the process gets fancier. In the lab, individual diatom cells are plucked one by one from the water sample and placed into tubes of liquid culture media, where they grow by cell division into millions of copies of the original cell. From this batch of cells, the DNA is chemically extracted and individual genes are sequenced. Genetic sequences from similar species are aligned and translated into a form that computers can interpret. These sequences are then run through statistical algorithms that consider millions, billions and even trillions of possible evolutionary (\u201cphylogenetic\u201d) relationships between the species before selecting the one that best explains the similarities among all of the sequences. The trees are further refined by looking at the morphology of the species\u2014what they look like\u2014along with all the other sources of non-molecular information that illuminate what they eat, how they store energy, how they reproduce and how long they\u2019ve been on the planet. At the end of it all, if a biologist like Theriot is lucky, there\u2019s a useful and pretty accurate representation of when, over the last few hundred million years, hundreds or thousands of species of diatoms diverged from each other and went their separate evolutionary ways. All this is only a small part of the multi-institutional, interdisciplinary, multi-million dollar effort\u2014funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF)\u2014to assemble the tree of life. The project will, by the time it\u2019s completed, call on the energies, talents and patience of thousands of biologists, mathematicians, geologists, computer scientists and technicians working together across generations, continents, ecosystems, species, academic cultures and computer languages. Tens of millions of organisms will be collected, sequenced, described and virtually represented. New algorithms will be developed to sift through and extract, in minutes, the kinds of meaningful analyses and comparisons of DNA sequences that would once have taken even the world\u2019s fastest computers months, years or millennia to produce. New software will be coded. New information databases will be painstakingly constructed and integrated with each other. Many of the applications that will flow from this project, in which scientists at The University of Texas at Austin are playing a central role, will seem like science fiction. Image Within a decade, scientists could have a crude version of the \u201ctricorder\u201d that characters Spock and Bones use on Star Trek\u2014a handheld device that can take a sample from an unknown species, rapidly sequence its DNA, connect remotely to a database of known species and make highly accurate predictions about its nature, habitat, mating patterns and ecological niche. Within a few decades, patients should be able to walk into their doctors\u2019 offices with a common cold and walk out with a treatment that\u2019s been cooked up, on the spot, to combat the particular strain of cold that\u2019s afflicting them. Within a hundred years, biologists may be able to play with the design of life as easily as Apple plays with the design of its laptops. More simply, the AToL project will realize a founding dream of modern biology. It\u2019s the \u201ctree of life\u201d that Charles Darwin envisioned when he published \u201cThe Origin of Species\u201d in 1859\u2014a nearly comprehensive family tree showing how a single organism evolved into the tens of millions of distinct species that now populate the Earth. \u201cThe tree of life is sort of the holy grail for all of biology,\u201d says Theriot, \u201cand it has ramifications for almost everything, from medicine to ecology to agriculture.\u201d In the field Along with Theriot, seminal work on assembling the tree of life is being done at the university by biologists Robert Jansen, David Hillis, Randy Linder and David Cannatella, computer scientists Tandy Warnow, Warren Hunt and Daniel Miranker, geologists Tim Rowe and Julian Humphries, and dozens of graduate and postdoctoral students working with these faculty. It\u2019s a project, says Jansen, that was barely conceivable a generation ago. \u201cIt was at about the time that I got my Ph.D., in 1982, that people were beginning to seriously consider new approaches to phylogenetics,\u201d says Jansen, who was principal investigator on the AToL project that just published a tree relating all the major groups of flowering plants . \u201cPrior to that, we would just draw a tree and say, \u2018This is how these species are related,\u2019 and not really provide evidence.\u201d Jansen, who\u2019s also working with Theriot on the algae project, created his first phylogenetic tree 25 years ago for his doctoral thesis. He assembled that tree, which dealt with a few dozen species of sunflower-like plants common in Mexico, based entirely on a visual examination of the morphology of the different species of plants. He extracted no DNA, did no multiple sequence alignment and used no sophisticated algorithmic software. For his recent flowering plant project, Jansen and his colleagues sequenced the entire genomes of the chloroplasts (the photosynthetic hearts of plant cells) of 64 species of plants. The genetic information they amassed was so great, running to millions of nucleotides (the molecules that make the code in DNA), that they had to create new software to align it. Since then, says Jansen, even better sequencing techniques have been developed. \u201cYou can now get 100,000,000 nucleotides in four hours,\u201d he says. Image The huge leap forward, from the do-it-yourself tree Jansen made for his thesis to the publication of his team\u2019s genetically based, exquisitely accurate history of flowering plants, has come about in large part because of a number of complementary advances in technology. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t feasible until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when several things came together,\u201d says biologist Hillis. \u201cWe developed the ability to rapidly collect molecular data\u2014to rapidly sequence genes. The computer revolution allowed us to deal with such a massive volume of information. And we developed the analytical methods to put those two things together.\u201d Hillis and biologist Cannatella are on the steering committee of the \u201cAmphibiaTree\u201d group, which has done groundbreaking work clarifying the phylogeny of modern frogs and salamanders. They\u2019re doing the kind of heavy biological lifting that will, over the next few generations, make it possible for us to fill out most of the picture of extant life\u2014taking us from the roughly 1.7 million species now identified to the estimated 10-100 million species that co-exist with us on the planet. \u201cMost of the species on the planet aren\u2019t even known yet,\u201d says Hillis, \u201cand without the tree of life, there\u2019s not a simple way to take information about a new organism that someone discovers and put it in a context of all the rest of life.\u201d In the late 1990s, Hillis helped convene one of the three workshops that led directly to the NSF\u2019s funding of the AToL project, and since then he\u2019s stayed involved in spreading the word about the tree of life. He oversees a grant to train graduate students in computational phylogeny, and he\u2019s created, with his colleagues Robin Gutell and Derrick Zwickl, what\u2019s perhaps the most pedagogically useful\u2014and almost certainly the coolest-looking\u2014picture of a branch on the tree of life [PDF]. Much of the research Hillis, Jansen, Theriot and their colleagues are doing isn\u2019t so different, at the laboratory level, from what they were doing before the first AToL grants were awarded in 2001. The large-scale organization that the project is facilitating, however, has sped up the process, and brought into focus how valuable the collaboration across disciplines can be. In the matrix For Warnow and Linder, a computer scientist and a biologist, respectively, the synthesis of insights from the different disciplines guides them as they deal with what is perhaps the greatest analytical challenge of the AToL project\u2014the near-infinitude of the possible evolutionary trees. Image \u201cThese are not problems that are solvable in a meaningful sense,\u201d says Linder. \u201cWhen you\u2019re comparing molecular data on, say, 100 species, the number of possible trees is greater than the number of fundamental particles in the universe. If it could even be solved, it would take our fastest computers millennia, or more, to do it.\u201d So rather than solve these problems in any final way, Warnow and Linder and other scientists working on this aspect of the problem are forced to generate new and better ways to estimate the best possible evolutionary tree (or trees) for a given group of species. Refining their estimations entails, among other things, writing statistical algorithms that hop through the total realm of all possible evolutionary trees\u2014\u201ctreespace,\u201d as they call it\u2014in a balanced way. The journey must be random enough to benefit from the great diversity of potential trees but still directed enough to recognize that if a given tree seems pretty promising, it\u2019s worth generating similar trees to see if they\u2019re even better. Biology-based models are also important in estimating a good tree. For example, the tree must make sense with what we know about the fossil record and the geographical dispersal of the different species, and it must fit with what the most sophisticated models of evolution tell us about which kinds of mutations occur more frequently than other kinds of mutations. At the same time, Warnow and Linder\u2019s software takes into account that even the basic molecular data sets that are being analyzed by the algorithms\u2014the similar strings of nucleotides from similar species\u2014can generate radically different trees depending on how they\u2019re fed into the algorithms in relation to each other. To deal with this \u201cmultiple sequence alignment\u201d problem, Warnow and Linder generate likely histories of how and when comparable genetic sequences (as opposed to species) mutated away from each other. By adding this uncertainty to the basic uncertainty of the tree estimate process, the computational problem becomes even greater. But it\u2019s worth it, says Warnow, because the results are potentially so much more accurate. Image \u201cTo do these things well you have to think about it not purely as a software person, not purely as a mathematician, not purely as a biologist, not purely statistically, not purely as a data person,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the interplay and feedback among them that\u2019s really interesting.\u201d In the archives Warnow and Linder\u2019s generation of potential phylogenetic trees creates the opportunity for computer scientist Hunt\u2019s involvement with AToL. Hunt and one of his graduate students, Serita Nelesen, have found a vastly more efficient way to store and analyze the terabytes of information the phylogenetic analyses produce. They recognize that in a typical analysis, the many possible evolutionary trees share large pieces of structure, only differing in some of the details. \u201cInstead of reproducing each part of every tree when you store it, which is what\u2019s been done up to this point,\u201d says Nelesen, \u201cwe have a way to replace the redundant parts with a kind of digital pointer that says, \u2018This is exactly like that section of tree over there.\u2019 It saves an amazing amount of space.\u201d That this problem hasn\u2019t been solved before, says Hunt, is a function of the fact that the size of the groups of species being analyzed has, until recently, been pretty small. There just hasn\u2019t been as much data to analyze. Also, the code has been written mostly by biologists who don\u2019t necessarily have the luxury, or the professional inclination, to peer into the future of data storage and analysis, when the scale will involve assimilating millions of species into a single tree. \u201cAs computer scientists,\u201d says Hunt, \u201cwe can do it in a way that\u2019s more industrial grade going in. We can design algorithms with scaling in mind.\u201d In the mix For Miranker, who\u2019s creating database software to store two- and three-dimensional images of organisms, the question is less about compressing data than it is about organizing it. Miranker\u2019s software includes features that are common in commercial applications but rarely available in scientific software. Whenever users sit down to enter the (very long Latin) taxonomic names of their samples, for example, the system suggests autocompletions, thus reminding the scientists of the community\u2019s preferred names and reducing the incidence of typos. The benefit, says Miranker, is greater convenience for the scientists and greater precision for the database. More significantly, from a phylo-informatic perspective, the software enables better search results. By making the process easier, biologists will upload more images and annotate their images more consistently and thoroughly. The database should then grow richer and more accurate as time goes on, and the various searches for a particular species\u2014or bone, or cellular structure\u2014more productive. By designing software that imposes certain standards on its users, Miranker has had to wrestle with the future of biology and with how much is at stake in decisions\u2014like what name to assign to a particular species\u2014that may seem uncontroversial to an outsider. Image \u201cThere are some very interesting computer science research problems that will come out of this,\u201d says Miranker, \u201cbut this is not really computer science research. The main thing I\u2019m doing is what, in business school, they call product market management. The challenge has been social. \u201cI\u2019m collecting from the biological community what they think their requirements are, and I\u2019m trying to create a piece of software that helps them do their job right in as painless a way as possible.\u201d In the mind\u2019s eye Geologist Rowe\u2019s work with the Digital Morphology library ( DigiMorph.org )\u2014a digital archive of 2-D and 3-D images of both living and extinct species\u2014is a reminder that when assembling the tree of life, scientists are still working with whole organic species, rather than just strings of genetic data. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense out there that with all the new molecular methods, morphology is fading, but really it\u2019s undergoing a renaissance,\u201d says Rowe, the project director of DigiMorph and one of the managers of the university\u2019s high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scanner, which has done many of the scans that now reside at DigiMorph.org. It\u2019s not just that the large skeletal canal revealed by a deep scan of a 120-million-year-old proto-platypus fossil can resolve a phylogenetic controversy. It can, as Rowe discovered recently. His scan of a Teinolophos fossil revealed that the platypus and its closest extant relative, the echidna, diverged tens of millions of years earlier than was previously thought. It\u2019s also true that the hard morphological facts documented by scans can undermine, as Rowe\u2019s platypus-scan did, entire sets of assumptions about the nature of mammalian evolution. \u201cIt underscores the importance of fossils in testing the assumptions we make when speculating from molecular data,\u201d says Rowe. The images, and the ways that Rowe and his colleagues are engineering them, can also be powerful tools for organizing information. Images can be annotated. They can be supplemented with other kinds of information about the species. They can link to other Web sites. And they can even, in one of the cooler applications that DigiMorph offers, be manufactured into actual, physical objects made of plastic that can be handled and studied as if they were the original specimens. In the end Image The long-term goal of the Assembling the Tree of Life project, says Hillis, is that an ever-more accurate and comprehensive evolutionary tree will make it possible for biology to become predictive in the way sciences like chemistry and physics already are. \u201cIndividual genes, organisms, populations, species\u2014they\u2019re not interchangeable in the way that in chemistry, for instance, a hydrogen atom is always a hydrogen atom,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to make biology predictive, we have to understand the history and the relationships.\u201d The goal is also, of course, to complete the tree, or come as close to finishing it as possible. (Because new species are always evolving, scientists can only hope to get close to completing the tree.) And it\u2019s to provide a fundamental knowledge base\u2014a kind of periodic table of the elements for biology\u2014with which to revolutionize applications in medicine, agriculture, ecology and other fields whose connection to biology hasn\u2019t yet become clear. The purpose is also, perhaps, a little bit spiritual\u2014to commune in the presence of the mystery of life. \u201cThe part of the labwork I love the most,\u201d says Theriot, \u201cis actually looking at the diatoms through a scanning electron microscope. The shells are incredibly beautiful and ornate. Every time I do this, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m seeing something that no one\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d News Categories Research Tags Algorithmic Computational Biology",

Download the free QuickTime player AUSTIN, Texas - November 6, 2007 The UT Department of Computer Sciences held the annual Visions Lecture, the latest in a series of lectures by CS faculty who have been recognized by their community for notable achievements in research, teaching or service. This year's Visions Lecture took place on November 5, 2007, from 4:30-5:30 p.m. in the Avaya Auditorium, ACES 2.302. Dr. Peter Stone, Winner of the IJCAI 2007 Computers and Thought award Image \"Learning and Multiagent Reasoning for Autonomous Agents\" Talk Abstract: One goal of Artificial Intelligence is to enable the creation of robust, fully autonomous agents that can coexist with us in the real world. Such agents will need to be able to learn, both in order to correct and circumvent their inevitable imperfections, and to keep up with a dynamically changing world. They will also need to be able to interact with one another, whether they share common goals, they pursue independent goals, or their goals are in direct conflict. This talk presented current research directions in machine learning, multiagent reasoning, and robotics, and advocated their unification within concrete application domains. Ideally, new theoretical results in each separate area will inform practical implementations while innovations from concrete multiagent applications will drive new theoretical pursuits, and together these synergistic research approaches will lead us towards the goal of fully autonomous agents.

Clarke, E. Allen Emerson , and Joseph Sifakis the winners of the 2007 A.M. Turing Award, widely considered the most prestigious award in computing, for their original and continuing research in a quality assurance process known as Model Checking. Their innovations transformed this approach from a theoretical technique to a highly effective verification technology that enables computer hardware and software engineers to find errors efficiently in complex system designs. This transformation has resulted in increased assurance that the systems perform as intended by the designers. The Turing Award, named for British mathematician Alan M. Turing, carries a $250,000 prize, with financial support provided by Intel Corporation and Google Inc. Clarke of Carnegie Mellon University, and Emerson of the University of Texas at Austin, working together, and Sifakis, working independently for the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at the University of Grenoble in France, developed this fully automated approach that is now the most widely used verification method in the hardware and software industries. ACM President Stuart Feldman said the work of Clarke, Emerson and Sifakis has had a major impact on designers and manufacturers of semiconductor chips. \u201cThese industries face a technology explosion in which products of unprecedented complexity have to operate as expected for companies to survive. This verification advance enabled these industries to shorten time to market and increase product integrity. Without the conceptual breakthrough pioneered by these researchers, we might still be stuck with chips that have many errors and would lack the power and speed of today\u2019s equipment. This is a great example of an industry-transforming technology arising from highly theoretical research,\u201d Feldman said. Model Checking as a standard procedure for quality assurance has enabled designers and manufacturers to address verification problems that span both hardware and software. It has also helped them to gain mathematical confidence that complex computer systems meet their specifications, and it has provided added security for a range of both common and critical computing applications. \u201cIntel and the entire computing industry have been direct beneficiaries of the awardees\u2019 ground-breaking work,\u201d said Andrew Chien, Vice President in the Corporate Technology Group and Director of Research of Intel Corporation. \u201cOur researchers and engineers have worked closely with Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis for 15 years. Insights from their novel automatic verification results have been widely adopted by the entire industry. These Model Checking approaches provide dramatically better coverage when searching for design errors.\u201d \"Google, like any contemporary technology company, owes a great deal of its success to the work of pioneering researchers who have come before,\" said Alan Eustace, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Google. \"We are proud to honor the award winners for their innovative solution to a difficult and pervasive issue and we hope this will encourage and inspire those who now face the technology challenges of the future.\" Migrating From Pure Research to Industrial Reality Logical errors in digital circuit designs, software, and communication protocols are an important problem for system designers. They often result in delays in getting new products to market, failures of critical systems already in use, and expensive replacement of faulty hardware and patching of flawed software. Model Checking started as an academic research idea. The continuing research of Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis as well as others in the international research community over the last 27 years led to the creation of new logics, as well as new algorithms and surprising theoretical results. This in turn has stimulated the creation of many Model Checking tools by both academic and industrial teams, resulting in the widespread industrial use of Model Checking. Many major hardware and software companies now rely heavily on Model Checking. Common examples include verification of the designs for integrated circuits such as microprocessors, as well as communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms. Among the beneficiaries of Model Checking are personal computer users, medical device makers, and nuclear power plant operators. As computerized systems pervade daily life, consumers rely on digital controllers to supervise critical functions of cars, airplanes, and industrial plants. Digital switching technology has replaced analog components in the telecommunications industry, and security protocols enable e-commerce applications and privacy. Wherever significant investments or human lives are at risk, quality assurance for the underlying hardware and software components becomes paramount. Background In 1981, Edmund Clarke and Allen Emerson working in the U.S., and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France with J.P. Queille, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of Model Checking. This verification technology offers two advantages. It provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model, such as a hardware or software design, satisfies a formal specification, such as a temporal logic formula (i.e. a pattern for a sequence of events). In addition, it identifies the counter-examples that show the source of the problem, which must be addressed should the stated property specification not hold. A drawback of the Model Checking approach, known as the state-explosion problem, seemed to limit its applicability to small designs of mainly academic interest. Randal Bryant, Edmund Clarke, Allen Emerson and Kenneth McMillan invented Symbolic Model Checking, which greatly extended the size and complexity of systems that could be verified. It also led to the widespread adoption of Model Checking by the computer hardware industry. For this invention, Bryant, Clarke, Emerson, and McMillan received the 1998 Paris Kanellakis Award for Theory and Practice from ACM. In 1999, they also received the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence from Carnegie Mellon University. Sifakis, together with Thomas A. Henzinger and Sergio Yovine, extended the Model Checking approach to address verification of real time systems. In 2001, Sifakis received the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Silver Medal. Edmund M.

    "text_content": "2011 Visions of Computing Lecture | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content 2011 Visions of Computing Lecture Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, October 13, 2011 On Wednesday, October 26, 2011, the University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science will hold the annual Visions of Computing Lecture, a lecture series honoring UTCS faculty accomplishments. Through this lecture series, faculty present insights into computer science research and education to the public and the computing community. This year's lecture will take place from 4:00 - 5:30 p.m. in the Avaya Auditorium, ACES 2.302. Raymond Mooney - \"Learning Natural Language from its Perceptual Context\" Image Machine learning has become the best approach to building systems that comprehend human language. However, current systems require a great deal of laboriously constructed human-annotated training data. Ideally, a computer would be able to acquire language like a child by being exposed to linguistic input in the context of a relevant but ambiguous perceptual environment.  As a step in this direction, we have developed systems that learn to sportscast simulated robot soccer games and to follow navigation instructions in virtual environments by simply observing sample human linguistic behavior.  This work builds on our earlier work on supervised learning of semantic parsers that map natural language into a formal meaning representation.  In order to apply such methods to learning from observation, we have developed methods that estimate the meaning of sentences from just their ambiguous perceptual context. About Raymond Mooney Awarded Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery Raymond J. Mooney is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. He is an author of over 150 published research papers, primarily in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing. He was the President of the International Machine Learning Society from 2008-2011, was program co-chair for the 2006 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, general chair of the 2005 Human Language Technology Conference and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, and co-chair of the 1990 International Conference on Machine Learning.

His recent research has focused on learning for natural-language processing, connecting language and perception, statistical relational learning, and transfer learning. William Press - \"Visions of a National Learning Health Care System\" Image As health information becomes increasingly electronic, many improvements in health care delivery, and in the science underlying medical advances, become possible.  This talk will review some of these and highlight where they suggest important research agendas in computer science. About William Press Named Vice Chair of PCAST and President Elect of AAAS William H. Press is the Warren J. and Viola M. Raymer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin.  Previously, he was Deputy Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Press is a current member of President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.  He is also President-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Tandy Warnow - \"Recent breakthroughs in mathematical and computational phylogenetics\" Image Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary history of a set of species (or genes), and are important for much biological research. Almost all of the methods used to construct phylogenetic trees are computationally very intensive (typically being based upon attempts to solve NP-hard optimization problems),  most make unrealistic assumptions about the evolutionary process, and few have been tested under realistic conditions.  In this talk I will describe recent breakthroughs in phylogenetic analysis, including mathematical results regarding estimation under stochastic models of evolution, and novel algorithmic approaches that provide higher accuracy on biological and simulated datasets. About Tandy Warnow Awarded Guggenheim Fellowship Tandy Warnow is the David Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor in Computer Sciences at UT-Austin.

In 1985 Chris Brown and he led a team that designed and built a high speed binocular camera control system capable of simulating human eye movements. The system was mounted on a robotic arm that allowed it to move at one meter per second in a two meter radius workspace. This system has led to an increased understanding of the role of behavior in vision. The theoretical aspects of that system were summarized in \"Animate Vision,'' which received the Best Paper Award at the 1989 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Currently he is interested in pursuing this research by using model humans in virtual reality environments. Under an NCRR funded grant with Mary Hayhoe, he installed the first eye-tracker in a head-mounted display. In addition he is working on models of the brain that relate to detailed neural codes. He is the author of the text \"Natural Computation\" and co-author with Chris Brown of \"Computer Vision.\" Kristen Grauman, Assistant Professor Image Kristen Grauman will be joining the department in January, 2007.

Nationally, women represent approximately 60% of college graduates, but representation in Computer Science has fallen to approximately 15%. To address the need for gender equity, UTCS gained funding from the Texas Engineering and Technical Consortium (TETC) to develop the First Bytes program. The program is aimed at identifying and overcoming attitudinal barriers so that computing science becomes a viable career option in the minds of young women. At the First Bytes Residential Summer Program, approximately 50 high school women from across Texas live on The University of Texas campus with adult female advisors who guide, inspire and empower them during the last week of June. Activities designed to overcome barriers to women in computing include career mentoring, programming language labs, logic games, computer dissection, robotic competitions, tours of local technology companies and visits with Computer Sciences faculty. Educational reforms, starting with awareness, can work as proven by the dramatic difference at Carnegie Mellon where the percentage of women entering the School of Computer Science rose from 7% in 1995 to 42% in 2000.\u00b9 The First Bytes program challenges traditional stereotypes about computing careers by getting to the heart of hidden questions such as: Will I like computing as a job? Is work/life balance possible? Will I feel isolated or will I be supported and included? Is it too hard for me? Will I be seen as a \"geek?\" Will I feel out of place as an underrepresented gender? Is there a social impact to computing where I can help others and make a difference? What kinds of other science related problems can I help solve? \"As a camper at First Bytes, I absolutely fell in love with the University of Texas at Austin and could not wait to begin my education here. Now as an adviser, I share my enthusiasm for Computer Science and UT with other bright young girls,\" said Jennifer McClelen, former camper and advisor at First Bytes.\" Corporations concerned about gender equity and diversity hiring support the program with sponsor funding, gifts and participation in Corporate Chat, a luncheon where women in technology occupations inspire First Bytes participants with their personal life and career stories. Corporate sponsors this year include Lockheed Martin , Cisco Systems , Amazon.com and Schlumberger .

Honorees and speakers were Dr. Alan Cline, who has been accepted into the Academy of Distinguished Teachers at UT Austin and Dr. Simon Lam, winner of the 2004 Software System Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This year's Visions Lectures took place on October 6, 2005, from 5-6 p.m. in the ACES Avaya Auditorium, ACES 2.302. Speaking to a packed lecture hall, both speakers enjoyed the rapt attention of faculty, staff, students and invited guests. Below is an abstract of each talk. Speaker: Professor Alan Cline Title: \u201cThe Disregard of Science and the Responsibility of Scientists\u201d Image Abstract: In various ways, science is under attack. Political leaders ignore science or reject its conclusions. Funding agencies reduce money for university-based scientific research. News media either ignore science or attempt to give equal weight to science and anti-science. Religious leaders fight science and castigate scientists. Elementary school teachers present science as simply sets of facts to be memorized. Regular citizens have little understanding of what science is, how the scientific method works, or what value it has for them. Meanwhile the reaction of scientists is a perplexed befuddlement coupled with a hope for better times. I will present evidence of the misunderstanding and rejection of science from many quarters. I find that the scientific community itself bears a significant portion of the blame. I will discuss steps to be taken toward the reversal of the trend \u2013 notions that require more than simply hope. Image Speaker: Professor Simon Lam Title: \u201cOpening and Closing Problems in Security Protocols Research\u201d Abstract: The problem of authentication protocols for computer networks was opened by Needham and Schroeder in a 1978 paper. It was motivated by the ARPANET and by the invention of public key cryptography two years earlier. In the \"tree\" of security research, Needham and Schroeder initiated what turned out to be a very large subtree. This subtree has two major branches, one on the verification of security protocols and the other on the design and implementation of authentication services for computer networks. In this talk, I review some of our past and current efforts on network security research and place them within the subtree of security protocols research for computer networks.

Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, November 30, 2004 AUSTIN, Texas -- The Center for Information Assurance and Security (CIAS) has been founded at The University of Texas at Austin to address the nation's growing cybersecurity problems. Image Primary center objectives are conducting research that will lead to innovative cybersecurity solutions and addressing the national need to produce more trained professionals in the field. Recent surveys highlight alarming statistics about Internet and data security. For example, 43 percent of 500 organizations reported an increase in electronic crime in 2003. Each was victimized an average of 136 times, despite the majority using firewalls and physical security systems. Another recent survey found that nearly one in five companies was a target of cyber-extortion, including threats of theft of customer data and destruction or theft of intellectual property by cybercriminals. And a 2001 survey found that one in 20 U.S. adults were victims of online fraud, and one in 50 were victims of identity theft. \"Despite considerable industry spending to develop solutions, the cybersecurity problem continues to grow at an alarming rate,\" said Dr. Frederick R. Chang, director of the CIAS and research professor. \"These solutions have made us somewhat safer, but certainly not safe.\" Chang, who chairs the board of the Austin Technology Council, recently moved from his position as president of technology strategy for SBC Communications to the university's Department of Computer Sciences to lead the center's efforts. While with SBC, Chang developed a security lab that investigated how to protect large-scale Internet networks. He is a member of the National Security Agency (NSA) Technology Panel and serves on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board Committee on Telecommunications Research and Development for the National Academy of Sciences. The center will operate as a multi-disciplinary initiative involving business, government and academia. The university's CIAS team will include faculty, researchers and students from the Department of Computer Sciences, College of Engineering, McCombs School of Business and the Applied Research Laboratories. \"The new Center for Information Assurance and Security has been established as a multi-disciplinary entity, which will allow it to draw broadly on the many world-class researchers and educators who are working in the area,\" said Ret. Admiral Bobby R. Inman, former director of the NSA and current holder of the Lyndon B. Johnson Centennial Chair in National Policy at the university. \"I believe that the new center is exceptionally well-positioned to make a significant national contribution to the growing cybersecurity problem.\" Future CIAS plans include work toward becoming a National Academic Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education, participating in a multi-university cybersecurity exercise and competition, and increasing collaborations with business, government and academia. NOTE: Inman will become interim dean of the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in January 2005.

It will affect how we work, spend our leisure time, make policy decisions and make sense of the world around us. And yet, most of us don\u2019t really understand how the technologies work or what their potential risks and benefits are. UT Austin\u2019s Department of Computer Science , in partnership with the university\u2019s Good Systems program, is launching a new course this fall titled The Essentials of AI for Life and Society . Beginning the week of August 21, the one semester-credit-hour course will provide basic AI literacy and cover the ethical and societal implications of AI technologies. It\u2019s open to all students at UT Austin, regardless of major, as well as staff and faculty. No prerequisites, technical knowledge or programming skills are required. Peter Stone \u2014 professor of computer science, director of Texas Robotics, founding member of Good Systems, and one of the course\u2019s co-instructors \u2014 thinks every part of the economy will be touched in some way by AI. \u201cTo succeed in the coming world, it\u2019s going to be essential to be familiar with AI tools and be able to strategize about what\u2019s going to be the role of human creativity and human labor and human value in the economy, compared to AI tools,\u201d he said. Students can register at the Office of the Registrar to take the course (CS 109) for credit. Staff, faculty and graduate students can sign up here , preferably by September 5th, to audit the course without credit. The course will be taught by three core computer science faculty \u2014 Joydeep Biswas, Don Fussell and Stone \u2014 as well as several guest lecturers from other areas of the university that intersect with AI technology, including the Moody College of Communication, the School of Information, the LBJ School of Public Affairs, the Steve Hicks School of Social Work and the Cockrell School of Engineering. \u201cThere has been a real tipping point in terms of the power of AI and in particular its accessibility to a huge array of applications,\u201d said David Vanden Bout, dean of the College of Natural Sciences, who initiated the first discussions around the new course. \u201cGiving UT students both a broad perspective on AI as well as the ethical considerations of its application will equip our students with key knowledge of a technology that is likely to become pervasive in our lives.\u201d The first part of the course is an introduction to what AI and machine learning are, including the major methodologies and paradigms, as well as a few application areas like computer vision, natural language processing, reasoning under uncertainty and robotics. The second part will focus on societal implications, such as impacts on the workforce, proliferation of misinformation and disinformation, challenges to democracy and benefits. \u201cEvery UT student is going to touch artificial intelligence in some way, shape or form,\u201d said Sharon Strover, professor in the School of Journalism and Media, Good Systems\u2019 chair and a key organizer of the course. \u201cWe want to catch them early, so that we can help shape the agenda that they carry around with them with respect to what AI technologies are, what some of the do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s are, and what they want their relationship with technology to be as they encounter AI.\u201d Good Systems is one of UT Austin\u2019s interdisciplinary research Grand Challenges housed in the Office of the Vice President for Research, Scholarship and Creative Endeavors. Its focus is on how to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence for the good of all of society, while mitigating potential harms and unintended consequences. The course, which runs the entire fall semester, has a hybrid format. It will meet every Wednesday from 4 to 5 p.m. for a live, synchronous lecture that can be attended in-person at the LAITS studio classroom or streaming online. Each week, there will be an assigned reading, an interactive lecture and short assessments. Students have the option to take the course for a letter grade or pass/fail. For additional information and to test your computer and internet connectivity, go to LAITS Online Courses for Students . \u201cMy number one hope is that participants get the ability to discern what\u2019s realistic and what\u2019s science fiction, to be able to understand the terminology that\u2019s being used in the news, to be able to apply the lessons to real decisions that they need to make in their own careers and to be engaged and inform the public debate about how our society should respond to these new technologies,\u201d Stone said.

Lam , professor and Regents Chair in Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, has received the Association of Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM) Award for lifetime contribution to the field of communications networks. \"The SIGCOMM Award is widely recognized as the highest honor in computer networking,\" said Professor Mark Crovella of Boston University, the SIGCOMM Award Committee chair. Lam addressed more than 500 Internet researchers from around the world on Aug. 31 at the annual SIGCOMM conference in the conference's keynote speech. In his address, Lam urged the Internet research community to direct its efforts toward a major improvement in the Internet protocol (IP). \"Ten years ago, when Internet applications were primarily email, ftp and Web, IP's simplicity was its greatest strength in fighting off competitors and winning the networking race for data communications,\" Lam said. \"In the future, however, IP's simplicity is possibly a liability because the requirements of Internet's future applications will be more demanding, particularly the requirements of interactive multimedia applications.\" Lam explained that the underlying model of IP is a network of queues that is prone to a phenomenon known as congestion collapse. He urged the Internet research community to take advantage of the current window of opportunity, while the Internet core has a lot more bandwidth than traffic, to do research that will strengthen IP's foundation for the future. \"Why should we be concerned with IP's foundation?\" Lam asked. \"I believe that IP is on track to become the universal interface for telecommunications. Like the previous technology transformation from analog to digital transport, we are in the midst of a technology transformation from digital to packet transport. There is no alternative to IP to serve as this universal packet interface. The migration of voice traffic from telephone networks to IP networks has already begun. The next step is the migration of television services. \"For IP to eventually become the universal interface for telecommunications, the IP layer itself will need to evolve to provide services that attend to the needs of its new constituents, namely, voice and video traffic,\" he said. \"When packet switching was first proposed in the 1960s, it was justified with the observation that data traffic is bursty, with a very high peak-to-average ratio, unlike voice traffic. But if the network traffic mix changes, with the addition of large amounts of voice and video traffic, we should be open minded about adopting a multi-service approach for IP.\" Lam concluded his speech by proposing the design of a flow-oriented service targeting high-quality telephony and television traffic and suggested that it should be added to IP. In the early 1970s, as a graduate student in the ARPANET Measurement Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, Lam contributed to a project on packet switching techniques for satellite and radio networks. This project was the beginning of a line of research that eventually led to today's Wi-Fi networks. In 1993, Lam led a group of researchers from The University of Texas at Austin that invented secure sockets and prototyped the first secure sockets layer, named Secure Network Programming.

    "text_content": "A More Efficient Future For Neural Network Systems | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content A More Efficient Future For Neural Network Systems Posted by Trinity Erales on Friday, April 21, 2023 UT Computer Science Ph.D. Garrett Bingham \u2019s research under Professor Risto Miikkulainen in smart automated machine learning has made significant steps toward more efficient neural network systems. In a paper called \u201c AutoInit: Analytic Signal-Preserving Weight Initialization for Neural Networks \u201d, Bingham presents AutoInit , a tailored solution toward automatic weight initialization for neural networks. Since the 1970\u2019s, neural networks have helped to solve complex problems that are difficult to solve with traditional algorithms. These networks learn from data and improve their performance over time, making them powerful tools for a wide range of applications in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, decision-making, and prediction tasks. At its core, a neural network imitates the way the human brain operates using a series of algorithms that recognize relationships in a set of data. Within this framework, each neural network is comprised of multiple layers that allows it to learn complex relationships from the training data. Although additional layers make a neural network more powerful, they also make it more difficult to train. This is because as layers go deeper into the network, the signals can become too large or too small. Weight initialization provides a way to control the size of the signals through setting initial parameters in neural network models prior to training the models on a dataset. There are two ways of doing this. The first way uses old weight initialization approaches that may not be compatible with new neural network designs. The second option requires calculating the scaling manually, which can be rather complicated. Although plausible solutions, both of these restrict the network from doing well in diverse settings. AutoInit is able to remedy these obstacles by stopping signals from getting too large or too small. The algorithm is based upon calculating an analytic mean- and variance-preserving weight initialization for neural networks automatically, making machine learning experiments accurate and reliable. Ultimately, instead of having to calculate how to initialize the weights of the neural network every time, Autoinit will automatically figure out the weight initialization. Weight initialization remains a crucial aspect of developing neural networks. Modern techniques such as AutoInit have garnered much attention as they offer a highly efficient means of obtaining more precise weight initialization. This, in turn, allows researchers to dedicate their efforts towards enhancing other areas of a neural network. The automatic handling of weight initialization has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for improving the performance of other network components. Looking forward, the prospect of automating the entire machine learning process or enabling an AI to self-improve is an exciting possibility. AutoInit represents a significant step in the journey towards automated machine learning and recursive self-improvement.

Delivered by the Department of Computer Science and Machine Learning Laboratory , the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) will be the first large-scale degree program of its kind and the only master\u2019s degree program in AI from a top-ranked institution to be priced close to $10,000. The master\u2019s degree covers about two years\u2019 worth of course content, to be taken at the learner\u2019s own pace, and will be delivered in partnership with online education platform, edX. AI master\u2019s programs from peer institutions carry costs five to 10 times as high as UT Austin\u2019s and serve only dozens of students \u00ad\u2013 not the hundreds or thousands the Texas team projects it will reach annually within five years. Similarly priced online master\u2019s programs from the university, in computer science and data science , enroll 2,500 students within less than five years of their launch. Like those programs, the fully online MSAI program is both flexible and accessible. Enrolled students will receive advanced training in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, deep learning and related topics, and will provide a critical framework for understanding the ethical implications of AI technologies. The degree will equip students for an array of potential career opportunities \u2013 from engineering to research and development, and product management to consulting. \u201cThe fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning have seen unprecedented growth over the last 10 years,\u201d said Adam Klivans, a professor of computer science and director of the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML) , which is providing resources to aid in curriculum design. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that every qualified student can access a premier education in AI, one that is keeping pace with this rapidly evolving field. With the MSAI program, we have removed geographic barriers entirely and significantly lowered the cost barrier of graduate study. For our students, this a game changer.\u201d The degree program comes amid a national conversation about how advances in AI and machine learning might reshape the economy and the workforce. Conscious of the ethical questions inherent to these new technologies, MSAI incorporates formal AI ethics training developed through a partnership between IFML and faculty from the UT\u2019s Good Systems project \u2013 a research initiative to develop new AI technologies around core values that serve the greater societal good. As the third large-scale master\u2019s degree offered as part of the university\u2019s Computer and Data Science Online suite of degree programs, the MSAI will rely on long-standing strengths and faculty expertise that have earned UT Austin a top-10 ranking in artificial intelligence from U.S. News & World Report . \u201cWe\u2019ve developed the curriculum for the MSAI program with faculty members who are leaders in their fields and committed to student success,\u201d said Eric Busch, director of the Computer and Data Science Online program. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an \u2018online degree.\u2019 It\u2019s an immersive and connected community of learners and a credential from UT Austin that opens doors.\u201d The degree is pending final approval by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Leaders of the Computer and Data Science Online program will give a presentation at the South by Southwest Festival\u2019s SXSW EDU 2023 on the future of online graduate education at major research universities. More about the program, including how and when to apply for spring 2024, can be found at the UT MSAI website .

As a result, one team will advance to the ICPC North America Division Championships on Mon, 29 May 2023. The competition consisted of 35+ teams from Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. UT Austin's top team came in 1st (Aaryan Prakash, Caleb Hu, Mark Wen), solving 10 of the 13 problems. All six of our teams finished in the top eight ! UT has been competing in the regionals since 1997. UT went to the 2016-17 world finals in South Dakota, the 2017-18 world finals in Beijing, the 2018-19 world finals in Portugal, and the 2019-20 world finals in Moscow. Last year's team will compete at the 2021-22 world finals in Sharm El-Sheikh this fall. UT has seen marked improvement since creating a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming , taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing and the student officers of the UT Programming Contest. The ICPC traced its roots to 1970 when pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society hosted the first competition. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to increase the ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities of the strongest students in the field of computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition, with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the tournament has expanded into a worldwide collaboration of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world's universities. The ICPC is part of the ICPC Foundation . The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The tournament has raised the aspirations and performance of generations of the world's problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering.

    "text_content": "Exploring Annotator Rationales for Active Learning with Transformers | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Exploring Annotator Rationales for Active Learning with Transformers Posted by Trinity Erales on Wednesday, December 14, 2022 For decades, natural language processing (NLP) has provided methods for computers to understand language in a way that mimics humans. Since they are built on transformers, complex neural network layers, these large language models' decision making processes are usually incomprehensible to humans and require large amounts of data to be trained properly. In the past, researchers have tried to remedy this by having models explain their decisions by providing rationales, short excerpts of data that contributed most to the label. To create these models, large amounts of rational data are needed. In order to decrease the high costs of gathering data, active learning is often implemented to increase the efficiency of training data for NLP models. While researching this topic, recent UT Austin graduate Didi Zhou found that although transformers are widely used for NLP tasks, active learning has not been put into practice with transformer models and rationales before. Overseen by Professor Matt Lease , Postdoctoral Researcher Venelin Kovachev, and PhD student Anubrata Das, Zhou was able to explore techniques that would make it possible to incorporate active learning into transformer-based NLP models with rationales. Eventually, Zhou\u2019s work could allow for future developments providing transparency in decision making processes and further enable interactive machine learning where humans can correct machine rationales in decision making. In order to grasp the importance of Zhou's research, there first needs to be an understanding of how active learning works. Active learning is commonly used to decrease the amount of total data needed for a model while maintaining performance. It does this through identifying examples that provide the most amount of useful information to the model. The model is then trained with the pre-selected data, which significantly decreases the cost and time needed to label large amounts of data. Didi simulated active learning on a model that would both make a decision on its given task and give a rationale for that decision. Active learning was simulated by taking an existing labeled rationale dataset on fact-checking and withholding the labels from the model, only providing the label when the data is selected as important. To do this, first, a portion of the full data set is labeled and used to train the model. The remaining, unlabeled, portion is what the model is evaluated on. After this process occurs, the data is ranked based on different selection criteria. Several selection criteria were evaluated, some of which followed traditional active learning methods and were based on the model\u2019s performance on the end task, predicting whether a claim is supported or refuted by a document, while others explored using the model\u2019s predicted rationales. Top data points are removed from the unlabeled data group then placed into the labeled group. The model is then re-trained with this new labeled data and the process repeats itself until the set amount of data is used. In doing this, Zhou\u2019s research emulated active learning, proving its effectiveness on transformer-based models with rationales. In the future, this work could potentially help create models where humans could correct a model\u2019s rationales to enable more interactive machine learning. Zhou\u2019s research helps to bridge the gap between machine and human knowledge and has laid an important foundation for future work utilizing active learning on transformer models with rationales. Didi reflected on her experience doing research in the Turing Scholars Honor Program , and expressed appreciation for her mentors\u2019 guidance, support from her cohort, and the opportunity to participate in such a valuable research experience. The Turing Scholars Honor Program is an honors program for undergraduate students working toward a degree in computer science. It enables students to enhance their research experience through close interaction with faculty and an opportunity to write an honors thesis. Zhou emphasized that while the thesis initially felt like a daunting task, it instilled confidence in her ability to produce meaningful research. Didi Zhou is now an associate product manager at Google and continues to explore her research interests, hoping to one day pursue the research field full-time.

The Texas 10 award is an annual recognition given to ten outstanding UT Austin faculty members who have made significant contributions to their respective fields. Dillig's selection for the Texas 10 award is a well-deserved recognition of her contributions to the field of computer science and her dedication to teaching and mentoring. \u201cBasically, my job is raising a new generation of researchers and getting them to think through what makes for an interesting research problem,\u201d Dillig says. \u201cComputer science isn\u2019t all about programming, It\u2019s about thinking. I hope my students walk away with the ability to think independently and develop problem-solving skills. It\u2019s not just memorizing stuff, but really the ability to think through things and approach problems in new and innovative ways. I think that\u2019s really important,\u201d she says. That\u2019s a big part of what she teaches in her discrete mathematics course for honors computer science students. The class has a reputation for being hard, she says, but the students enjoy it anyway because she makes it as interactive as possible. Instead of just lecturing or solving math problems herself, she calls for volunteers to work through problems on their own in front of the class. \u201cAs they\u2019re putting the solution on the board, I\u2019ll explain what\u2019s going on. Or if there\u2019s an issue, I\u2019ll get the class to engage: \u2018What do you guys think? What\u2019s going on here? What are your comments?\u2019 And I try to make it interactive and engaging so they\u2019re not passively learning,\u201d Dillig says. Most professors at UT are dedicated to helping their students find jobs after graduation. Dillig has taken that to the next level\u2014she\u2019s hiring them. In addition to her teaching and research, she recently cofounded Verdise Inc., a company that provides security solutions for blockchain services. \u201cThe idea behind this research area is to develop techniques to automatically improve program correctness and automatically find bugs and security vulnerabilities and programs,\u201d Dillig says. \u201cI recently got interested in blockchain. So, I was approached by investors who saw my research. One of my former students and one of my current students who were working on this [with me], we decided to join forces.\u201d Excerpt from the Alcalde 's Introducing the 2023 Texas 10 article.

For the Fall 2004 Visions lectures, UTCS celebrated professors Stephen W. Keckler and David Zuckerman for their recent awards and honors. Stephen W. Keckler received the 2003 Grace Murray Hopper Award and Professor David Zuckerman received a 2004 Guggenheim Fellowship. Each honoree presented a talk on the topic of their choosing. Dr. Keckler spoke on \"A Rise From the Ashes - Dataflow Architectures,\" addressing the history and the potential future of data flow architectures. Dr. Zuckerman spoke on \"Extracting Randomness: Past and Future,\" which discussed the problems and research on reandomness and computation. Agenda: 5 - 6 p.m. Lecture Program, Avaya Auditorium (ACES 2.302) Dr. J Strother Moore, Chair -- Remarks and introductions Dr. Steven Keckler -- Lecture Dr. David Zuckerman -- Lecture 6 - 7 p.m. Invitation Only Reception, ACES 6.102 Stephen W. Keckler will speak on \"A Rise From the Ashes - Dataflow Architectures\" Image Stephen W. Keckler Abstract: Dataflow architectures were once thought to be capable of attaining the holy grail of computer architecture - easily programmable massive parallelism. While many prototypes were built in the 70's and 80's, architects were never able to overcome the overheads inherent in dataflow instruction execution and the inability to efficiently provide common idioms such as iteration and rewritable memory semantics. In the 90's however, microprocessor architects found use for \"dataflow in the small\" as a means of implementing out-of-order instruction execution. While effective, these techniques require substantial hardware to reconstruct the dataflow graphs dynamically, and are reaching their complexity and power scaling limits. This lecture will outline a renaissance in dataflow architectures, called Explicit Datagraph Execution or (EDGE), enabled by nanoscale technology as well as instruction set and compiler innovations. These EDGE architectures provide scalability, efficiency, and programmability not achievable von Neumann or traditional dataflow models. David Zuckerman will speak on \"Extracting Randomness: Past and Future\" David Zuckerman Image Abstract: Randomness is extremely useful in computer science, but obtaining truly random bits is expensive. Is true randomness really necessary? Randomness extractors are a tool to attack this question. An extractor is an algorithm which extracts randomness from a low-quality random source, using some additional truly random bits. This lecture will survey extractors and their applications to seemingly unrelated areas, and discuss where research in this area is heading.

The new attack technique, dubbed Hertzbleed , upends decades of guidance for how to write encryption software and may lead to widespread patching as developers come to terms with its implications. A team of researchers including Ph.D. student Yingchen Wang and professor Hovav Shacham from The University of Texas at Austin has found that a common feature of modern computer processors can make even carefully written encryption software reveal its secrets when probed by an attacker. The new attack technique, dubbed Hertzbleed , upends decades of guidance for how to write encryption software and may lead to widespread patching as developers come to terms with its implications. They described the attack technique in a peer-reviewed paper released last week and accepted for presentation at the Usenix Security Symposium in August. The work was also highlighted in New Scientist and Ars Technica . The new attack technique takes advantage of a thermostat-like mechanism that processors use to run programs as quickly as possible without overheating. When the processor is using more power than its cooling system can dissipate, this mechanism slows down the processor; when the processor is using less power, this mechanism speeds it up. The adjustment happens hundreds of times per second. The team showed that a remote hacker can use changes in how long a processor takes to do certain operations, which correlates with these changes in speed, to steal sensitive information. As a case study of the new attack's effectiveness, the researchers showed how an attacker could extract secret keys from two implementations of SIKE , an encryption algorithm designed to withstand even predicted code-breaking abilities of future quantum computers, and a candidate for standardization by the U.S. government. The researchers alerted the companies who developed the SIKE software they examined\u2014Microsoft and Cloudflare\u2014as well as chipmaker Intel last year. Microsoft and Cloudflare released patches to secure their SIKE software against Hertzbleed. Intel acknowledged that all its processors are affected, but declined to release any patches. It's not clear yet what impact this type of attack may have on ordinary computer users, as SIKE is not widely used outside of the research community. But the team is evaluating other pieces of software to see if they are vulnerable and encourages other software developers to test their programs. The software routines responsible for encryption, in popular programs like Web browsers, are especially challenging for programmers to write: not only must they produce the right answer, they must also always take exactly the same time to produce it, regardless of the secret value they operate on. Otherwise, as decades of research have shown, attackers can take advantage of the timing variations to learn the secrets the software operates on. To prevent such attacks, programmers writing encryption modules have followed a restrictive rulebook for \"constant-time\" programming, trying to make sure that each operation on secret information always takes the same amount of time to complete. When processors operated at a fixed speed, that was sufficient to protect the information, but now that they change speed dynamically, that's no longer the case. \"Hertzbleed throws the rulebook for how programmers write constant-time code out the window,\" Wang, the UT Ph.D. student said. \"We look forward to working with the community to rewrite it and help keep users safe.\" The team, which also includes Riccardo Paccagnella, Elizabeth Tang He, and Christopher Fletcher from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and David Kohlbrenner from University of Washington, will present their findings at the Usenix Security Symposium.

    "text_content": "Can Robots and Humans Co-Exist in Public? UT Campus Study Will Offer Answers | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Can Robots and Humans Co-Exist in Public? UT Campus Study Will Offer Answers Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, October 20, 2022 Autonomous robots will soon rove the buildings and streets of The University of Texas at Austin campus. But unlike other commercial delivery services, this fleet of robots will help researchers understand and improve the experience of pedestrians who encounter them. A new grant to an interdisciplinary team of researchers at UT Austin, including computer scientists Justin Hart and Joydeep Biswas , will support the creation of a robot delivery network on campus, with the first deployments scheduled for early 2023. The researchers plan a five-year study focusing on what it takes to create, safely operate and maintain this kind of robot network, while also adapting with the humans who live and work around it. The team's research promises to become the most extensive data about human-robot encounters in public spaces to date. Over time, the team will learn how state-of-the-art robotic autonomy and a real-world community can best co-exist. The researchers plan to use two different types of dog-like robots made by Boston Dynamics and Unitree. In later phases of the research, the robots will go out in teams of two, monitored both by chaperones and people remotely. When the network is up and running, members of the UT Austin community will be able to order free supplies such as wipes and hand sanitizer via a smartphone app. The robots will deliver them to certain pedestrian zones on campus, door-to-door. The robots seen will potentially encounter hundreds of pedestrians. The researchers want to understand the behaviors and interactions that are expected from the robots during these encounters. Justin Hart, an assistant professor of practice in the Department of Computer Science explains \u201cA warehouse automation robot can be designed to work around people, but the people are trained to know how the robot will behave, and what things will hinder its work. If you consider a robot that needs to interact with people in order to get its job done, the robot must be able both to make itself understood through a variety of communication modalities and to understand people through all of those modalities as well.\u201d Through completing this research, systems can be developed enabling robots to communicate information to pedestrians effectively as well as understand social cues that they may encounter on a day to day basis. Studied through the Good Systems research grand challenge, the new $3.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation expands on their six-year project Living and Working with Robots, which kicked off in September 2021. The researchers expect to gain insights from observing and interviewing people who encounter the robots in a variety of contexts. Importantly, the team knows reactions will vary widely and wants to develop tools for understanding the full range of experiences encountering robots on campus can produce. This work could help designers figure out how future public-facing robots should be designed to co-exist within diverse communities like UT Austin's, as well as how and where they should move. Elliott Hauser, an assistant professor in the School of Information, will lead the development of a shared research database that will collect and relate the many types of data the team and its robots will generate. Justin Hart, an assistant professor of practice with the College of Natural Sciences, is leading human-robot interactions in the community. Keri Stephens, a professor in the Moody College of Communication, is leading team science efforts. Joydeep Biswas, assistant professor of computer science in the College of Natural Sciences, is leading robot navigation in social environments. Junfeng Jiao of the College of Liberal Arts will research how urban informatics and smart cities research can inform the deploying robots in social environments. Maria Esteva of the Texas Advanced Computing Center is leading the development of the project's convergent data model. Samantha Shorey, assistant professor of communication studies in the Moody College of Communication, is leading the group's work on ethnographic studies of the community and the research team itself.

    "text_content": "UT Computer Science Mourns the Loss of Professor Dana Ballard | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Computer Science Mourns the Loss of Professor Dana Ballard Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, November 14, 2022 It is with great sadness that we inform the scientific community of the passing of an international giant. Dana Ballard passed away on Nov 3rd, 2022, at the age of 76. It is hard to single out Dana\u2019s \u201csignature\u201d work among his many achievements. Over the past few decades, his unabated scientific curiosity drove him deeply into multiple interrelated fields in computer vision and artificial intelligence, vision science, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The interdisciplinary nature of his research created synergistic insights that were always ahead of his time. His work led to paradigm-shifting contributions not in just one but in multiple research fields. Perhaps one way to share Dana\u2019s research journey is to go through the pathways Dana has created that connect those scientific fields. From computer vision to human vision. Most of Dana\u2019s early work was on computer vision. In 1982, with Chris Brown, Dana co-authored a highly influential first textbook on computer vision. Around the same time, he invented two powerful algorithms -- Color Indexing and Generalized Hough Transform \u2013 which are still widely used. In 1985, Dana led a team that designed and built a high-speed binocular camera control system capable of simulating human eye movements. This system led to an increased understanding of the role of action in simplifying visual tasks. From behavior to the brain. In 1995, Dana and his longtime collaborator Mary Hayhoe developed an experimental setup to capture time-locked multimodal data from mobile eye trackers and motion tracking devices with precise measurements of freely moving participants in natural situations. With this technological breakthrough, they conducted a series of studies to examine how behavioral programs control the selection of visual information and, in particular, the pervasive role of the task in guiding where and when to deploy gaze. To further examine the top-down effects on vision and attention, in 1999, Dana and his Ph.D. student Rajesh Rao published a predictive neural coding model which could explain a vast amount of data from visual cortex. From computational models to cognitive theories. By combining computational and experimental approaches, these seminal works collectively led to three major theoretical contributions: 1) Predictive coding. Dana\u2019s research suggested that the brain uses its prior knowledge of the world to generate hypotheses about the causes of incoming sensory information based on an internal model. Due to his work, probably the majority of neuroscientists now see the brain as a \u201cprediction machine.\u201d 2) Active vision. Through Dana\u2019s work, the field discovered that biologically motivated active vision could be much more efficient than static image analysis. Sensorimotor tasks are easier when sensors are closely integrated with effectors. 3) Embodied cognition. A seminal paper proposed that the physical world serves as our memory and that deictic behavior serves to link the brain and the external world. This idea has stirred much interest not only in vision science but also in philosophy. Dana was a fabulous mentor and a great colleague. His trainees will remember him for his intelligence, his humor, and his kindness. Dana found ways to create unique soil to nurture many different flowers to blossom. I am sure that there are many fun memories of Dana that would bring smiles to his colleagues and friends at the University of Rochester and the University of Texas at Austin. He was one of the kindest people I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with. I, for one, will forever be grateful for his contributions to science and for his kindness and support in my life. Dana Ballard was a true giant in the field. His research has always been \u201cahead of the curve.\u201d He was an influential thinker and an innovative experimenter. Dana will long be remembered for his outstanding accomplishments, his compassion, his strength, his style, and his commitment to science.

One such start-up created by UT Computer Science alumni was recently obtained by Ibotta in a multi-million-dollar acquisition deal. Formerly known as InStok, OctoShop was a browser extension that helped users navigate online shopping during March of 2020, when the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic caused an inventory crisis for items such as toilet paper and disinfecting products. \u201cWhen we were watching the news, we realized that we could maybe solve some of these inventory issues,\u201d said Rithwik Pattikonda, co-founder and former CEO. \u201cThat kind of evolved into a browser extension that lets you track items for restock alerts\u2026 we added more features like price comparisons, and like price drop alerts, and kind of tried to build an all-in-one browser extension for shopping online.\u201d As OctoShop grew, the start-up was approached by Ibotta, a major cash-back rewards platform. In a matter of months \u2014 while most of the company\u2019s founding team, which also included Darshan Bhatta and Sriram Hariharan, were still students \u2014the platforms were able to reach a multi-million-dollar deal and OctoShop\u2019s features were integrated into Ibotta. Pattikonda said that the project-based nature of classes at UT and startup specific resources like Longhorn Startup , Convergent , and Genesis helped setup OctoShop for success.  \u201cIf you have an idea, just try to build it out as fast as you can.

    "text_content": "How Novel Encryption Methods Are Making a Future of Online Privacy Possible | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How Novel Encryption Methods Are Making a Future of Online Privacy Possible Posted by Trinity Erales on Thursday, August 4, 2022 Co-written by Trinity Erales and Lauren Cotton Privacy has become increasingly valuable and rare as technology has become more closely integrated with our lives. Private information retrieval (PIR) protocols allow you to retrieve information through an encoded query while also protecting your personal information. Our current security standard online can be viewed as a \u201cno-privacy baseline,\u201d which means the vast majority of our online information retrieval isn\u2019t protected by any of these protocols. Cryptographers like UT Computer Science professor David Wu are building innovative solutions that support this growing preference for online privacy. In a joint paper with Samir Menon titled \u201c Spiral: Fast, High-Rate Single-Server PIR via FHE Composition \u201d  Professor Wu introduces the Spiral family of single-server PIR protocols. Spiral leverages cryptographic techniques to first encrypt user queries before they are sent to the server. The server can then directly compute the encrypted query and derive an encrypted response. Users can then decrypt the result to learn the requested record. This encryption scheme is homomorphic, specifically, it allows computation on the encrypted data in a way that does not require decryption of the query by the database. The computations (retrieving requested information for example) are performed on the ciphertext itself. Homomorphic encryption is a technique for computing on encrypted data. As a simple example, consider an encrypted calculator. Suppose you wanted to calculate the sum of two plus three without revealing the inputs to the calculator. Using homomorphic encryption, you would first generate a secret key and use it to encrypt the values two and three. This yields two ciphertexts, which would resemble long random-looking strings which hide the values two and three. The calculator would then take those ciphertexts, and apply an \u201caddition\u201d algorithm on the encrypted values. This yields an encryption of their sum, but does not leak any information about the inputs to the user. Given the encrypted output, the user can then use their secret key to decrypt and learn the sum. Only the holder of the secret key is able to decrypt. How can we use such an encryption scheme to construct a private information retrieval scheme? For simplicity, consider an example database with just three records. Let's say the user is interested in retrieving record 2. To do so, the user would construct an indicator vector. The indicator vector is \u201c1\u201d when the user is interested in retrieving the record and \u201c0\u201d in all other positions (the vector in this example would be [0,1,0]). Then, the user encrypts the vector using the homomorphic encryption scheme described in the last paragraph. To construct the response, the database will multiply each component with the record in the database then sum up the results. This yields an encryption of the desired record the user wished to return. Overall, the main challenge in private information retrieval is reducing the total communication. The basic protocol described here is inefficient as the query the user inputs is essentially as big as the database itself. However, through composing two homomorphic encryption schemes, the Spiral system can reduce communication through enabling trade-offs in the total upload/downloads made and the amounts of server-side computation. Spiral has achieved many impressive results. For example, a base version of Spiral simultaneously reduces query size by four-and-a-half times, decreases response size by one-and-a-half times, and doubles the server throughput compared to all previous systems. Additionally, and arguably most importantly, in settings where communication costs dominate (e.g., serving content on Amazon Web Services), the monetary cost of using a protocol like Spiral is estimated to only be 1.9 times more than the no-privacy baseline where the client directly downloads the desired record. Solutions like these are critical to a future in which full privacy online is feasible. To showcase the viability of private information retrieval, Wu and Menon have built a live demo using Spiral to privately browse a subset of Wikipedia . After an initial (one-time) client-side setup, articles can be loaded in just a span of 3-4 seconds. The server in this case has no information about which articles the client requested.

    "text_content": "How the Intersection of Accessibility and Computer Science Leads to Inclusive Tech | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How the Intersection of Accessibility and Computer Science Leads to Inclusive Tech Posted by Lauren Cotton on Monday, May 9, 2022 This semester UT Computer Science welcomed Amy Pavel as a new assistant professor. Pavel's work sits at the intersection of accessibility and computer science. Her research at UT Austin expands on these themes by exploring how people with disabilities as well as those with different situations and preferences interact with emerging forms of media such as virtual reality and augmented reality. While Pavel\u2019s previous projects often centered around making visual content accessible to people who were blind or visually impaired, her research at UT Austin explores more complex media such as VR and AR environments alongside video as well. Pavel is utilizing established techniques used to make videos accessible and is continuing that pursuit as well as refashioning those solutions to fit new forms of media like virtual reality and augmented reality as well as tangibles and robots. While for decades our main forms of communication online were text-based (and therefore easy to translate to people with visual impairments through screen readers) VR and AR environments present new challenges in how creators approach the task of effectively communicating content to a wide audience. VR presents full environments where the task of automating a description is made more complex through the presence of 360 degrees of content. Additionally, augmented reality presents additional problems through the complexity of communicating both digital and physical stimuli. Both of these forms of media additionally often require certain motor abilities to fully interact with the content. All these challenges are a part of the exciting frontier that Pavel is investigating through her research. While increasing accessibility is an important impact of her research, her investigations intend to alleviate obstacles that might hinder effective communication across a variety of situations. She described this perspective by highlighting that when any piece of media is created, there are certain abilities that the audience member is assumed to have. These abilities might include sightedness, hearing, or even an assumption that their audience is able to pay full attention without distraction. However, with our modern digital communications reaching out to larger audiences than ever before, it has become less likely that the real audience will match the default audience that was assumed when making the content. For example, an audience member could be a commuter who cannot watch visual content while driving or may be nearsighted and in need of some more detailed descriptions until they find their glasses. There are many ways in which media currently isn\u2019t perfectly suited for its real-life audience. When asked for a specific fact that surprised her through her research so far, Pavel explained how: \"blind users that I've talked to mentioned that no one ever wants the exact same thing.\u201d And she further explained how, for example, one viewer might be interested in hearing about the events that occurred in a video clip while another might be more interested in the costume design or scenery instead. Changing our perspective to focusing on creating automated solutions that adjust to viewers' abilities, situations, and interests is a key cornerstone of her current research. To put it succinctly, Pavel described that: \u201cthe goal is to make the media we are creating more accessible to a much broader range of audiences and allow people to efficiently accomplish their goals with that media.\" This semester she taught a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course and is excited to continue introducing computer science students to the field. This course involves a study of how to create effective user interfaces and her research expands on these topics to investigate the plethora of interactive techniques in the context of augmented and virtual reality as well as in general what human interactions with computers will look like in the future.

The National Science Foundation has awarded a grant to computer scientists from Rice University, The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Washington to develop runtime programmable networks that can respond to real-time changes rapidly and without interruption of service. Aditya Akella , Regents Chair in Computer Sciences #1, heads the UT Austin part of the team. The Rice recipients are Ang Chen , assistant professor of CS, and T. S. Eugene Ng , professor of CS, both with joint appointments in electrical and computer engineering. Deploying new features into a running network \"requires meticulous planning well ahead of time,\" Akella commented. \"We aim to remove this barrier by developing runtime programmable networks which can effect a desired change in seconds without downtime.\" The researchers, who have dubbed their vision FlexNet, are collaborating closely with leading industry players to realize it and deploy the technologies. \"Runtime programmability,\" Chen said, \"aims to transform the way cloud infrastructure is used and operated due to its fast response to live changes.\" \"In today's network programming paradigm,\" Ng said, \"developing new features is already easier than ever, but deploying these new features into a running network requires broad maintenance to avoid disruption of service.\" Recipients from UW are Arvind Krishnamurthy , the Short-Dooley Professor, and Thomas Anderson, the Warren Francis and Wilma Kolm Bradley Chair, both at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. The FlexNet team will hold a kickoff workshop at Rice on Aug. 25-26. Industry partners from eleven companies, including Microsoft, Google, AMD, and Ericsson, will be represented. This post was adapted from a press release by Rice University.

Fleischmann, Will Griffin, Mikel Rodriguez and Alice Xiang at the 2022 Good Systems Symposium. Credit - Stacey Ingram Kaleh. The University of Texas at Austin and the MITRE Corporation, a nonprofit dedicated to solving problems for a safer world, have formed a partnership that includes accelerating innovative ethical artificial intelligence (AI) research currently underway by interdisciplinary teams of researchers who are part of UT Austin's Good Systems research grand challenge. The partnership will involve Peter Stone and Justin Hart from UT Computer Science, as well as other experts from the Cockrell School of Engineering, the School of Information, and the Department of Defense Research Advancement. AI technologies are being adopted rapidly across a wide range of industries due to the increased efficiency and convenience they can provide. However, the widespread adoption of some AI technologies can cause adverse societal effects, among them job losses, increased economic inequality, infringements on privacy, overreliance on biased algorithms and data sets, and the disruption of elections and of the social fabric. \"Good Systems is honored to partner with MITRE to work toward our shared goal of ensuring that AI will serve the public interest,\" said Kenneth R. Fleischmann, founding chair of Good Systems and a professor in the School of Information. \"AI innovation should be leveraged to enhance our economic competitiveness and national security, and it is also critical that we harness the benefits of AI to steer toward a more equitable and just society.\" In 2019, the university launched Good Systems , one of three Bridging Barriers research grand challenges that bring together researchers from dozens of disciplines to address major issues affecting our world. Since then, technologists, social scientists and humanists participating in Good Systems have been working to define, evaluate and build ethical AI systems in six core areas: Enhancing middle-skill work with smart hand tools Designing responsible AI to curb disinformation Developing AI systems for smarter cities Embedding ethics in public camera AI technologies Designing AI to advance racial equity Living and working with robots MITRE's investment of $1 million in support of Good Systems will allow investment in capacity building in these core areas by expanding its team expertise and supporting a greater number of faculty members, researchers and students to engage in this work. This gift will serve as a model for an ongoing flagship partnership with UT Austin and will be coordinated by Defense Research Advancement in the Office of the Vice President for Research, Scholarship and Creative Endeavors. The collaboration between Good Systems and MITRE was made possible through the efforts of the UT Austin Cockrell School of Engineering, College of Natural Sciences, School of Information and Department of Defense Research Advancement, including facilitating a MITRE site visit to UT Austin during February. In addition, Mikel Rodriguez, the director of MITRE's Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy Innovation Center, was an invited speaker at the Good Systems Symposium in April. Fleischmann will be an invited speaker at MITRE's Grand Challenges Power Hour: Building Trust \u2013 AI Assurance in Industries & Mission Critical Systems in July. \"As consequential use of AI increases, it is vital that we address safety, security and equity concerns,\" said Douglas Robbins, vice president of engineering and prototyping at MITRE Labs. \"We are thrilled to be working with UT Austin and Good Systems to advance the underlying science in these areas that will enable us to build AI systems that can reach their full potential.\" Cross-posted from the College of Natural Sciences News News Categories Research Tags Artificial Intelligence Intelligent Robotics Peter Stone Justin Hart",

But the copyright system does not fit well with computer networks, and only draconian punishments can enforce it. The global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying for draconian punishments and to increase their copyright powers, while suppressing public access to technology. But if we seriously hope to serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright--to promote progress, for the benefit of the public--then we must make changes in the other direction. Speaker Bio Richard Stallman launched the development of the GNU operating system (see www.gnu.org ) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. The GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer award and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several honorary doctorates.

Although most of her family were in the humanities, they nurtured her unique interests in her early years. The definite logic and reasoning of mathematical concepts struck a chord with her that encouraged her curiosity in the field. As she pursued this curiosity as an undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science, it became clear to her that she had found her purpose. Dr. John had always planned on moving to the US for her Ph.D. and when she visited Austin she immediately knew that this was the place for her. Her visit included a tour of the department, where she was able to see the research-focused culture first-hand. All the faculty that she spoke with within the computer science department encouraged her to apply for their Ph.D. program, and she happily obliged. During her time at UT, Ajita focused on distributed systems and programming languages. She worked heavily with Professor JC Browne and reflected afterward that UT is \u201ca place that encourages clear thinking, clear logical thinking. ...that has carried me through.\u201d Her dissertation was in graphical parallel programming languages and her training in research and foundational computer science prepared her for subsequent research areas she would pursue post doc such as network management, social computing, machine learning, and natural language processing. Even though her coursework was stimulating, Dr. John described the unique challenges of being a woman in the field of computer science. Dr. John saw a need for community among her female classmates and began meeting with them for a monthly coffee hour. During these meetings, the environment felt comfortable and inclusive, and the women were able to bond and support one another through the demands of their rigorous academic work with the assurance that they were not alone. After graduating from UT with her Ph.D. in the class of 1997, she was eager to find a work environment where she could continue working alongside passionate researchers. Her strong foundational education in CS provided her with the tools to succeed in publishing groundbreaking research and even invented a piece of conferencing software at Avaya Labs. This software, called \u201cCollaborative Life Tagging,\u201d would tag sections of recorded audio in real-time for easier review. After a while, she outgrew Avaya Labs and created a startup called Koopid with several of her colleagues. Koopid is a customer service chatbot software that businesses can utilize to help automate effective customer service. Now, about 5 years later, Dr. John is the Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at Koopid and teaches as an adjunct professor at Rutgers University. \u201cThere\u2019s an amazing amount of things you can achieve if you think of the right solution\u2026 the things that you build have the power to change and impact people\u2019s lives\u201d News Categories Alumni Undergraduate Program Tags Alumni James C.

    "text_content": "How SYNERGY Provides a Glimpse Into the Future of Computing Infrastructure Efficiency | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content How SYNERGY Provides a Glimpse Into the Future of Computing Infrastructure Efficiency Posted by Trinity Erales on Friday, September 23, 2022 As the technological world advances, it has become increasingly difficult for the speed of computers to improve. UT Computer Science Professor Dr. Chris Rossbach's research in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) virtualization has made significant strides in the development of a more efficient computing infrastructure. Developing a system called SYNERGY , Rossbach and his team are able to explore techniques that would make it possible to virtualize FPGAs in a data center environment. This method would allow computers to become more efficient and reduce the amount of overall energy consumed. The ability to create smaller transistors has, in the past, been the most common technique for creating faster, more efficient processors. However, as it has become increasingly difficult to create smaller transistors that are actually power-efficient, specialized hardware has become a popular way to increase performance. To keep up with technological demand, a new generation of hardware called accelerators has been designed to address these issues. For example, graphics processing units (GPU) are useful for gaming applications because they can simultaneously process many pieces of data. FPGAs are a unique type of specialized hardware because they are reconfigurable, meaning they can be reprogrammed in hardware definition languages to be any kind of specialized hardware accelerator. To understand Rossbach's research, it must be understood why FPGAs are not widely used in data centers in this way. While FPGAs are a good alternative for creating arbitrary accelerators, they are difficult to virtualize. Virtualization is a way for a single machine to provide an abstraction of many virtual machines, allowing users to manage and share resources. It has become the key technology that has made cloud computing possible. If FPGAs are to be used to help power efficiency problems in the cloud, there must be a good solution to make virtualizing them possible. This is where Rossbach's research in SYNERGY is crucial. SYNERGY virtualizes FPGAs so they may be used in data centers. While standard accelerators can capture the state of a program and then store or transfer data, FPGAs cannot because they do not contain an interface that describes the state of a running program. Instead, SYNERGY is able to interpose on the language layer for virtualization. In language-level interposition, a program called a compiler can translate the original programming code into a machine code. In this case, the compiler takes a Verilog program\u2014 a hardware description language commonly used to program FPGAs\u2014 and rewrites it to expose interfaces, making it possible to capture the program's state at that moment. Simply speaking, one may write a program in Verilog and feed it to the SYNERGY compiler which then produces what a typical FPGA would produce and additional logic, exposing the state of the running program using that hardware. The product of this process is hardware acceleration logic that can be virtualized. FPGAs have continued to become more important in both production and general-purpose acceleration. Techniques for virtualizing FPGAs are in demand because they can provide flexible on-demand hardware acceleration in data centers. While manufacturers have looked to address this problem through hardware approaches, SYNERGY could eventually provide a more effective compiler-based solution to virtualize FPGAs. In the future, Rossbach\u2019s SYNERGY could be an efficient and effective approach to FPGA virtualization for the cloud.

    "text_content": "Shacham Receives NSF Grant for Cybersecurity Research | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Shacham Receives NSF Grant for Cybersecurity Research Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, November 10, 2021 The National Science Foundation (NSF) has announced four new flagship funding awards through the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program , including for a project focused on securing web browser operations led by Hovav Shacham , professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. A key element of web browsers is called a Just-In-Time compiler (JIT), which is designed to speed up webpage loading and functionality. But JavaScript JITs can and have been exploited by attackers to target vulnerable users. The goal of Shacham's research project is to build and deploy more secure JavaScript JITs. \"Everyday users are being targeted by malware that takes advantage of bugs in browser JavaScript compilers,\" Shacham said. \"Through this project, we will bring together experts in security, programming languages, compilers and formal verification to build JavaScript compilers that can eliminate such attacks by design.\" Bugs in JavaScript JITs have emerged as the single largest threat to web platform security and the most dangerous attack surface of web-connected devices. To tackle this challenge, investigators from UT Austin and the University of California San Diego will develop new techniques, frameworks, and principles that (1) help browser developers build JIT compilers that are provably secure and (2) don't incur the high costs and development timelines traditionally associated with high-assurance software. If successful, this project will improve security for the hundreds of millions of people who surf the web every day. These four flagship awards from the NSF are complemented by over 100 other SaTC awards made over the past year, for a total investment of nearly $80 million to tackle cybersecurity issues long term. As a whole, these awards reflect SaTC's vision that cybersecurity is a socio-technical problem that requires cross-disciplinary solutions to the challenges facing American society and the US economy. These projects bring together computer scientists and social scientists to address critical problems including inaccurate online information, vulnerabilities in widely used web browsers, and balancing the benefits and risks of encrypted communications \u2013 all necessary to protect the online experience central to modern American life, especially during the pandemic. \"To achieve a reliable cyberspace that enhances our Nation's economic, security, and socio-technical leadership, requires investments in foundational research that seeks innovative ideas to address cybersecurity and privacy, and result in reliable and resilient computing systems and online services that enhance our digital experiences,\" said NSF Program Director Jeremy Epstein.

    "text_content": "Exploring Methods to Improve the Psychological Wellness of Content Moderators | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Exploring Methods to Improve the Psychological Wellness of Content Moderators Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Monday, March 7, 2022 When people think of content moderation, they usually imagine some kind of AI program that automatically monitors social media posts to delete inappropriate content. Though some content moderation is indeed performed by AI, a huge part of it is still done manually by people because moderation remains too difficult and nuanced for AI to perform well. In fact, over 100,000 content moderators work globally today to keep the internet safe for the rest of us. Moderating the internet is no easy task. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, 3.5 million items of uncivil or violent content were taken down on Facebook alone. Unfortunately, sitting in front of a computer and scrolling through violent images all day can have serious consequences for mental health. A further challenge is that this massive and necessary work remains largely invisible. When we browse through social media, most people have no idea that tens of thousands of content moderators are working around the clock to keep our browsing safe. In his research article \u201c The Psychological Well-Being of Content Moderators \u201d, UT Prof. Matthew Lease collaborated with a team of researchers to explore how content moderation affects the health of workers and what we can do to better protect them. As Prof. Lease explained \u201cA lot of the problem with content moderation work is that we don\u2019t see it.\u201d Because most people remain unaware of both the existence of human content moderators and the health risks they face each day, the issue has received little public attention or scrutiny. Can we ensure moderator wellbeing without sacrificing accuracy and efficiency? To answer this question, Prof. Lease and his team have been studying the use of image blurring techniques to reduce the moderators\u2019 exposure to disturbing imagery without compromising their work. In the research article \u201c Fast, Accurate, and Healthier: Interactive Blurring Helps Moderators Reduce Exposure to Harmful Content \u201d, the team designed three different user interfaces for blurring images for moderators. They then conducted user studies to understand how each interface impacted the speed and accuracy of moderation work, as well as mental health impacts. They found that neither speed nor accuracy of content moderation were reduced by the interactive blurring technique. In addition, results of a psychological questionnaire also showed reduced negative mental health impacts from the moderation work. While reducing exposure to disturbing imagery is important, Prof. Lease and his co-researchers also recommend creating workplace programs that improve the resilience of moderators, take measures to prevent and reduce exposure to traumatic content as much as possible, and provide better, long-term access to health care.

This is an annual award presented by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from which recipients receive a federal grant for research and education activities. This year two UT Computer Science faculty were selected for the award: Professor Greg Durrett and Assistant Professor Yuke Zhu. Professor Greg Durrett , head of the TAUR Lab (Text Analysis, Understanding, and Reasoning), received funding to continue his lab's work on textual reasoning. Current-generation NLP systems, based on end-to-end deep neural networks, fail in unexpected ways and can mislead their users. These systems lack the ability to reason about and synthesize the information they see, retrieve and integrate additional information, and arrive at a justified conclusion. Durrett's project aims to address this shortcoming by developing systems that explicitly \"think through\" textual evidence, leading to more reliable and explainable answers in settings like question answering and fact checking. Durrett's lab currently receives other funding from DARPA, Salesforce, Amazon, and the Good Systems program at UT Austin. Assistant Professor Yuke Zhu , director of the Robot Perception and Learning Lab as well as a core faculty member of Texas Robotics , will use his funding to continue his research in robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. Within the field of robotics, the current state-of-the-art manipulation algorithms fall short of the readiness required for widespread deployment. The overall objective of Zhu's project is to build new algorithms and tools for intelligent robot manipulation in the real world. Zhu's project will accomplish this by creating a suite of algorithms that build effective abstractions and harness these abstractions to synthesize sophisticated behaviors. Additionally, this project includes an education plan to integrate research into undergraduate and graduate spaces as well as an open-source software initiative and K-12 educational programs for High-schoolers. The NSF Career award is a very prestigious award for early-career professors. This award recognizes highly talented educators who have established a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in the intersect education and research. Professor Greg Durrett and Assistant Professor Yuke Zhu join a long list of past and present UT computer science faculty that have won NSF Career Awards.

When she first arrived at UT, Romelia tried out a few different majors before landing on computer science. She came in as a biology major, then declared a math major due to her love of mathematics. She thoroughly enjoyed mathematics courses, particularly calculus because the formulas and equations were natural for her to understand and logically obtain correct results. However, a definitive moment eventually mapped her career path: a fellow student asked her if she had ever taken a computer course at UT, to which Romelia replied, \u201cWhat's a computer?\u201d Her friend convinced her to take Introduction to Pascal Programming, convincing her that it would be fun. The course the pair took was taught by the now retired, Senior Lecturer Nell Dale \u2014one of the first women to get a PhD in computer science. \u201cShe taught us Pascal programming. It was really amazing. I took that course and remember thinking, \u2018This is so much fun,\u2019 because it was like calculus. You were given a problem and as a programmer, you provided the computer with step-by-step instructions to execute on your behalf. It was similar to solving puzzles which I\u2019ve always enjoyed. That's why I love computer science so much!\u201d She remembers using punch cards to \u201cwrite\u201d her programs and how even though it was arduous and time-consuming, solving problems on the computer systems gave her a sense of accomplishment. When she wasn\u2019t at the IBM campus on Burnet, she would hang out and study with her friends at The Union and the Perry Casta\u00f1eda Library, noting that friendship and community were vital to her happiness at UT. While working on her computer science degree at UT Austin, she obtained a summer internship at IBM and continued to work there part-time as a full-time student. Her first position at IBM was as an assembly-level programmer producing technology products such as 3270 Data Streams and High-Level Language Application Programming Interface (HLLAPI). She received her Bachelor\u2019s in Computer Science in 1982 and was offered a programming job at IBM as a full-time employee. Because she loved working at IBM, she decided to continue her career there ever since. Romelia is now an IBM Distinguished Engineer and Master Inventor known for driving innovative projects which leverage leading-edge technology including hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. She has obtained 73 US Patents with an additional 15 patents pending \u2013 making her one of IBM\u2019s top innovators. Throughout her career, she has served on a variety of committees and boards including the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History Board of Trustees, the Baylor Engineering and Computer Science Board of Advocates, the Dallas Alliance of Technical Women, and the International Women\u2019s Forum. She\u2019s received various awards and honors including being the first female ever named to the Dallas Tech Titan Hall of Fame in 2018, winning the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award from Great Minds in STEM and being named 2016 Latina Style Magazine Executive of the Year. As she mentors IBMers and students, her advice to them is to find something they\u2019re passionate about. She shares what she calls her \u201cC's of Success.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re words that begin with the letter C that make individuals successful \u2013 Competence, Communication, Commitment, Creativity, Collaboration, Confidence, Community and Chuckle.\u201d She is a strong believer in the approach and says that following the C\u2019s of Success will make life more interesting and more valuable in the long run. Romelia remembers the male-dominated engineering and computer science programming staff. She has seen more women joining the workforce over the past decade, but she affirms that she would love to see additional women and minorities in her field. She serves as a role model for women and Hispanic people leading IBM\u2019s Academy of Technology (top IBM engineers) on Diversity and Inclusion efforts. She also works with other Hispanic Executive leaders to focus on diversity initiatives for the IBM company. Romelia\u2019s impressive career has been able to thrive on these ideals because she prioritizes taking care of herself and doing what truly brings her joy. \u201cOne of the things that I was very focused on was getting ahead on my career, but it's really important to do something you really enjoy. People look at me, and say, \u2018I want to be a Distinguished Engineer.\u2019 And I'm like, \u2018what you need to do is think about what makes you happy and position yourself in what's going to make you happy \u2013 regardless of whether it's a Distinguished Engineer position or another.\u2019\u201d For Romelia, true success is defined by doing what makes you happy and what drives you.

    "text_content": "The Importance of Ethics in Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Importance of Ethics in Computer Science Posted by Lauren Cotton on Friday, February 18, 2022 Co-written by Bettina Mateo and Lauren Cotton As society\u2019s reliance on technology increases, computer scientists are now placed at the forefront of new and unique ethical decisions. However, most computer science curriculums don\u2019t require a substantial education in ethics. This can be a troubling thought since a lack of educational discussion on ethical issues can lead scientists to be unaware of the consequences and repercussions of their creations. In an interview with Joyce He, a Computer Science and Business (CSB) honors student and co-founder of ACM for Change (an organization addressing ethics and mental health in the tech industry), she expressed worry about the lack of conversation surrounding ethics in computer science. She described how \u201cit was scary for us to realize how much power tech could have and how if you don\u2019t make tech with an ethical standpoint, you could cause a lot of danger in the world.\u201d During her sophomore year, she and other CS students started to have weekly talks about their experiences navigating the tech industry. They noticed that most of the issues they faced stemmed from a lack of understanding of ethics within the community. Professors and students alike are taking the initiative to promote ethical discussions within the computer science department. One of the key advocates for promoting ethical teaching within CS is Karen Landolt, J.D . who teaches an upper-division Behavioral Ethics course offered to both computer science and business students. Landolt\u2019s course explores \u201creal-life ethical dilemmas, our decision-making processes, and ideal behavior for the future.\u201d Not only are students presented with various frameworks for ethical decision-making in a classroom setting, but through the course\u2019s Academic Service Learning component, students apply these frameworks to real-world problems impacting underserved communities. One student, who took the course in Spring 2017, remarked that the course \u201cmade me evaluate how I approached ethical issues in my life.\u201d Dr. Alison N. Norman (CS professor and faculty lead of the justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion committee) also sees the value in Landolt\u2019s teaching. She explains that many people \u201cthink that being ethical is easy---and it is until it isn't.  Learning how to recognize when a decision may lead down a bad path is a skill, and Professor Landolt is helping students develop that skill in her class. \u201d Professor Landolt\u2019s background as a lawyer made her astutely aware of a major difference between the legal field and the worlds of business and computer science, she explained how within the tech industry \u201cthere is no systematic board or organization that requires them to consider the ethical implications.\u201d As such, Landolt sees it as her duty to prepare her students to think before they act. The undergraduate curriculum committee within the department has also sought to provide more initiatives for teaching ethics to CS students. One important initiative is the inclusion of a Social Impact Stamp in the curriculum. This stamp is designed to raise a student's critical consciousness\u2014their understanding of how computer science intersects with the social forces that shape the world, their ability to identify potential for misuse of computer science to perpetuate social injustices, and their awareness of their agency to change those injustices. It will include classes like CS310F Ethical Foundations in Computer Science, CS349 Contemporary Issues in Computer Science, and CS173G, a Social Impact capstone that will be offered in 2023. While it might take a while before ethical education is standardized within the CS curriculum, it is important to recognize and appreciate the effort that students and professors alike are taking to promote a more inclusive and understanding environment for CS students to learn to be better people as well as better scientists.

    "text_content": "Advances in Batch Arguments Reduce Verification Costs | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Advances in Batch Arguments Reduce Verification Costs Posted by Rylie Lillibridge on Friday, March 3, 2023 A methodology developed by UT professors will allow the cost of verifying computations to be reduced by batching many separate arguments together. Brent Waters , a computer science professor and a co-author of the paper, was inspired to find a more efficient way to verify computations by refining techniques that had already come out over a decade ago. Recent advancements in constructing batch arguments together have relied on tools such as probabilistically checkable proofs or correlation-intractable hash functions. Although these tools are effective, they are computationally intensive. \u201cSometimes I get motivated by simplicity,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThere's different goals in computer science \u2026 just having a simpler or more sensible way of doing something can also be a goal.\u201d Waters, along with David Wu , a computer science professor and co-author of the study , developed a method to batch arguments by using a new type of proof system. Arguments are verified when a prover uses witnesses to convince the verifier that a batch of statements is correct. When arguments are batched together, multiple statements can be checked at the same time, cutting down on verification costs. Through this method, Wu said that verifying a full computation corresponds to batch verifying the proofs for each step of the computation. The method of batching arguments can be applied to NP statements, which are statements that are able to be easily verified when an algorithm is given a specific solution to a problem. \u201cThis does not mean that there is necessarily an efficient algorithm that actually allows you to find a solution to the problem, it only says that checking the solution to a problem can be done efficiently,\u201d Wu said. Wu said that batching arguments can help with delegation and outsourcing of computation, such as when information is sent to and from the cloud. \u201cCryptographic tools allow us to \u2026 check that the cloud is actually doing the correct computation,\u201c Wu said. \u201cThis is interesting because the cost of checking the computation is much, much smaller than the cost of performing the computation itself.\u201d Waters said that in the future, the methodology could be expanded to different computational assumptions outside of bilinear maps, as well as used for more practical issues. \u201cCan we take some of the ideas we had from (the methodology) and translate it to a kind of a different problem in cryptography, not about proofs?\u201d said Waters.  \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve been building \u2026 a certain type of new encryption systems where the problem itself doesn't seem to be particularly related to the batch, but some of the ideas translate over.\u201d News Categories Research Tags Brent Waters David Wu batch arguments Security & Privacy",

Press , a computer scientist and computational biologist at The University of Texas at Austin, will provide scientific perspective to the White House, as a recently named member of President Biden's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ). Press previously served President Obama as vice chair of PCAST from 2009 to 2017 and, apart from full-time Biden science advisor Eric Lander, he is the only former council member to be asked to serve by both presidents. Press, the Leslie Surginer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology, was among 30 scientists and engineers named to the council by President Biden today . PCAST members advise the president and vice president in the many areas where understanding of science, technology and innovation is key to forming responsible and effective policy. President Biden has identified five priority areas for the council: the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, technological and industrial competitiveness, equitable distribution of the benefits of science and technology, and the long-term health of science and technology. \"I am pleased and honored to be asked to serve,\" Press said, \"including being recalled to service in this way, which is an additional distinction.\" A member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and its elected Treasurer since 2016, Press has published more than 175 papers in the areas of computational biology, theoretical astrophysics, cosmology and computational algorithms. He is senior author of the \"Numerical Recipes\" textbooks on scientific computing, with more than 400,000 hardcover copies in print. His current research is in computational biology, genomics and computational statistical methods. At UT Austin, Press is affiliated with the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences . He is also a senior fellow emeritus at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in Los Alamos, N.M., a member of the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas since 2007, a past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the National Research Council Governing Board since 2016. He received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1973, where he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Kip Thorne. For more than 20 years, he was a professor of physics and astronomy at Harvard University, making significant contributions to the study of galaxies, black holes and supernovae. Then for six years, he served as deputy laboratory director at LANL before moving to UT Austin in 2007, where he shifted his research focus to computational biology. \"They [PCAST] are the ones asking the most American of questions: What next? How can we make the impossible possible?\" They are asking these questions as a call to action, to inspire, to help us imagine the future and to figure out how to make it real and improve the lives of the American people and people around the world,\" President Biden said. Drawing from the nation's most talented and accomplished individuals, President Biden's PCAST consists of 30 members, including 20 elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, five MacArthur \"Genius\" Fellows, two former Cabinet secretaries, and two Nobel laureates. Its members include experts in astrophysics and agriculture, biochemistry and computer engineering, ecology and entrepreneurship, immunology and nanotechnology, neuroscience and national security, social science and cybersecurity, and more. Two Texans will be among the members of PCAST; the other being Marvin Adams , a professor of nuclear engineering and associate director of the Institute for National Security and Cybersecurity Education & Research at Texas A&M University.

Traditionally, floorplans have been created by actually observing a 3D environment either manually or with the aid of 3D sensors. But what happens when the luxury of observing the 3D environment isn\u2019t available\u2014for example, when a robot is introduced to a new environment? Would it be able to quickly create floor maps without actually seeing the entire environment being mapped in detail? This is the exact question UT Computer Science Professor Kristen Grauman in conjunction with CMU PhD student Senthil Purushwalkam, among other researchers, explore how sound together with sight can be used to create accurate 2D floor plans without physically seeing the entire environment in \u201c Audio-Visual Floorplan Reconstruction .\u201d It aims to show how their newly introduced machine learning model, called AV-Map, can create accurate floor maps from a short video. Professor Grauman\u2019s research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, specializing in visual recognition and embodied perception. This background led her to be involved in research to determine how sound and sight could be used to interpret the 3D world. The AV-Map model brings together both sensing modalities to rapidly infer even parts of the environment not visible to the camera. This model is able to work because observed sound is inherently driven by geometry. As audio bounces around in a room it reveals the different shapes and objects in the room, even those that can\u2019t be directly seen. Additionally, the research shows how sound can also be used to reveal possible room layouts, for instance, the sound of a shower indicates a bathroom. The AV-Map model utilizes both passive environment-generated sound and active sound emitted by the camera to generate a floor plan. As an agent moves throughout an environment, it emits a sound that the model uses to estimate room layout as the sound bounces off walls. Based on results from 85 real-world multi-room environments, the AV-Map model consistently outperformed vision-based mapping. With just a few glimpses spanning 26% of an area, the model can estimate a floor plan layout with 66% accuracy. This type of technology has immense implications for the future of robotics. In certain situations, robots do not have the luxury of scouring a certain area to figure out the layout, the introduction of the AV model would give robots the ability to quickly survey their environment and figure out how to move around. The potential applications for the AV model are not limited to Robotics, however. \u201cWe come at it from the field of computer vision,\u201d Dr.Grauman says, \u201cand finding ways to advance what can be done technically.\u201d News Categories Research Tags Kristen Grauman Computer Vision Machine Learning",

    "text_content": "As AI Becomes Ubiquitous, There are Risks, Says New AI100 Report | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content As AI Becomes Ubiquitous, There are Risks, Says New AI100 Report Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, September 16, 2021 Artificial intelligence has reached a critical turning point in its evolution, according to a new report by an international panel of experts assessing the state of the field for the second time in five years. Substantial advances in language processing, computer vision and pattern recognition mean that AI is touching people's lives on a daily basis \u2014 from helping people to choose a movie to aiding in medical diagnoses. With that success, however, comes a renewed urgency to understand and mitigate the risks and downsides of AI-driven systems, such as algorithmic discrimination or use of AI for deliberate deception. Computer scientists must work with experts in the social sciences and law to assure that the pitfalls of AI are minimized. Those conclusions are from a report titled \" Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms: The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) 2021 Study Panel Report ,\" which was compiled by a panel of experts from computer science, public policy, psychology, sociology and other disciplines participating in AI100 . The AI100 standing committee is chaired by Peter Stone, a professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, executive director of Sony AI America and a key author and panel chair for an earlier report from the committee that assessed developments in AI five years ago. \"While many reports have been written about the impact of AI over the past several years, the AI100 reports are unique in that they are both written by AI insiders \u2014 experts who create AI algorithms or study their influence on society as their main professional activity \u2014 and that they are part of an ongoing, longitudinal, century-long study,\" Stone said. \"The 2021 report is critical to this longitudinal aspect of AI100 in that it links closely with the 2016 report by commenting on what's changed in the intervening five years. It also provides a wonderful template for future study panels to emulate by answering a set of questions that we expect future study panels to reevaluate at five-year intervals.\" AI100 is an ongoing project hosted by the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence that aims to monitor the progress of AI and guide its future development. Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University, chaired the panel for the new report. \"In the past five years, AI has made the leap from something that mostly happens in research labs or other highly controlled settings to something that's out in society affecting people's lives,\" Littman said. \"That's really exciting, because this technology is doing some amazing things that we could only dream about five or 10 years ago. But at the same time, the field is coming to grips with the societal impact of this technology, and I think the next frontier is thinking about ways we can get the benefits from AI while minimizing the risks.\" The report, released on Thursday, Sept. 16, is structured to answer a set of 14 questions probing critical areas of AI development. The questions were developed by the AI100 standing committee consisting of a renowned group of AI leaders. The committee then assembled a panel of 17 researchers and experts to answer them. The questions include \"What are the most important advances in AI?\" and \"What are the most inspiring open grand challenges?\" Other questions address the major risks and dangers of AI, its effects on society, its public perception and the future of the field. In terms of AI advances, the panel noted substantial progress across subfields of AI, including speech and language processing, computer vision and other areas. Much of this progress has been driven by advances in machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning systems, which have made the leap in recent years from the academic setting to everyday applications. Some of the risks and dangers cited in the report stem from deliberate misuse of AI \u2014 deepfake images and video used to spread misinformation or harm people's reputations, or online bots used to manipulate public discourse and opinion. Other dangers stem from \"an aura of neutrality and impartiality associated with AI decision-making in some corners of the public consciousness, resulting in systems being accepted as objective even though they may be the result of biased historical decisions or even blatant discrimination,\" the panel writes. This is a particular concern in areas like law enforcement, where crime prediction systems have been shown to adversely affect communities of color, or in health care, where embedded racial bias in insurance algorithms can affect people's access to appropriate care. As the use of AI increases, these kinds of problems are likely to become more widespread. The good news, Littman said, is that the field is taking these dangers seriously and actively seeking input from experts in psychology, public policy and other fields to explore ways of mitigating them. At UT Austin, for example, a grand challenge research effort called Good Systems , with which Stone is involved, seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society, and affiliated researchers recently won support from the National Science Foundation to integrate ethics into more educational offerings related to developing AI systems, particularly robotics. Moving forward, the panel concludes that governments, academia and industry will need to play expanded roles in making sure AI evolves to serve the greater good.

UT Computer Science Undergraduate Program ranked No. 10 nationally , with five top-10 specialty rankings: # 6 in Programming Languages # 6 in Software Engineering # 9 in Artificial Intelligence # 9 in Computer Systems # 10 in Theory Among U.S. public universities, UT Austin now ranks No. 10, up three spots from last year, and remains the top public university in Texas. The University of Texas at Austin rose to No. 38 among national universities in U.S. News & World Report's latest undergraduate rankings, climbing four spots since last year. The U.S. News ranking is one of the most widely referenced measurements of undergraduate programs and is based on 12 weighted factors. Contributing to the university's higher ranking this year were high reputational scores and increases in six-year graduation rates, first-year retention rates, and faculty resources. UT Austin has again ranked the top university in Texas for veterans and No. 16 nationally. The university also ranked in the top 25 in two specialty categories, placing No. 19 among the country's Most Innovative Schools and No. 25 nationally for undergraduate research. \"This is ultimately a story about UT's trajectory. We continue to move ahead in many ways, improving our position among elite universities,\" said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \"We're not done yet, and our future is very bright, even while we appreciate the recognition of our progress these rankings represent.

Allen Emerson /UTCS Faculty and Turing Award Winner 5:45 \u2013 7:30 Reception for invited guests About Dr. Emerson Image Bio: Dr. Emerson is Regents Chair and Professor in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. Emerson works in formal methods for verifying and debugging programs, and is co-founder of the successful field of model checking for automatically verifying correctness of nominally finite state systems. In recognition of this achievement, Emerson is a recipient of the 2007 ACM Turing Award. Emerson is also a recipient of the ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for the invention of symbolic model checking, and the 2006 IEEE Logic in Computer Science Test-of-Time Award for contributions to logics of programs. Emerson serves on the editorial boards of major formal methods journals including Formal Methods in Systems Design and Formal Aspects of Computing. He also serves on the Steering Committees of the Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI) Conference as well as the Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis (ATVA) Conference. Dr. Emerson received his BS in mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin and his PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard University. ACM Turing Award Honors Founders of Automatic Verification Technology That Enables Faster, More Reliable Designs NEW YORK, February 4, 2008 - ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, has named Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis the winners of the 2007 A.M. Turing Award, widely considered the most prestigious award in computing, for their original and continuing research in a quality assurance process known as Model Checking. Their innovations transformed this approach from a theoretical technique to a highly effective verification technology that enables computer hardware and software engineers to find errors efficiently in complex system designs. This transformation has resulted in increased assurance that the systems perform as intended by the designers. Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis developed this fully automated approach that is now the most widely used verification method in the hardware and software industries. ACM President Stuart Feldman said the work of Clarke, Emerson and Sifakis has had a major impact on designers and manufacturers of semiconductor chips. \"These industries face a technology explosion in which products of unprecedented complexity have to operate as expected for companies to survive. This verification advance enabled these industries to shorten time to market and increase product integrity. Without the conceptual breakthrough pioneered by these researchers, we might still be stuck with chips that have many errors and would lack the power and speed of today's equipment. This is a great example of an industry-transforming technology arising from highly theoretical research,\" Feldman said. Citation In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of Model Checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model--representing, for example, a hardware or software design--satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem. The progression of Model Checking to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past 27 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a result many major hardware and software companies are now using Model Checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits, communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms. The work of Drs. Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms, and surprising theoretical results. Model Checking tools, created by both academic and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance regarding the correctness of their initial designs. About the A.M. Turing Award The A.M. Turing Award was named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, and who was a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher during World War II. Since its inception in 1966, the Turing Award has honored the computer scientists and engineers who created the systems and underlying theoretical foundations that have propelled the information technology industry. The Turing Award is considered the most prestigious award in computer science. It carries a $250,000 cash prize. The Turing Award is widely viewed as the \"Nobel Prize\" of computer science.

    "text_content": "Graduating Computer Science Student Leaders Look Back on Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Graduating Computer Science Student Leaders Look Back on Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, May 21, 2021 Computer science seniors Am\u00e9rica Quistiano and Audra Collins said they would not be here, on the cusp of graduating from one of the best computer science programs in the country, without the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists and the Association of Black Computer Scientists . \"I 100% believe I would have dropped out,\" Quistiano said. \"I wouldn't have switched majors, not even switched schools \u2014 I would have dropped out if it weren't for HACS and ABCS.\" Neither Collins nor Quistiano had any computer science experience before college, but these organizations helped them find their footing at UT Austin. Quistiano said ABCS and HACS host professional, academic and social events, but they also provide a space to discuss their struggles. Both students are also actively involved with other organizations for minority computer science students, like Q++ , for LGBTQ+ students, and Women in Computer Science . Quistiano is HACS' president, and Collins is ABCS' president \u2014 they both received an Aspire Award, recognizing them for their achievements in research, service and leadership. \"I would not be here without those organizations, and I would not be as confident as I am with myself and my abilities without that community,\" Collins said. Black and Hispanic/Latinx students have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields, including computer science, and in the Department of Computer Science . \"I'm a first generation Latina student, I really didn't know about this whole college thing,\" Quistiano said. \"I just searched for the best computer science schools, and UT was one of the top results\u2026 But I didn't really have anyone to ask about the process.\" After graduation, both Quistiano and Collins will work as software engineers for Microsoft in Seattle. They're even working in the same building, which Quistiano called a \"huge coincidence.\" \"Sometimes I like to think Am\u00e9rica and I share part of our brains,\" Collins said. Working Together Last summer, after noticing that there wasn't a scholarship specifically for Black or Latinx students that was run and funded by the computer science department, Collins and Quistiano wanted to create one. At the same time, the department was planning initiatives that aimed to alleviate the financial burden of studying computer science. The result of these efforts by students and staff is the Texas Computer Science Endowment for Change . Quistiano said incoming and current HACS and ABCS members, as well as students who have participated in the Academy for All program , are eligible to receive the award. \"Our original fundraising goal was $25,000, but we raised $41,000 for the endowment during a virtual semester,\" Quistiano said. \"We created the scholarship at the beginning of last fall, some awards were given this spring, and more awards will be rolled out in the fall 2021 semester.\" Collins and Quistiano also helped organize a bootcamp for younger Black and Latinx students in the department. They delved into a variety of topics, including choosing classes, the career paths available to them, building their brand, finding internships and succeeding in those internships. \"We were hitting so many points on how to help students,\" Quistiano said. \"It was really a day of passing down knowledge, tips and tricks and specific encouragement.\" This month, Collins and Quistiano also organized a roundtable discussion about diversity and inclusion in the computer science department with students, staff and faculty, including department chair Don Fussell. Quistiano said the main part of the event consisted of students sharing their concerns and hardships, and the computer science leadership actively listening to them. \"As a Black woman in computer science, I experience these issues every day, but I have to remember that there are people within the department who just don't know what it's like,\" Collins said. \"I'm proud of the roundtable because it's changing the culture of the department, it's allowing staff members and faculty members to walk away and start conversations on their own about the issues that affect us.

He grew up watching Longhorn football legend Earl Campbell play at a young age and recalls being a die-hard Longhorn ever since. When the time for undergraduate decisions came around, he declined scholarship offers from other colleges and chose to only apply to UT Austin because it was \u201cthe only university he wanted to go to.\u201d He was originally undecided on a major but chose to pursue a computer science degree after his friend urged him to follow his passion for computers. One of the most influential experiences that Ron had in his life was taking an introduction to artificial intelligence course during the last semester of his undergrad which was pivotal to his life\u2019s path. He had six hours left to complete his degree so he took the AI class serendipitously as an elective. \u201cIt's not an exaggeration to say that course opened my eyes to the world of artificial intelligence and what possibilities existed there. I can't even imagine how different my life would be had I not taken that one course.\u201d Before taking the course, he was aware that AI existed but imagined it was something only done in secret research labs or needed billions of dollars of government backing. AI seemed out of reach and not realistic. \u201cWhen I was at UT and I took that AI course, it was critical. It not only made me aware that it was something that I could do, but that the field was still very new and that there were huge opportunities to make a meaningful impact in that world. So much was still unknown at that point. I went from being curious in a fun elective to being obsessed when I finished the course.\u201d He obtained his CS bachelor\u2019s from UT in 1992 and, after being inspired by the AI course, he went on to pursue a master\u2019s degree in Evolutionary Adaptive Systems at The University of Sussex. \u201cIt was essentially artificial intelligence,\u201d Green noted. In the 1990s, programs wanted to avoid using the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d to distance themselves from the perceived unmet promises of AI at the time. \u201cThere was a bit of a sense of AI not living up to the hype.\u201d Of course, AI was just getting started and it would become what his life\u2019s work centered around for the next 30 years. \u201cIt's really crazy. I consider myself deeply lucky for going into a field that was this interesting and ambitious and live to see it mature. You don't always get that chance.\u201d Ron describes himself as \u201ca serial tech entrepreneur\u201d because of his longtime work with startups. He\u2019s founded several different AI startups and finds there\u2019s almost nothing more fun than having all the options open to him in the days of a startup\u2019s inception. Now, he\u2019s spent the last three years at KUNGFU.AI as a co-founder and CTO. At KUNGFU.AI, he works to democratize artificial intelligence and machine learning. His goal is to help companies build custom AI solutions that deliver business value and go into production usage. He also puts effort into ensuring his clients know the benefits of AI and dispelling myths about the technology. \u201cThe vast majority of companies in the world have not even begun to understand, let alone utilize these new capabilities in AI. The intimidation factor is very real. My hope is that over the next few years we can play at least a small role in helping to democratize AI because technology distribution can be pretty inequitable. And there are real dangers in AI like training data bias. We are deeply committed to making sure all the things that we do embrace our sense of AI for good. We want to build AI systems that make the world better. And if it's not going to make the world better, quite frankly, we\u2019re not interested.\u201d When he\u2019s not working at KUNGFU.AI, Ron is mentoring at Capital Factory in downtown Austin focusing on startups, entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence. Here, he helps rising entrepreneurs get started with free advice and consultations to advance their potential within the field of AI. He wakes up every day excited about the growth and improvement happening in artificial intelligence. \u201cWe are seeing improvements in computer vision and natural language processing almost on a daily basis. We\u2019ve just begun to scratch the surface.\u201d And it all traces back to a single AI course he took for fun. What started at UT definitely changed his world and allowed him to change others\u2019 worlds. News Categories Alumni Tags startups Artificial Intelligence entrepreneurship AI",

The competition consisted of 50 teams of 3 students from 50 schools across the US and Canada. UT Austin solved 6 of the 13 problems and came in 13th . The three students are Dejia Xu (ECE Ph.D. student), Jiawei Li (CS Ph.D. student), and Ruoshi Dai (CS MS student), and they will compete again at the ICPC World Finals in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt in Nov 2023. UT has been competing in ICPC since 1997. In the last six years, Egypt will be UT's fifth appearance at the world finals. UT went to the 2019 world finals in Moscow, the 2018 world finals in Portugal, the 2017 world finals in Beijing, and the 2016 world finals in South Dakota. They also advanced five additional times between 1997 and 2009. UT has seen marked improvement since the creation of a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming in 2014, taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing and the student officers of the UT Programming Contest . Citadel LLC has sponsored the UTPC training and outreach activities since 2018. The ICPC traces its roots to 1970, when the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society hosted the first competition. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to increase the most vital students' ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities in computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition, with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the tournament has expanded into a worldwide collaboration of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition for universities worldwide. The ICPC is part of the ICPC Foundation. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The competition has raised the aspirations and performance of generations of the world's problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering.

    "text_content": "Aaronson Receives ACM Prize in Computing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Aaronson Receives ACM Prize in Computing Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, April 14, 2021 The Association for Computing Machinery has awarded Scott Aaronson the 2020 ACM Prize in Computing for groundbreaking contributions to quantum computing. Aaronson is the David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. The goal of quantum computing is to harness the laws of quantum physics to build devices that can solve problems that classical computers either cannot solve at all or would take even supercomputers tens of thousands of years to solve. Aaronson showed how results from computational complexity theory can provide new insights into the laws of quantum physics. His research has brought clarity to what quantum computers will, and will not, be able to do. Aaronson helped develop the concept of quantum supremacy, the milestone at which a quantum device can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in a reasonable amount of time. Aaronson established many of the theoretical foundations of quantum supremacy experiments. Such experiments allow scientists to give convincing evidence that quantum computers provide exponential speedups without having to first build a full fault-tolerant quantum computer. The ACM Prize in Computing recognizes computer scientists whose research contributions have fundamental impact and broad implications, exemplifying the greatest achievements in the discipline. The award, previously known as the ACM-Infosys Foundation Award in the Computing Sciences (from 2007 through 2015), is one of the most prestigious a computer scientist can receive and carries a prize of $250,000, from an endowment provided by Infosys Ltd. A graduate of Cornell University, Aaronson earned a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. His honors include the Tomassoni-Chisesi Prize in Physics (2018), a Simons Investigator Award (2017) and the Alan T. Waterman Award of the National Science Foundation (2012). Beyond his technical contributions, Aaronson has become recognized as a leading spokesperson for the field. He maintains a popular blog, Shtetl Optimized , where he explains timely and exciting topics in quantum computing. He also authored Quantum Computing Since Democritus , a highly respected book on quantum computing. He also has written several articles for popular science audiences, and he presented a TED Talk at TEDxDresden to dispel misconceptions and provide the public with a more accurate overview of the field. \"Few areas of technology have as much potential as quantum computation,\" said ACM President Gabriele Kotsis. \"Despite being at a relatively early stage in his career, Scott Aaronson is esteemed by his colleagues for the breadth and depth of his contributions. He has helped guide the development of this new field, while clarifying its possibilities as a leading educator and superb communicator. Importantly, his contributions have not been confined to quantum computation, but have had significant impact in areas such as computational complexity theory and physics.\" News Categories Awards & Honors Press Release Tags NSF CAREER Award Scott Aaronson",

Photo by Iris Li Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, small businesses have struggled to stay afloat. Because of this, Rashu Jain, a business honors, finance and math junior, and Niti Malwade, a business honors and computer science junior, came up with a way to help and to give back to local business owners \u2014 through storytelling. Inspired by the popular photoblog Humans of New York, where residents share their personal stories, Jain and Malwade started Stories of Austin \u2014 a storytelling platform on Instagram and Facebook that highlights the stories of small-business owners. Their goal was to focus on the passion and resilience displayed by local owners rather than on products and services. \u201cWe thought this would be a great way for the Austin community to feel connected to the small-business community and then hopefully go and support them,\u201d Malwade said. The pair spent the summer reaching out to over 30 business owners and conducting interviews over Zoom, growing more inspired by each story they heard. As they posted photos and stories to the Stories of Austin social media accounts, they began receiving an abundance of positive feedback from friends and followers alike. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times where people message us saying: \u2018Oh, I read your story. I\u2019m going to go to this restaurant. What do you recommend?\u2019,\u201d Malwade said. \u201cOr they\u2019ll say, \u2018I didn\u2019t even know this store existed,\u2019 or \u2018I had no idea this business had such a cool story.\u2019 So just hearing these anecdotal testaments has been really touching to hear.\u201d In the fall, Jain and Malwade expanded on their idea while taking the Women in Entrepreneurship course through the Kendra Scott Women\u2019s Entrepreneurial Leadership Institute . In the class, they formed a five-person team and spent the semester conducting research and establishing plans for their business, including a revenue model. The course, co-taught by professors of practice and entrepreneurs Jan Ryan and Kendra Scott , provides hands-on, tangible tools to equip and empower female entrepreneurs. During the course, the team was given the opportunity to pitch their idea to the Kendra Scott executive team and members of the greater Austin entrepreneurial community. They say the assistance, feedback and mentorship provided through this course have been pivotal and monumental to the growth of their startup. Other organizations that have made a significant impact on their entrepreneurial journey are Genesis , a student-alumni partnership that provides student startups with equity-free funding to pursue their ventures, and the Social Entrepreneurship Learning Lab (SELL) Fellowship program, which assists UT undergraduate students in building social impact-focused organizations. The pair cites the UT community as one of the biggest inspirations on their entrepreneurial journey thus far. \u201cJust being surrounded by a lot of people that are extremely motivated, hardworking and generous with their time and their advice has also been very helpful,\u201d Malwade said. \u201cHaving peers that we can bounce ideas off of and get help from has been really great.\u201d Brainstorming ideas on how their platform can benefit the Austin community is something Jain and Malwade are consistently doing, and they were able to put some of those ideas into practice during the recent \u201cWinter Storm Uri.\u201d When students in West Campus were left without electricity due to citywide outages, the pair reached out to their small-business connections, sponsors and growing social media following to fund 632 meals for UT students in need, in collaboration with the SELL Fellowship program. To Jain, this passion project turned business venture is more than just a business; it\u2019s personal. \u201cI\u2019m from a town where it\u2019s very franchised, and there\u2019s not a lot of local things. The small-business culture is what I really love about Austin and a reason why I\u2019d like to stay here in the future as well,\u201d she said. Malwade, an Austin native, says that for her, getting to learn the backstories of small businesses that she has frequented her entire life has been eye-opening and rewarding. \u201cA trend that I\u2019ve picked up on is how hard it really is to be a small-business owner and an entrepreneur,\u201d she said. \u201cAs an owner, you have to take care of everything, including finances, marketing, social media, sales and more. I didn\u2019t think about that before we started doing these interviews. It\u2019s been really humbling to hear stories about the amount of hard work it takes.\u201d So what are their hopes for the future of Stories of Austin? \u201cFor both of us, the ideal future would consist of people walking by a business and checking the story on our platform,\u201d Jain said. \u201cWe want Stories of Austin to become a household name and give people the chance to really connect with the local community because of the power of storytelling.\u201d This article originally appeared on the UT News webpage.

    "text_content": "UT Scientists Use AI to Find Tourist Movement Patterns in Cuzco, Peru | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Scientists Use AI to Find Tourist Movement Patterns in Cuzco, Peru Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Wednesday, October 28, 2020 We live in an increasingly digital era. Research shows that the average American checks their phone about 58 times daily, and spends an average of 4.5 hours a day on their phone. Without a doubt the amount of time the modern-day person spends on their phones has changed many aspects of how our society functions. For example, in the past decade we have seen a dramatic shift in forms of advertising. Companies are able to take note of people's patterns online and create personalized ads through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Similar to the advertising sphere, the internet age has brought great transformation to how researchers study human patterns and how humans interact with the environment. Our heavy usage of technology and social media has given researchers more access to our data, while advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning enables researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this data more efficiently than ever before. It is precisely these two aspects of modern life that shaped the research of The University of Texas at Austin computer scientists Professor Kristen Grauman and Wei-Lin Hsiao and anthropologists Professor R. Alan Covey and Nicole D. Payntar . In their research article entitled \u201cLearning Patterns of Tourist Movement and Photography from Geotagged Photos at Archaeological Heritage Sites in Cuzco, Peru\u201d , these UT Austin researchers set out to understand how the increase of tourism and social media intersects with heritage regulations to aid in the creation of travel patterns across Cuzco's heritage landscape. Additionally, they embarked to study and document how social media has affected tourists\u2019 aesthetic preferences and expectations. Tourism in Cuzco, Peru, the former capital of the Incan empire, began in the early 1900s following an expedition by Hiram Bingham. By the 1920s government officials realized the economic potential of tourism in Cuzco and began funding the restoration of regional archaeological sites for tourism. Since then tourism in Cuzco has taken off. Today annual visits in the region top 3 million with heritage tourism, tourism that involves traveling to places of cultural significance, being a major draw. By the late 70s, tourist initiatives were being created to promote and popularize tourism in Cuzco's prominent archaeological sites including the creation of the original Boleto Turistico (BTC) tourist package in 1978 and the promotion of the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. Over time these initiatives included packaged day-trip itineraries to some Cuzco's more remote archaeological sites. In their research, Nicole D. Payntar, Wei-Lin Hsiao, R. Alan Covey, and Kristen Grauman collected 57,804 images from community internet photos shared on social media sites captured across 12 archaeological sites in the Cuzco region. Through the use of geo-tagging technology, they were able to detect patterns of tourist movement at these sites and analyze how they\u2019ve changed over time. AI technology also enabled them to categorize tourist images based on common themes such as mountains, stonework, alpaca, terracing, etc.. From this dataset spanning 2004-2019, these UT Austin researchers were able to bring to light some insightful patterns of tourists in Cuzco, Peru. They uncovered which sites were the most popular sites in the area, the least visited and which sites people spent the most time at. The data and geo-tagging technology also allowed them to be able to track tourist patterns and determine how tourists moved across these archaeological sites. Additionally, the researchers were able to determine which type of aesthetic tourists were capturing in their pictures at each site. These results led them to conclude that policies in the region have definitely affected how tourists interact with the sites. The introduction of the day passes influenced how tourists travel across the region, and conservation initiatives and regulations at larger tourist sites led to an increase in photo-homogeneity while smaller sites with less regulation had much more diverse pictures. The data also showed that the most popular pictures of the Cuzco region shared similar aesthetic qualities with the historic photographs published by Hiram Bingham in the early 20th Century. This shows that heritage aesthetics remain pretty similar over time due to the visual reproduction of what is meant to be seen based on perceived experiences and audience consumption. A study like this would not be possible if it were not for the rise of social media technologies, and innovations in AI, specifically applied computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Due to our increasing online presence, researchers are gaining access to more information about patterns in our lives than ever before. AI plays an equally important role as it allows researchers to categorize and identify patterns in this immense amount of data. \u201cThe project would have been impossible to complete without machine learning\u201d Nicole D. Payntar, lead author on this project, writes, \u201c... data extracted from photos using machine learning algorithms can inform sustainable development, maximize socio-economic policies, and provide cultural insights by expanding our understanding of how people experience place.\u201d News Categories Research Tags AI Artificial Intelligence Data Social media Machine Learning Algorithms",

An interdisciplinary team of researchers and students, including Texas Computer Science (TXCS) undergraduate students Rohit Neppali, Anshul Modh, Viren Velacheri, and Ph.D. student Anibal Heinsfeld, developed the Protect Texas Together app to help track and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on the Forty Acres. When asked about his motivation for joining the project, Heinsfled said that what appealed to him was \u201cthe possibility of providing a useful resource for our UT community in these difficult times, together with the challenge of developing a scalable and helpful platform ready for this fall.\u201d He added, \u201cwhat kept my enthusiasm was the constant mindset of data privacy: every feature needed to be scrutinized and tested to guarantee that the user data was reasonably private.\u201d Modh echoed this sentiment, stating that the developers wanted to design an app that would be beneficial without infrinign on user\u2019s privacy. \u201cOne of the long-term goals of this initiative is to enable research in the future from the anonymous data that we gather to help guide us in future pandemics if they arise. Our data-driven society is constantly adapting to solve new problems but with the increasing value and power that data holds in our modern world, the privacy and security risks grow,\u201d he said. The voluntary app is accessible to anyone with a UT EID and allows users to gain a comprehensive view of their symptoms and see who they have been in contact with. Features of the Protect Texas Together app include symptom surveys, contact tracing, and campus room check-ins, among others. The University of Texas\u2019 Whole Communities\u2013Whole Health grand challenge team helped design and lead the development process. Established in 2016, the group focuses on using technologies to improve the wellbeing of communities. From the website: \u201cOur communities are becoming increasingly diverse just as we have developed the unprecedented technological ability to study health and human behavior. The things we can learn and the ways we can use that knowledge to help people thrive are revolutionary.\u201d Protect Texas Together is one of many methods the university is using to help minimize the risk of catching COVID-19 on campus. The university is also implementing social distancing guidelines, reducing building capacities, and face mask policies. To read more about the app, check out the stories on UT News and KXAN .

    "text_content": "TXCS Alumnus Greg Kuhlmann Aims to Help Others Succeed by Making Anti-Fraud Systems More Accessible | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TXCS Alumnus Greg Kuhlmann Aims to Help Others Succeed by Making Anti-Fraud Systems More Accessible Posted by Valeria Sixtos on Tuesday, December 1, 2020 Alumnus Greg Kuhlmann was introduced to computers and programming by his family at a young age. During Kuhlmann\u2019s childhood, his grandfather taught him how to program on his VIC-20 when he was just six years old and his father would take him to Amiga Users Group meetings. The ability offered by programming to change bits of code and see a new outcome right before his eyes was what really drew Kuhlmann in. Unbeknownst to him, he would go on to earn a graduate degree in computer science and start his own cybersecurity startup. During his undergraduate studies at UCLA, Kuhlmann became particularly interested in artificial intelligence, automated theorem, and areas of math which he had never encountered before. This solidified the decision to continue his studies at The University of Texas at Austin, which was spurred on by the Department of Computer Science\u2019s national ranking and the fact that he \u201ccompletely fell in love\u201d with Austin\u2019s lush and green cityscape. As a graduate student, Kuhlmann worked with Vladimir Lifschitz in his first year and then with Peter Stone for the remainder of his time at UT. Kuhlmann worked as a lead scientist for 21st Century Technologies, where he applied machine learning and intelligent agent techniques to unmanned systems and data mining problems. While pursuing his PhD at UT, Kuhlmann was also involved with the Austin Villa Robot Soccer Team which he has fond memories of. He recalls the long nights spent working on the robots and the solidarity between him and his teammates that arose from them. \u201cAt two o'clock in the morning, you finally get it to work and you just feel such a bond with your fellow teammates that you've been working on this thing together. Nothing brings people together more than this sort of common struggle.\u201d The idea of helping individuals remained a driving point in Kuhlmann\u2019s life upon receiving his PhD. He worked as a data scientist at Apple for 9 years where the importance of both personal and professional connections was solidified for him. \u201cYou're helping these millions of people, you're saving this company millions of dollars, you're bringing a better customer experience to hundreds of millions of people, and those numbers just feel too abstract,\u201d Kuhlmann said. He says that the thing that brought him the most satisfaction was being able to help people \u2013 not just the big companies and corporations. \u201cI realized that the thing I contributed that day made their life a little bit easier,\u201d Kuhlmann said. Now, Kuhlmann is the Co-Founder and CEO of Sumatra, his Austin based self-funded startup that provides \u201cAnti-Fraud and Trust & Safety as a Service.\u201d He was inspired to start his company after realizing that sophisticated anti-fraud systems used at big companies like Uber, Apple, and Facebook aren\u2019t widely available to smaller companies that could benefit just as much from them. He saw those big companies go to conferences and talk about their sophisticated anti-fraud systems. \u201cBut none of these systems are actually available more widely. You realize that most of what is going on out there in the world is not just those big players,\u201d Kuhlmann said. He decided to step in and help bridge that gap. At his startup, Kuhlmann is able to continue utilizing both the teamwork and technical skills he was able to hone during his time at TXCS. His expertise in data science and operations help companies at the next tier avoid \u201cscammers, bullying, harassment, and all the different kinds of things that can happen in [an] ecosystem that makes for a bad customer experience.\u201d His vision is to work with his team to assist these smaller companies succeed at a level that is traditionally reserved for the big names in tech. His passion for helping people and smaller companies at a closer level continues to thrive within his vision for a future in which anti-fraud systems are more widely available and accessible. Currently, his team is working to build the tools that will aid smaller companies to avoid fraud \u2013 with an emphasis on anti-fraud education and instruction. The team realized that these tools are only as effective as people knowing how to use them. \u201cNow we're at this point moving forward and we're adding a new element to it, which is the training part of it as well. So to really democratize this idea of trust and safety, data science, we need both better tooling and better training. And that's what we're trying to bring together now,\u201d Kuhlmann said.  As for what the future holds, Kuhlmann plans on doing what he is passionate about for as long as possible. In true data scientist wording, he wants to make sure he\u2019s doing whatever he\u2019s  doing \u201c1% better every day and then taking advantage of the compound interest of that.\u201d Whether it is at a personal level or at a corporate level, Kuhlmann wants to help the people and projects he cares about to succeed.

    "text_content": "UTCS Alum Tarun Nimmagadda: A Self-Starter in Mission-driven Entrepreneurship | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UTCS Alum Tarun Nimmagadda: A Self-Starter in Mission-driven Entrepreneurship Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Monday, April 19, 2021 Tarun Nimmagada Graduated the from UT Computer Science with a bachelor's in 2009. He was accepted to the Turings Scholar program , a computer science honor program that requires students to complete an honors thesis before graduating. This program introduced Tarun to computer science research from an early point in his computer science career. With this research background, Tarun entered a competition in his junior year offering a hefty $50,000 reward for anyone who could come up with a business idea with a positive social impact. Inspired, he came up with an idea to build technology that assists people with disabilities to move  around campus. He submitted his idea to the competition, built a team, and won. Since then, Tarun knew that mission-driven entrepreneurship was the path for him. Though Tarun graduated from UT Computer Science with hopes of starting his own company, he graduated at the height of the 2008 recession\u2014not the ideal moment to launch a startup. At this time, however,  iPhones entered the scene, opening up an opportunity for the recent computer science graduate. Tarun decided to use his education and research experience to build apps for smartphones. He started a company called Mutual Mobile to build iPhone apps for other companies. The company grew rapidly, and within four years the company had about 350 employees before it was acquired. Tarun then started a company called Ruckit in construction tech, which was also acquired recently in December 2020. More recently, Tarun has been using his entrepreneurship mindset and skill as a computer scientist to help the world deal with the impact of COVID-19. When the pandemic first started, Tarun put out a post on social media saying that he wanted to build technology to help fight the pandemic. Immediately, he got several responses from his peers. They decided that they could have the most impact by helping  companies keep track of the health of their employees. They worked together to create this solution, and they named it ReturnSafe. ReturnSafe is helping organizations and businesses reopen and stay open by protecting workers and families from infectious disease outbreaks in the workplace. The company\u2019s holistic software solution provides daily health screenings, testing data management, exposure notification and contact tracing solutions, and vaccine and case management for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The goal is to ensure businesses can transition confidently between now, the post-COVID world, and beyond. So far, ReturnSafe employs 30 people, is used by 50 companies and has generated over a million dollars worth of revenue. Ultimately, entrepreneurship is about changing the world. Entrepreneurs seek problems in our society and then create a solution for them, and Tarun is no exception. For this reason, computer science and entrepreneurship go hand in hand, as Tarun put it \u201cComputer science is broad and applicable[and is] playing a leading role in increasing our understanding of the world.\u201d The opportunity to engage with computer science research from early on as a student has opened up many doors for Tarun and allowed him to utilize his problem-solving mindset to leave a positive impact on society. For Tarun, this is just the beginning, he has already been named in Inc\u2019s 30 Under 30, Forbes\u2019 50 Most Promising Companies, recognized by the White House as one of the top 100 companies founded by young entrepreneurs and sits on UT Computer Science\u2019s advisory council. \u201cI think i\u2019m just getting started,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI\u2019m sharpening the skills I need to make the kind of impact I want to have 10 years from now.\u201d News Categories Alumni Tags Alumni Tarun Nimmagadda COVID-19 entrepreneurship Advisory Council",

    "text_content": "TXCS Research Team Wins 2020 PointNav Challenge | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TXCS Research Team Wins 2020 PointNav Challenge Posted by Angela Schiff on Monday, August 31, 2020 A team comprising Texas Computer Science (TXCS) Ph.D. student Santhosh Ramakrishnan, postdoctoral researcher Ziad Al-Halah, and TXCS Professor Kristen Grauman recently won first place in the 2020 Habitat visual navigation challenge held at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). The event consisted of two challenges: ObjectNav, which required an agent to find a specific object in an unknown environment\u2014such as locating a fireplace in a room\u2014and PointNav, which required an agent to navigate to a target coordinate in an unknown environment. ObjectNav focused on recognizing objects and commonsense reasoning about object semantics, like knowing that a fireplace is typically located in the living room. PointNav, in comparison, focused on simulation realism and sim2real predictivity: the ability to predict a model's navigational performance when used by a real-robot by examining its performance in a simulation. The TXCS team won the PointNav side of the challenge. Several teams competed against each other as they tried to design a learning agent that can enter an unfamiliar environment and quickly learn how to navigate the space while performing an \u201cintelligent search to find a given location or object.\u201d Ramakrishnan, a third-year Ph.D. student, further explained the challenge: \u201c[the agent] doesn\u2019t have a map of the environment, it knows nothing about it. It\u2019s given [a coordinate] that it needs to get to very quickly, and success is measured by whether or not it reaches the point and how quickly it reaches the point.\u201d This challenge was serendipitous for Ramakrishnan, who has been working with Professor Grauman for three years and whose research is primarily focused on the intersection of computer vision and reinforcement learning. He worked on \u201c Occupancy Anticipation for Efficient Exploration and Navigation \u201d with the UT Austin Computer Vision Group before entering the challenge. As opposed to the typical approach in visual navigation, which focuses on building a map by documenting what the agent can see, the paper explores a different method: predicting the things that aren\u2019t immediately seen. Ramakrishnan explained the research in terms of a bedroom. When entering a bedroom, agents could easily perceive objects such as a floor or a bed. But what about objects under the bed, or behind it? \u201cIf I\u2019m entering a bedroom and I don\u2019t see everything behind the bed, I can still guess that there\u2019s going to be some amount of floor space behind the bed because I would have to get on it.\u201d This research helps autonomous agents navigate their environment more efficiently by predicting the unseen. The work was ideal for tackling the PointNav challenge. \u201cWe thought that we might try out the idea in this particular challenge because it fits well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was interesting to bridge the gap between work at the research level versus work that needs to function well at the level of competition. You\u2019re competing with people who are working on the same problem at the same time. In such an event, everyone is at their best. The most rewarding part [of entering the challenge] was pushing the boundaries of what a method can do and get the best performance that they could,\u201d Ramakrishnan said.

    "text_content": "UT Austin Selected as Home of National AI Institute Focused on Machine Learning | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Austin Selected as Home of National AI Institute Focused on Machine Learning Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, August 26, 2020 The National Science Foundation has selected The University of Texas at Austin to lead NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning, bolstering the university\u2019s existing strengths in this emerging field. Machine learning is the technology that drives AI systems, enabling them to acquire knowledge and make predictions in complex environments. This technology has the potential to transform everything from transportation to entertainment to health care. UT Austin \u2014 already among the world\u2019s top universities for artificial intelligence \u2014 is poised to develop entirely new classes of algorithms that will lead to more sophisticated and beneficial AI technologies. The university will lead a larger team of researchers that includes the University of Washington, Wichita State University and Microsoft Research. \u201cThis is another important step in our university\u2019s ascension as a world leader in machine learning and tech innovation as a whole, and I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for their profound support,\u201d said UT Austin interim President Jay Hartzell. \u201cMany of the world\u2019s greatest problems and challenges can be solved with the assistance of artificial intelligence, and it\u2019s only fitting, given UT\u2019s history of accomplishment in this area along with the booming tech sector in Austin, that this new NSF institute be housed right here on the Forty Acres.\u201d UT Austin is simultaneously establishing a permanent base for campuswide machine learning research called the Machine Learning Laboratory . It will house the new AI institute and bring together computer and data scientists, mathematicians, roboticists, engineers and ethicists to meet the institute\u2019s research goals while also working collaboratively on other interdisciplinary projects. Computer science professor Adam Klivans, who led the effort to win the NSF AI institute competition, will direct both the new institute and the Machine Learning Lab. Alex Dimakis, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, will serve as the AI institute\u2019s co-director. Machine learning enables machines to find patterns in large sets of data. Already, it powers many technologies we use every day such as web search engines, voice assistants, social media feeds and recommendation systems for music and movies. Now researchers are looking to apply machine learning to more complex problems and exploring how to design machine learning innovations that transform industries in ways that align with human needs . \u201cMachine learning can be used to predict which of thousands of recently formulated drugs might be most effective as a COVID-19 therapeutic, bypassing exhaustive laboratory trial and error,\u201d Klivans said. \u201cModern datasets, however, are often diffuse or noisy and tend to confound current techniques. Our AI institute will dig deep into the foundations of machine learning so that new AI systems will be robust to these challenges.\u201d Additionally, many advanced AI applications are limited by computational constraints. For example, algorithms designed to help machines recognize, categorize and label images can\u2019t keep up with the massive amount of video data that people upload to the internet every day, and advances in this field could have implications across multiple industries. \u201cMachine learning has seeped into practically every area of science and industry, from video processing to drug design to finance to physical simulations,\u201d said Klivans. \u201cA key mission will be to develop core technologies that can break through obstacles common to all of these areas.\u201d Dimakis notes that algorithms will be designed to train video models efficiently. For example, Facebook, one of the AI institute\u2019s industry partners, is interested in using these algorithms to make its platform more accessible to people with visual impairments. And in a partnership with Dell Medical School, AI institute researchers will test these algorithms to expedite turnaround time for medical imaging diagnostics, possibly reducing the time it takes for patients to get critical assessments and treatment. The NSF is investing more than $100 million in five new AI institutes nationwide, including the $20 million project based at UT Austin to advance the foundations of machine learning. In addition to Facebook, Netflix, YouTube, Dell Technologies and the city of Austin have signed on to transfer this research into practice. Karen Willcox is director of the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at UT Austin. She writes: \"Machine learning represents an increasingly important aspect of our research agenda in computational science, which at its core develops mathematical models and simulations to understand physical and natural systems. We are very pleased to have Oden Institute researchers playing a significant role in the MLL effort, aiming to bring together the power of physics-based modeling with data-driven learning.\" The institute will also pursue the creation of an online master\u2019s degree in AI, along with undergraduate research programming and online AI courses for high schoolers and working professionals. Austin-based tech entrepreneurs Amir Husain , founder and CEO of SparkCognition , an Austin-based artificial intelligence company, and Zaib Husain, founder of Makerarm , a company that produces a robotic arm system for manufacturing, are supporting the new Machine Learning Laboratory with a generous donation of $5 million to sustain its long-term mission of the Machine Learning Laboratory. \u201cHelping advance the science of AI and machine learning is deeply meaningful to both of us,\u201d the Husains wrote in a joint statement. \u201cFor decades, UT has been a leader in computer science research and, specifically, in artificial intelligence. The knowledge representation, genetic algorithms and related advancements that have come out of the Department of Computer Science have informed Amir's entrepreneurial journey.\u201d \u201cThe university\u2019s strengths in computer science, engineering, public policy, business and law can help drive applications of AI,\u201d Amir Husain said. \u201cAnd Austin\u2019s booming tech scene is destined to be a major driver for the local and national economy for decades to come.\u201d The Machine Learning Laboratory is based in the Department of Computer Science and is a collaboration among faculty, researchers and students from across the university, including Texas Computing; Texas Robotics; the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences; the Department of Mathematics; the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; the Department of Information, Risk & Operations Management; the School of Information; the Good Systems AI ethics grand challenge team; the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences; and the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).

Beyond volunteering and direct monetary donations, there is a push for more people to eat from local restaurants. As the Restaurant Performance Index (RPI) decreases, it\u2019s crucial for community-conscious people to support their neighborhood eateries and help keep these businesses afloat. To help bridge the gap between restaurants and customers, several UT Students recently created LocoEats . The website is a collaborative effort from Texas Computer Science (TXCS) student Aadhithya Kannan, and Texas Honors Computer Science and Business students Kevin Qi and Tejas Mehta. \u201cLocoEats connects you to locally-owned restaurants around you. We hope to support these locally-owned businesses during these difficult times by generating awareness and customers for them,\u201d said the creators. Once users land on the website, they\u2019re prompted to share their location and either search for nearby restaurants or to browse by meal category. Users are then presented with a list and can filter the results according to the price point, delivery options, and operating time. Recently, the developers added a new category specifically for Black-owned restaurants. They included the category to \u201cexpress support for the Black Community in the fight against systemic racism.\u201d Locally-owned restaurants may not have the resources to promote their business and reach potential new customers. The impact of this lack of resources is particularly strong during this time, as many businesses are losing money during the pandemic and can\u2019t afford advertising efforts. LocoEats is giving these restaurants exposure during a time when they need it the most, and helping communities better serve each other.

    "text_content": "Exploring Passive RFID Tag Use For Sensory Technology | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Exploring Passive RFID Tag Use For Sensory Technology Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Wednesday, March 3, 2021 PhD graduate Dr. Swadhin Pradhan and his advisor Professor Lili Qiu When was the last time you changed out a battery in your house? Studies show that battery-powered devices are used substantially in modern times, Americans use nearly 3 billion batteries every year . Batteries are currently popular because they are able to make electric devices, such as flashlights and watches, portable. However, our usage of batteries extends further from just portable electronic devices. We also use batteries for essential, non-portable electronic devices, such as thermostats and many other sensory appliances. When it comes to such devices, the use of batteries is unnecessary and becomes a hindrance. These batteries must be constantly replaced and over time become time-consuming and costly. A challenge today in the tech industry is figuring out ways to reduce the reliance on batteries for sensory appliances. One of the main reasons battery devices are popular among sensory appliances is convenience: no one wants a wire stretching from an outlet to a thermostat. To tackle such a problem we need to figure out ways to transfer energy from a consistent power source, such as outlets, without the use of wires. It is this type of research that UT Computer Science researcher and recent PhD graduate Dr. Swadhin Pradhan , with assistance from his advisor Professor Lili Qiu , has dedicated his work to. Swadhin Pradhan currently works at Cisco Meraki and researches wireless systems, machine learning, and internet-of-things (IoT) systems. In his research article, \u201c RTSense: RFID based Temperature Sensing ,\u201d which was recently presented in ACM SenSys 2020 , Dr. Pradhan and Prof. Lili Qiu explores how passive RFID tags could solve this problem of battery-dependent sensory devices. Passive RFID tags have existed for almost twenty years now, mainly used for identification and tracking. Passive RFID tags are made up of two components: an antenna and an integrated circuit chip (the actual tag). The circuit chips have no energy of their own\u2014they don\u2019t have a battery and are also not connected to an outlet. They operate purely by absorbing radio frequency energy transmitted from RFID antennas. The radio frequency wave from the antenna energizes the tag, then it sends back information encoded in its memory back to the antenna. These aspects of passive RFID tags make them perfect for sensory appliances. The idea behind RTSENSE, the name of the RFID system that Pradhan and his team use to measure temperatures, is fairly simple to understand. Pradhan and Prof. Lili Qiu essentially designed an analytical model that observes the change in electrical resistance in a passive tag caused by temperature change. RTSENSE consists of 2 stages, calibration and estimation. The calibration step is a quick but essential step performed during installation that does not need to be repeated even when tag orientation or distance changes. During this step, the reader continuously reads the tag-pair and records all responses This stage aims to figure out the effect temperature has on this system. With this information, the system is able to effectively estimate temperature in the estimation stage. Temperature is measured by recording the phase difference during 10 seconds. This average is then put in a regression model that estimates temperature. Dr. Pradhan measures the readiness of this technology by using three categories to evaluate how well the system performs: a passive RFID tag sensory system must be able to consistently achieve high accuracy, maintain robustness against environmental change, and possess a good sensing range. Previous systems have performed well in an individual category but have failed to perform well in the other two. However, RTSENSE is able to perform well in all these 3 categories. Though temperature sensing using passive RFID tags is still not ready to be used commercially, this research marks a significant step in that journey. The potential for such technology is immense. Pradhan foresees that such a type of technology will develop enough to where it could lead to personalized temperature control. He envisions a future where this technology allows each room in a house to have the ability to have its own temperature. The commercial implications are also immense\u2014such technology could save companies a considerable amount of money and reduce battery waste. Though this technology is not quite there yet, it has the potential to be, as Pradhan puts it, \"a technology that becomes so good, people forget that it exists.\"This research plays a big role in the journey of this technology to reach that point, it has proven that sensing can be done with passive RFID tags in an efficient manner.

Graduating from The University of Texas at Austin, for Jones, \u201cwas a game-changer.\u201d After graduating, she started working at a startup in Austin called 360Commerce. As a Black woman who was the first in her family to graduate from college, entering the technology field in the early aughts meant diving head-first \u201cinto a world I didn\u2019t know.\u201d In her early career, Jones was \u201calways the only woman, most of the time. And all of the time the only Black woman on the tech team.\u201d Her experience made her question why there weren\u2019t more Black women programmers and how to change this lack of diversity. In 2004, when Oracle acquired 360Commerce, Jones saw an opportunity to create the type of diverse work environment that she dreamed of. Rather than join another company and show management the value of a diverse workforce, Jones decided to make her own company, with diversity built into its DNA. Her company, called Lillii RNB, stands for \u201cLet\u2019s imagine life with ladies in IT\u201d and is an IT consultancy that works with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. From the beginning, her \u201cgoal was to have a team that looks like the world.\u201d This purposeful diversity not only allowed more people into the tech industry, but it played a strategic role. \u201cWhen you have that many ideas with a diverse group of people, it makes us very valuable to our clients,\u201d said Jones. \u201cTo me, if you want to diversify your teams, you can. And that was my mission, and now we have a very diverse team, so it definitely can be done. And those developers are out there, you have to have the desire to find them,\u201d she said. Jones found that the biggest struggle while starting her business \u201cwas raising capital to get my business off the ground.\u201d After failing to get enough capital, Jones saved $250,000 of her own money to finance her business. From there, she was able to start her business and hire employees, whom she had to train in the relatively obscure technology. Now, Lillii RNB is off the ground and doing well. They\u2019re doing so well that they are working on a technology solution with the potential to help cities open up as many are under strict guidelines during COVID-19. She participated in the Ascend 2020 Cohort III, and while working with three other small business owners, proposed a method that would allow cities to safely open. Her cohort designed a method of installing Internet of Things (IoT) devices throughout different buildings being cleaned. As the cleaning is complete, the devices update the dashboard to show where and when each building was sanitized. They proposed the idea to the city of Atlanta, and are now working on deploying the technology. \u201cI was thinking about accountability,\u201d she said. Jones believed that cities that were equipped with data would make their reopening efforts both more secure and justifiable. It\u2019s one thing to open a city during a pandemic, it\u2019s another to actually track with metrics and dashboards the methods that prove that a city is doing it safely. \u201cWe can tell city officials \u2018This is how we\u2019re reopening, this is how we\u2019re cleaning, this is how we\u2019re making sure that buildings are getting clean and are safe.\u2019\u201d Jones is excited to see where her career and company take her. Her story is an example of the power being courageous, following your passion, and having the willingness to be the lone voice in the room championing for change. In her words: \u201cIt starts with us.\u201d News Categories Alumni Tags Alumni diversity and inclusion COVID-19",

    "text_content": "Investigating How to Make Robots Better Team Members | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Investigating How to Make Robots Better Team Members Posted by Angela Schiff on Friday, July 17, 2020 Imagine that you are a robot in a hospital: composed of bolts and bits, running on code, and surrounded by humans. It\u2019s your first day on the job, and your task is to help your new human teammates\u2014the hospital\u2019s employees\u2014do their job more effectively and efficiently. Mainly, you\u2019re fetching things. You\u2019ve never met the employees before, and don\u2019t know how they handle their tasks. How do you know when to ask for instructions? At what point does asking too many questions become disruptive? This is the core question that a team of researchers at Texas Computer Science (TXCS) have been trying to figure out. In a paper entitled \" A Penny for Your Thoughts: The Value of Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork ,\" Reuth Mirsky , William Macke , Andy Wang, Harel Yedidsion , and Peter Stone \u201cinvestigate how to design artificial agents that can communicate in order to be valuable members in a team.\u201d In \u201cA Penny for our Thoughts,\u201d the research team explored the service robot example to highlight a situation where an artificial agent must learn to work with people with no prior knowledge of the collaborative environment. These service robots, who mainly have to retrieve supplies for physicians or nurses, have two main goals to balance: understanding the task-specific goals of their human teammates, and understanding when it is appropriate to ask questions over acting autonomously. As Reuth Mirsky explains, \u201cwe as people are very good at that most of the time.\u201d In part, this is due to a human\u2019s ability to reason about other people\u2019s motives through facial cues, body language, language, and a plethora of other explicit and non-explicit cues that can communicate intent. \u201cWe have it hardwired in our brains\u201d that others have goals and act accordingly to accomplish them, and in collaborative environments, it\u2019s relatively easy to intuit how to help them or when to ask other people questions. This sort of logic is something that \u201cyou have to write down to the machine.\u201d The subtle nuances of human interaction that make it possible for people to get along have to be observed, analyzed, and transcribed into a logical framework that a machine can understand. To help machines understand when to ask a question or when to act on their own, the team made the \u201cassumption that asking something has a specific cost.\u201d To help reduce costs, the team defined theoretically the times when it was not appropriate to ask at all. If a robot has the same routine of checking inventory at a certain time, it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to ask about the task every time as there is no ambiguity about what the robot should do: it already knows the procedure, and the procedure is static. On the other hand, when the robot is tasked with something that varies significantly from a standard routine or when the robot is given a new goal, it becomes important to ask. \u201cWe are only interested in the window in the middle, when the robot needs to ask something that is not clear and if it won\u2019t ask, then it might take a wrong action,\u201d said Mirsky. Ultimately, the team framed the problem like this: \u201cIn order to be useful collaborators, the robot\u2019s main goal is to assist.\u201d From this main goal, the robot learns to choose its own goal, which may be fetching an item in a certain way or assisting in a different manner. \u201cSo if it understands the goals of its teammates, it can be a good helper. The queries are about the goals of the other agents. So, \u201cAre you trying to do this, or are you trying to do that?\u201d According to the answer [it] gets, [it\u2019ll] be able to act accordingly.\u201d Mirsky, who completed her Ph.D. at Ben-Gurion University and had a heavy theoretical research background in the AI space, wanted to work on research that has material applications in the real world. She notes that with recent advancements in AI and robotics, more work is being done designing \u201chuman-aware AI,\u201d and that there is a necessity for researchers to design these types of \u201calgorithms and to design machines that are able to collaborate.\u201d This desire led her to TXCS professor Peter Stone\u2019s AI Lab . \u201cWhen I got to Peter\u2019s lab, because he\u2019s doing a lot of research in these areas and he cares a lot about doing something practical and something with use in the real world,\u201d she was inspired \u201cto take some of my more theoretical research and apply it to a specific problem, a real problem.\u201d The research team continues to study multi-agent systems and plans to use the insights from the initial publication to expand upon their work. \" A Penny for Your Thoughts: The Value of Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork \" will be presented at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).

    "text_content": "Power of DNA to Store Information Gets an Upgrade | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Power of DNA to Store Information Gets an Upgrade Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, July 15, 2020 Article by Esther R Robards-Forbes | College of Natural Sciences A team of interdisciplinary researchers has discovered a new technique to store information in DNA \u2013 in this case \"The Wizard of Oz,\" translated into Esperanto \u2013 with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. The technique harnesses the information-storage capacity of intertwined strands of DNA to encode and retrieve information in a way that is both durable and compact. The technique is described in a paper in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"The key breakthrough is an encoding algorithm that allows accurate retrieval of the information even when the DNA strands are partially damaged during storage,\" said Ilya Finkelstein, an associate professor of molecular biosciences and one of the authors of the study. Humans are creating information at exponentially higher rates than we used to, contributing to the need for a way to store more information efficiently and in a way that will last a long time. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are among those exploring using DNA to store information. \"We need a way to store this data so that it is available when and where it's needed in a format that will be readable,\" said Stephen Jones, a research scientist who collaborated on the project with Finkelstein; Bill Press, a professor jointly appointed in computer science and integrative biology; and Ph.D. alumnus John Hawkins. \"This idea takes advantage of what biology has been doing for billions of years: storing lots of information in a very small space that lasts a long time. DNA doesn't take up much space, it can be stored at room temperature, and it can last for hundreds of thousands of years.\" DNA is about 5 million times more efficient than current storage methods. Put another way, a one milliliter droplet of DNA could store the same amount of information as two Walmarts full of data servers. And DNA doesn't require permanent cooling and hard disks that are prone to mechanical failures. There's just one problem: DNA is prone to errors. And when a genetic code has errors, it's a lot different from when a computer code has errors. Errors in computer codes tend to show up as blank spots in the code. Errors in DNA sequences show up as insertions or deletions. The problem there is that when something is deleted or added in DNA, the whole sequence shifts, with no blank spots to alert anyone. Previously, when information was stored in DNA, the piece of information that needed to be saved, such as a paragraph from a novel, would be repeated 10 to 15 times. When the information was read, the repetitions would be compared to eliminate any insertions or deletions. \"We found a way to build the information more like a lattice,\" Jones said. \"Each piece of information reinforces other pieces of information. That way, it only needs to be read once.\" The language the researchers developed also avoids sections of DNA that are prone to errors or that are difficult to read. The parameters of the language can also change with the type of information that is being stored. For instance, a dropped word in a novel is not as big a deal as a dropped zero in a tax return. To demonstrate information retrieval from degraded DNA, the team subjected its \"Wizard of Oz\" code to high temperatures and extreme humidity. Even though the DNA strands were damaged by these harsh conditions, all the information was still decoded successfully. \"We tried to tackle as many problems with the process as we could at the same time,\" said Hawkins, who recently was with UT's Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. \"What we ended up with is pretty remarkable.\" Bill Press is the Warren J. and Viola M. Raymer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology at UT Austin and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. The research was funded by a College of Natural Sciences Catalyst Grant, the Welch Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.

Professor Biswas leads the AMRL, a UT Austin research group that \u201cperforms research in robotics to continually make robots more autonomous, accurate, robust, and efficient, in real-world unstructured environments.\u201d In the video above, the robot, referred to as the UT Campus-Jackal, navigated entirely autonomously from The Gates Dell Complex (GDC) to the Anna Hiss Gymnasium (AHG). The route, which was about 0.6 miles, required the robot to reason about its precise state in the world in real-time, despite unexpected variations in the world including construction, vehicular traffic, and pedestrians, stay on-track and avoid going off-course. Biswas and his team have been working on topics related to long-term outdoor navigation since 2015 when he worked as an assistant professor at The University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The UT Campus-Jackal is one of two platforms (another being a larger robot called UT Campus-Husky) that the team uses to undertake research on perception and planning for long-term autonomy. This topic includes exploration of building perceptual models that can adapt to changing environments in real-time, allowing agents to identify perception failures independently, and learning robot customization from human demonstrations. A key to the robot\u2019s successful navigation was the localization method used. At the basic level, localization is how an autonomous agent knows where it is on the map, in relation to other elements. The AMRL used episodic non-Markov localization (EnML), a method introduced by Biswas and Manuela M. Veloso, that \u201creasons about the world as consisting of three classes of objects: long-term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects, short-term features corresponding to unmapped static objects, and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects.\u201d Imagine that the robot the AMRL deployed was sent out to navigate autonomously at three different times during UT Austin\u2019s academic calendar: during freshman orientation, during a Student Organization fair, and during midterms. In each scenario, the robot is navigating the same distance and the same path. It can expect that the building and statues that it passes to remain constant throughout each excursion. Yet, each time that it\u2019s deployed, the robot experiences non-static objects that can affect its journey: lost freshmen, tables, packs of students making their way to class. For robots that are deployed long-term, these potential changes need to be accounted for, and the robot has to understand that the map it has of the terrain most likely won\u2019t remain static. EnML is a localization method that helps autonomous agents account for the changes in their environment, to help them navigate in a more natural way. Biswas stated that the AMRL is \u201cexcited to have the robot autonomously perform experiments during such deployments, to improve its own perception algorithms in the wild,\u201d noting that they are \u201calso interested in performing such tasks like mail and package delivery.\u201d This project is being funded by UT\u2019s Good Systems , which is a grand challenge working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human values.

Pending final approval by UT System and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the new program will be a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science , ranked among the top 10 programs in the country by U.S. News and World Report; the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences , one of the university\u2019s newest and fastest-growing departments; and online learning company edX . \u201cUT Austin is home to top leaders in diverse disciplines ranging from statistics to data science to machine learning,\u201d said Paul Goldbart, dean of UT Austin\u2019s College of Natural Sciences. \u201cThese talented faculty experts are joining together to advance a highly relevant new master\u2019s degree program that will prepare our students for professional success across nearly every industry.\u201d The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that by 2026, there will be a need for 11.5 million more data scientists. Data science professionals tackle projects within organizations as diverse as searching for a COVID-19 vaccine, engineering cybersecurity solutions, and helping publishers and broadcasters understand their audiences\u2019 preferences. \u201cData science is the fastest growing career field in the world, and there is a huge demand for experts,\u201d said Michael Mahometa, director of consulting and professional development in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences. \u201cThere are very few aspects of the modern economy that data science doesn\u2019t touch.\u201d UT Austin\u2019s online data science master\u2019s degree will be the first from a top-tier university to be available for less than the cost of a new economy car. Students who receive admission to the program will be able to complete the degree for about $10,000, in contrast to other competitive, nationally ranked institutions with data sciences degrees, for whom the cost of tuition ranges from $20,000-$70,000. The degree program is designed to offer flexibility, allowing prospective students to attend part time on their own schedules. \u201cToo often, qualified students forgo graduate study because of factors such as family obligations, the need to maintain an income, or the fear of not being able to afford tuition,\u201d said Don Fussell, chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201cOur objective when we embarked on this project was to create the first technical data science master\u2019s degree that didn\u2019t force students to make those tradeoffs.\u201d The Department of Computer Science launched a successful computer science online master\u2019s degree program last year in conjunction with edX. The new program will build on the achievements of that program. To be admitted into the program, candidates must have completed an undergraduate degree, ideally in science or engineering, and taken the GRE. Program leaders are encouraging candidates with degrees in other fields to apply if they have a passion for data science and work experience in the field. Applications for the new data science online master\u2019s program will open this summer. News Categories Graduate Program Tags Data Science online master\u2019s Statistics and Data Sciences edX",

    "text_content": "TXCS Researchers Explore How Artificial Agents Collaborate on a Shared Task | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TXCS Researchers Explore How Artificial Agents Collaborate on a Shared Task Posted by Angela Schiff on Wednesday, August 5, 2020 There\u2019s an (albeit clich\u00e9) saying that says that two heads are better than one. Unsurprisingly, this idiom extends to artificial agents. In the field of AI, researchers have been working to understand how to make independent agents, who may have different goals, work together in an environment to complete a shared task. A group of researchers in Texas Computer Science (TXCS) comprising Ishan Durugkar , Elad Liebman , and TXCS professor Peter Stone have been working to solve this problem. In \u201cBalancing Individual Preferences and Shared Objectives in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning,\u201d which is included in the proceedings for the 29th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in July, the research team explores frameworks in which preferences are balanced between agents to allow for more efficient task completion. Artificial agents, much like humans, may need to work together to solve a problem. Unlike humans, artificial agents don\u2019t have an innate ability to reason or cooperate. Teams composed of researchers, scientists, and engineers must develop methods of programming an artificial agent\u2019s ability to understand the goals of both itself and others so they can become better team members. While agents assigned to a task may have the same end-goal, such as organizing a room, the tasks that they are specifically programmed for and their methods of reaching the goal could vary drastically. This could lead to a group of agents that work against rather than with each other. To make the process go as efficiently as possible, all agents must understand and work within the parameters of the other agent\u2019s goals. Durugkar illustrated the issue in terms of a band. \u201cConsider a group of musicians,\u201d he said. \u201cEach of them might have a preference on which type of song they would like to perform, but ultimately they want to entertain their audience.\u201d That\u2019s where the research team\u2019s work steps in: they examine \u201chow to enable agents to cooperate in such a scenario by balancing their preferences with the shared task.\u201d The team taught the artificial agents by \u201cusing the paradigm of reinforcement learning.\u201d In a scenario where agents have a project where each agent may have a preference on how to complete the task, the research team studied the behavior of these agents \u201cwith varying degrees of selfishness when they tried to collaborate on a task.\u201d Selfishness, in this scenario meaning an artificial agent\u2019s desire to follow their individual preference rather than acquiescing to the preferences of the other agents. Unexpectedly, they found that in these scenarios, agents \u201cbeing a little selfish and attempting to satisfy their individual preferences while solving the shared task actually leads to faster learning and coordination.\u201d In addition, they validated through experiments a way to \u201cfind how much each agent should focus on its own preference as opposed to the shared task.\u201d Read more about \u201cBalancing Individual Preferences and Shared Objectives in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning\u201d on Peter Stone's selected publications page .",

Hour of Code Hour of Code is an initiative led by the non-profit Code.org to encourage non-programmers to spend an hour programming. The Hour of Code lessons are available all year, but the focus of the initiative is to get people to participate during Computer Science Education Week in early December. The goal is to expose people to programming to give them some understanding of what a computer scientist is and so that they may eventually choose that career path\u2014or encourage others to do so. Hour of Code Teacher Resources UT Computer Science has facilitated the Hour of Code initiative at local grade schools since December 2015. The UTCS community\u2014undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends\u2014work together to either lead grade-school students through the Hour of Code lesson or to provide support to their teachers as they do so. In exchange for our help, we request that teachers allow each volunteer to introduce themselves and explain why they chose computer science and why they stayed in computer science\u2014our field is large and varied, and we are here for many different reasons. In doing so, we hope to expose the students to the diversity within our field. Classroom Programs Our classroom programs are designed to introduce students to coding in 6-8 weeks. Working in teams of approximately five, we travel to a local school for an hour each week, and we introduce coding through hands-on activities. We also strive to inspire the students through open-ended projects that capture their imaginations. For most of our programs, we are using LEGO Mindstorms or Kano Kits . You can check out our curricula page for more information. In addition to teaching coding, we introduce the idea of computer science and how its concepts can be used to change the world. How is it going? We are currently running or facilitating seven classroom programs at six schools: Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (High) Bertha Sadler Means Young Women's Leadership Academy (Middle) Maplewood Elementary Barbara Jordan Elementary Perez Elementary Sunset Valley Elementary All told, these programs, which are led by approximately 45 UTCS student mentors, are reaching approximately 230 K-12 students this school year. While it is too early to measure long-term results, our mentors report that the programs are going well and the students seem interested. We have found that programs that take place during the school day in the classroom (as opposed to an afterschool coding club) are more successful.

    "text_content": "Standing Together in the College of Natural Sciences | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Standing Together in the College of Natural Sciences Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, June 2, 2020 A message from Dean Paul Goldbart to the College of Natural Sciences community underscores the need to stand in solidarity and support one another. This post was updated on Tuesday, June 2 to include a statement from the CNS Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Dear College of Natural Sciences community members, The crushing anguish of this moment is undeniably sharpened with each detail we learn about the individuals whose names are evoked repeatedly. Breonna Taylor, a health care professional who dreamed her life's work would be in caring for patients, was killed in her home. George Floyd, from Houston and pursuing a new start in a new place, now is survived by his 6 year old daughter, another Texan. Ahmaud Arbery was planning to attend college in the fall in my former hometown when he went for a jog that culminated in atrocity. Theirs are but the latest violent deaths in a long string of violent deaths. We must acknowledge the suffering dehumanization and racism cause. Today, a student posed a question to me. Essentially it was an invitation to think about how I can do more than stand, in grief and anger, with Black students, colleagues and community members burdened under the weight of our current moment. How can I also move forward with them \u2013 through a commitment to do more listening, more reflection, more seeking out educational resources at UT and beyond? Together, we can and must build a just and equitable university and indeed society. Below is a message from our CNS Diversity & Inclusion Committee that provides suggestions and resources for moving forward together through this time. I am grateful to both the committee and our College's student-led Council for Diversity Engagement , which informs ongoing work in Natural Sciences and beyond to build equity and inclusion. I encourage you to review the committee's ideas for action and other resources below \u2013 only a starting point certainly, but one compiled by students, faculty and staff here in CNS for the benefit of our community. Perhaps I may close for now by emphasizing that I am committed, along with UT's Coalition of Diversity and Inclusion Officers , to building a college where all know that they belong and have exquisite value \u2013 and where dehumanization and hatred have no place. To echo what I have said elsewhere, as we grapple with the structural failings of our society I ask that we each do our best to steady our community and beyond by reaching out and offering encouragement through word and deed to anyone among us \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 who may be in need. Respectfully, Paul Goldbart Dean A Message from the College Diversity & Inclusion Committee Our community is hurting. In light of recent events, many people are feeling rage, numbness, confusion, hurt, and resolve to say enough is enough. The CNS D&I Committee will continue to work on fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable environment. This begins with listening and reflecting on what more we can do to create a powerful sense of belonging and solidarity. We realize that this is a lifelong commitment to uplifting one another. Below are few steps that can be taken to start the long, hard process of enacting change: Engage in self-reflection. See this list of suggested readings from The New York Times as a starting point. Continue educating yourself and your peers. Invite groups that specialize in these areas of advocacy to carry conversations about racial justice forward. Share resources, offer support to, and connect with organizations dedicated to building a more equitable future (in any way you can). Commit to implementing actions from the CNS Ideas for Action page into your daily life. The murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd highlight the realities that members of our community face on a daily basis \u2013 realities that are manifestations of deeply ingrained, systemic discrimination against the Black community. As scientists and educators, we believe that knowledge and active engagement, combined with empathy, provide profound paths forward in the face of hate and fear. While we may not have all the answers, we are committed to dismantling inequities and building a more mutually supportive community. We are proud to endorse the statement made by the UT Coalition of Diversity and Inclusion Officers and invite you to join us and your fellow members of CNS in making lasting change for the better. CNS Diversity & Inclusion Committee Members: Undergraduate Students: Zoe de Beurs, Brett Dolotina, Maria Henriquez, Gabrielle McDaniel, Lois Owolabi, Rohit Prasad, Shilpa Rajagopal, Eisha Rao Graduate Students: Kelly Wallace Staff: Vivian Abagiu, Becky Kester, Alyssa Ray, Melissa Taylor Faculty: Caitlin Casey, Mirela Ciperiani, Calvin Lin, Tony Gonzalez, Shalene Jha, Michael Drew, Carlos Baiz, Thushani Herath, Alyssa Ray Statement by the Coalition of Diversity and Inclusion Officers As diversity officers at the University of Texas at Austin, we are grieved, horrified, saddened by the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, as well as countless others who have lost their lives to acts of racial violence. These egregious acts of racial profiling, physical violence, and death of Black individuals are taking place against a backdrop of a global pandemic that places in bold relief the wrenching inequities that have divided our nation as the virus disproportionately ravages communities of color. We recognize that we are experiencing more than just a moment of discomfort and discontent. Our nation's dark history has led to this critical moment in time. This is a history that we must grapple with, as we collectively struggle to move forward together. As diversity officers we want our community and particularly its Black members, many of whom grew up in the same city as George Floyd and may have known him or his people, to know that we are here for you. We understand that these recent senseless events are triggering, tragic, and a stark reminder that Black lives are fragile and can be stolen from us at any moment. We urge everyone to remember that if one of us is hurting, then we all hurt. Our silence in the face of injustice sends a negative message to the most vulnerable members of our university community. Now, more than ever, we reaffirm and reinvigorate our commitment to supporting an equitable, inclusive, and just institution in which violence, hate, and intolerance are not accepted and are actively combatted. We encourage all members of our university community to check in on and support each other, recognizing that these recent events differently impact our students and colleagues in very deep and personal ways. We also encourage our community members to reach out directly to their college or school's diversity officer for any support, guidance, and resources that they may need.

    "text_content": "Computer Science Researcher Aims to Automate Software Development | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science Researcher Aims to Automate Software Development Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, March 23, 2022 Isil Dillig is an associate professor of computer science who works to improve the security and reliability of software systems and automatically generate programs from high-level specifications. She received a Sloan Research Fellowship and an NSF CAREER award. Could you describe your main research interests? My research is at the intersection of programming languages and artificial intelligence. My overarching goal is to make it easier for people to write software that's correct and doesn't have security vulnerabilities. There are two main parts to my research. In one, I look at techniques to automatically reason about programs, so we can either find problems or security vulnerabilities in them or prove that they actually behave as they were designed to behave. The other part of my research is a field called program synthesis where the goal is to automatically generate programs based on high-level expressions of user intent. What does program synthesis entail and what are some of the potential applications? Program synthesis allows people to program computers without actually writing code. For instance, the user can give a few examples to illustrate what they want the program to do, and then the synthesizer can generalize from those examples and generate a program that automates the desired task. There are many applications of program synthesis, some targeting end-users, and some targeting programmers. For example, some of my work has used program synthesis to automate various tasks like data querying, wrangling, and visualization, which arise under many guises in different contexts. My work has also used program synthesis to simplify programming tasks that are considered very challenging, such as writing multithreaded code. How did you find your way to computer science? Unlike a lot of the students I teach at UT, I actually didn't have much exposure to computer science in high school. I accidentally discovered my interest in it after taking an introductory computer science class when I was a sophomore at Stanford and then I decided to declare myself a computer science major. I also got involved in CS research as an undergrad and decided to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of programming languages. What is the most rewarding part of your work here at UT? I find it very rewarding to mentor and do research with my group of amazing Ph.D. students. I also really enjoy teaching UT undergrads. What would you recommend to students interested in pursuing computer science? Take lots of different CS classes! And if you take someone's class and you're really interested in the material, don't be shy about reaching out to faculty members to do research with them. The worst that can happen is they say no, but in that situation, you're not any worse off than if you never asked. So just get out of your comfort zone! Plus, people always like to hear that someone found their work interesting. Cross-posted from the College of Natural Sciences news .

Researchers at six universities, including The University of Texas at Austin, are launching a partnership aimed at turning these AI \"black boxes\" into human-interpretable computer code, allowing them to solve hitherto unsolvable problems. The new partnership, called Understanding the World Through Code , is made possible by a major new grant from the National Science Foundation, through its Expeditions in Computing program. This initiative is focused on \"ambitious fundamental research agendas that promise to define the future of computing and information.\" These grants, given to just three teams every two years, are the largest given by the NSF's Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. \"In science, at the end of the day, you want to develop an understanding of the world,\" said Swarat Chaudhuri , associate professor of computer science at UT Austin and one of 12 principal investigators on the team. \"That's why the goal is not just to come up with a black box that gives you cool predictions in narrow applications, but to open it up and discover principles that can be applied to other problems. Our main insight is that these principles can be written down as programs of the sort that human coders write, and that we can design algorithms that automatically generate these programs from troves of scientific data.\" Isil Dillig , associate professor of computer science, is the team's other principal investigator from UT Austin. The leading institution for the collaboration is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The other institutions involved are the California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania. On this project, the researchers plan to develop programming languages that can represent insights derived from highly complex scientific data sets. Their algorithms for automatically generating these insights will use a combination of program synthesis, which is a body of techniques for automating computer programming, and deep learning, the most popular contemporary approach to AI. The researchers will work on applications in four domains: \u200b organic chemistry (for example, designing drug molecules that have desired properties); cognitive science (for example, understanding how children learn language or counting); cell biology (for example, understanding how organisms turn genetic code into specific proteins); and engineering of complex networked systems (for example, developing strategies for data centers to handle spikes in usage). Some of the research will be conducted using the computing resources of UT Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center . The NSF grant totals $10 million over 5 years, about $1.65 million of which will come to UT Austin. News Categories Research Tags Artificial Intelligence",

The competition consisted of 60 teams of 3 students from 60 schools (approximately 180 students) from across the U.S. and Canada. UT Austin solved 6 of the 12 problems and came in 13th out of 60 . In addition to that contest, one of the sponsors, the NSA , ran a Cyber Security Challenge. UT Austin won that competition! Our three students earned $500 each in prize money. The three students are: Aditya Durvasula ('19), Aaron Lamoreaux ('23), and Viraj Maddur ('23). They will compete again at the ICPC World Finals this coming June in Moscow, Russia. UT has been competing in ICPC since 1997. This summer will be UT's fourth consecutive appearance at the world finals. UT went to the 2016 world finals in South Dakota, the 2017 world finals in Beijing, and the 2018 world finals in Portugal. UT has seen marked improvement since the creation of a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming in 2014, taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing , and the student officers of the UT Programming Contest . The ICPC traces its roots to 1970 when the first competition was hosted by pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society . The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to increase problem-solving aptitude and opportunities of the strongest students in the field of computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the contest has expanded into a worldwide collaborative of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world\u2019s universities. The ICPC is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation and is headquartered at Baylor University . The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The contest has raised aspirations and performance of generations of the world\u2019s problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering.

As these websites evolve to meet the demands of their users, so must the software and the database schema, i.e., the model that determines the layout of the data. This process is extremely time-consuming and error-prone, because developers not only need to transform the data, but also re-implement all the affected parts of the application. Yuepeng Wang , a sixth-year PhD student in Dr. I\u015f\u0131l Dillig \u2019s UTOPIA Research Group at UT Austin, is working to automate this process, so that people can more correctly and easily evolve their database applications. \u201cWhat Yuepeng is doing is important and special because he is addressing a real pain point in software development that no one has ever looked at before,\u201d says Dr. Dillig. \u201cIt has many real-world applications in the software industry and I find the techniques [he] has developed to be intellectually deep and technically interesting.\u201d These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories of programming language research: verification and synthesis. Verification involves proving that there are no mistakes or bugs in the program. Synthesis takes guidelines such as a logical formulas or example inputs and outputs from the user, and then automatically generates a program that satisfies those specifications. In the context of evolving database applications, Yuepeng\u2019s verification techniques will make it possible to confirm the equivalence between two versions of the software, that operate over different schemas. And in the case that a developer does not want to manually evolve their application, Yuepeng\u2019s synthesis techniques will automatically migrate the original database program to the updated schema, such that the new version is provably equivalent to the old one. In this way, his research has the potential to free developers from tedious code refactoring for database programs and change the future of schema evolution.

Among the authors of this paper are TXCS professor Dr. Robert van de Geijn , as well as TXCS graduates Field Van Zee , Tyler Smith, Bryan Marker, Tze Meng Low, John Gunnels, and Mike Kistler. The prize is awarded every two years to the author(s) of the most outstanding paper, as determined by the selection committee, in the field of parallel scientific and engineering computing published within the four calendar years preceding the award year. The paper in question discusses early results for the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework, which is a dense linear algebra (DLA) toolbox. According to Dr. van de Geijn, DLA functions reside \u201cat the bottom of the food chain\u201d for many applications in computational science, biology, physics, engineering, and various other related fields. These applications rely on common functions that express computation in terms of matrices and vectors. The most computationally intensive of these dense linear algebra functions is matrix-matrix multiplication. The importance of optimizing these calculations was recognized in the 1970s, prompting key community members to propose the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). By providing a common interface, the BLAS allowed portable, high-performance matrix computation to become more widely accessible and achievable. Several notable implementations of the BLAS have been developed over the decades, a significant one among them being GotoBLAS, which was written by Kazushige Goto at the Texas Advanced Computing Center . Goto approached matrix-matrix operations by structuring these implementations using carefully optimized \u201ckernels\u201d written in assembly language. Because the matrix multiplication algorithm employs this kernel within multiple nested loops, any small inefficiencies within the kernel are magnified to result in a noticeable drop in performance. Therefore, these kernels must be highly streamlined. The BLIS team understood what GotoBLAS did well and where it fell short. While the algorithm employed by Goto was sound, the library used a \"large kernel\" design that expressed the algorithm's three innermost loops of computation in terms of low-level assembly code. This was problematic for multiple reasons. The monolithic nature of the kernels resulted in the need for multiple similar yet distinct kernels in order to support other common variations of matrix multiplication, the size and complexity of each kernel required significant time, effort, and expertise to develop and maintain, and the two innermost loops were not eligible for being parallelized within a higher-level construct, which limited the opportunities for obtaining scalable performance on multithreaded architectures. When BLIS architect Field Van Zee began the development effort in 2012, he realized that much of GotoBLAS could be refactored and simplified. By pushing the boundary between the higher-level C code and the low-level assembly code further down, the assembly region of the algorithm was limited to the single innermost loop\u2014 what they call the \u201cmicrokernel.\u201d This function is quite small, making it much easier to write and maintain. \u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to explain in an undergraduate classroom setting,\" says Van Zee. Designing BLIS around a microkernel also meant that all of the differences between the various matrix kernels in GotoBLAS fell away. With fewer, smaller kernels and more of the algorithm expressed in a portable language such as C, the developers of BLIS were able to port BLIS to existing and new microarchitectures with relative ease. This new microkernel structure also paved the way for another early BLIS developer, Tyler Smith, to develop a framework for expressing multicore parallelism. BLIS's refactoring exposed two additional loops that could be parallelized. According to Van Zee, \u201cWe had extra knobs and levers that we could pull to explore how to get the best performance on these really powerful computers.\u201d In this way, the team was able to achieve extremely high performance that took advantage of the dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of cores present on modern processors. The paper that won the team the SIAM prize demonstrates the portability benefits of BLIS on a wide range of architectures. It also shows that, thanks to BLIS' careful redesign, scalable parallelism on multicore and many-core architectures can be easily achieved. \u201cThis research delivers some of the fundamental software used for scientific discovery through computing,\u201d says Dr. van de Geijn. \u201c[It] enables advances that touch our everyday lives.\u201d When asked about the future, the team says that they\u2019re very excited that certain Linux distributions are starting to integrate BLIS. The BLIS framework is now available in Debian Unstable, a variant of Linux whose packages eventually feed into Ubuntu, as well as Gentoo, a Linux distribution that builds its packages from source. But expanding their presence within Linux is just one part of the future that BLIS developers see on the horizon. Some of the graduate students on the team have achieved significant success with augmenting the BLIS approach for the machine learning space, while others have ported its fundamental ideas to GPUs. The team always has an ear to the ground with their friends in industry and academia, listening to see what they think will become important in the future. \u201cWe continue to be surprised at how many other research directions that BLIS has spawned,\u201d says Van Zee. \u201cWe\u2019re still chasing down those leads to this day, seven years after the framework was born.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Research",

At the 39th Annual Eurocrypt conference, one of the premier conferences for \u201cthe theory and applications of cryptographic techniques,\u201d a paper that Professor Brent Waters collaborated on entitled \u201c Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption \u201d was given the award. In addition, \u201c Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile ,\" a paper written by a team of researchers that includes TXCS alumna Franziska Roesner and TXCS faculty member Hovav Shacham , was honored with the Test of Time award at the 41st Annual IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy . The conference is commonly referred to as \u201cOakland,\u201d and is one of the oldest and most prestigious of the major computer security conferences. \u201cFuzzy Identity-Based Encryption,\u201d which was published in 2005, introduced a new type of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)\u201d that viewed \u201can identity as a set of descriptive attributes.\u201d This work is considered groundbreaking for laying the foundation of attribute-based encryption and other advanced notions of encryption. \u201cExperimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile\" showed that modern cars comprise dozens of computers communicating with each other over high-speed internal networks and with the outside world over multiple wired and wireless interfaces. In addition, the paper showed that an attacker who gains control over one embedded computer in a car can spread malware to other embedded computers and cause them to misbehave in ways that can endanger the driver. The paper helped establish the field of automotive cybersecurity. Though these are separate conferences, the Test of Time awards given at Eurocrypt and IEEE generally aim to recognize work in their respective fields that have had a substantial impact on both the real world and the research community when they were first published, while having continued relevance today.

Through a partnership with edX , an online platform for education and learning, the university was able to bring Texas Computer Science\u2019s top-ranked degree to students around the world, in an affordable and flexible program. The inaugural class is composed of students scattered across 15 countries, with ages ranging from 20 to 64. Though the master\u2019s students are located in various time zones and have different schedules, many find that they are still able to connect with each other. Ross Spencer , a current professional who is enrolled in the program, has been able to communicate with his peers and learn from them. He noted, \u201cmy classmates are incredibly bright...I\u2019ve started building relationships that will grow beyond the classroom into a network of like-minded people passionate about our field.\u201d Designed for professionals and students alike, the online master\u2019s program maintains the same quality and rigor of the on-campus program and is taught by Texas CS faculty members. The online master\u2019s program serves as a potential solution for individuals worried about the time and geographic constraints of an on-campus master\u2019s program. Spencer added, \u201cwhen this program was announced and the course selection was made available, I knew I could have the best of both worlds between industry and academia at an affordable price without sacrificing rigor or reputation.\u201d This year, students had the option to take courses in subjects such as machine learning, algorithms, and advanced operating systems. With the announcement of additional courses in the coming semesters such as Android Programming , students will have the opportunity to further tailor their academic experience. Course modules are released on a weekly basis, and students can access them online or through a mobile app. Professors and teaching assistants hold regular office hours, and students are encouraged to ask questions through online Q&A platforms. When asked about her experience with the online instructional environment, master\u2019s student Sherry Xiaoyi Zhu commented that \u201cI have found it a very effective learning mode\u2026.it\u2019s easier for me to arrange my schedule around work and personal life. I am also able to reach out to instructors for any course-related concerns through Piazza and ask questions during the office hours.\u201d Many universities are moving toward online coursework and learning environments as the technology sector grows and the need for skilled technology professionals increases. UT Austin is leading the way in this transition by bringing its world-renowned curriculum entirely online at an affordable cost relative to other programs of similar quality. \u201cUT Austin has a top tier computer science program with a huge network of alumni working all across tech. At the tech companies I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen many past MS and PhD graduates from UT Austin holding high scientist positions. I wanted to achieve the same level of success. With the price of the online courses being so affordable for such a highly reputable program, UT Austin was an easy choice,\u201d said current online master\u2019s student Richie Wales when asked about his choice to enroll in the program. This year, Texas Computer Science faculty and staff have set the standard for online computer science master\u2019s programs\u2014but this is just the beginning.

    "text_content": "TXCS Students Create Program to Find Product Availability and Promote Social Distancing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TXCS Students Create Program to Find Product Availability and Promote Social Distancing Posted by Angela Schiff on Wednesday, April 1, 2020 On Wednesday, March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 (coronavirus) a pandemic. A few days later, Texas Computer Science (TXCS) students Rithwik Pattikonda and Darshan Bhatta returned home for spring break to their homes in Plano and Irving, respectively. Both witnessed how stores struggled with the surge in customers, and realized that these stores, while providing a necessity, were also breeding grounds for the possible transmission of COVID-19. They decided to take action. On Saturday, March, 14, the two students began developing InStok , a website that allows people to locate and monitor the stock of most-needed items locally and online. At the time this story was written, InStok had been running for three days and according to Pattikonda, already had \u201caround a little over 100,000 users per day.\u201d \u201cWhen we got back from college, we noticed that our parents really struggled with finding certain groceries,\u201d said Pattikonda, noting that after watching the news, they saw how the problem seemed to be on a national level. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states on its Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) page that \u201cthe best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus,\u201d and urges people to avoid close contact with one another, grocery stores are seeing an increase in traffic as people stock up on food and other necessities. Many stores are implementing procedures to prevent the transmission of the virus, but social distancing becomes less effective when a crowd of people is gathered in a single place. Pattikonda and Bhatta were worried that shoppers, who may be unable to find an item at one store would then travel to more locations with the hope of finding what they needed\u2014with the unintended side effect of putting more people at risk of catching the virus. Pattikonda, a sophomore, and Bhatta, a junior, met in a linear algebra class and became fast friends. Beyond classroom coding assignments, both students enjoyed working on personal projects and were confident that they could find some way to help ameliorate this issue by collaborating. \u201cThis is going to be a big problem, even in the future, as more and more coronavirus cases come,\u201d said Bhatta. \u201cWe got together and asked \u2018What kind of solution can we find to help with this?\u2019\u201d Pattikonda added, \u201cWe thought we could really knock [the project] out quickly if we worked together.\u201d InStok combs through the websites of several stores\u2014such as Walmart, Target, and CVS\u2014and collects information on each store\u2019s approximate inventory.The website then aggregates this data \u201cinto one website where people can find all the stores where an item is available.\u201d While the store locations that a user is shown depend on their zip code, Bhatta said that they \u201cwanted to be fair to rural areas,\u201d which may not have many stores nearby, but noted that the range shouldn\u2019t exceed 50 miles. Users can input their desired item and zip code in the search bar, and InStok will produce a list of stores that have the item, along with the disclaimer: \u201cIf an item is not on the shelf, it is possibly at the back. If you really need an item, speak to a store associate. Please do not buy more than you need!\u201d Pattikonda and Bhatta are hard at work as they continue to improve InStok and add more features. As of now, they\u2019re playing with the idea of adding more stores, implementing a store traffic feature, and including a crowdsourcing function to help communities better find items. In addition, they\u2019ve brought on two more friends to help them as they focus on scaling InStok for national use. InStok\u2019s future is another aspect that the two have been pondering; pointing specifically toward InStok\u2019s inventory-checking function and ability to compare prices, they noted that the technology can be adapted for various situations. \u201cAfter the pandemic, we hope that it can be useful at higher-demand times, like Black Friday or Christmas where people are really looking for items that may run out,\u201d said Pattikonda. You can visit InStok.org to try out the website.

Each year since 2012, CCS has recognized one or two papers from the conference a decade earlier with a test-of-time award . These are papers that have had the greatest impact on security research and practice over the decade. In 2017, the award was given to a 2007 paper introducing return-oriented programming , authored by current Texas Computer Science professor, Dr. Hovav Shacham . This year, Dr. Shacham has been presented with the award once again, for his 2009 team paper, \" Hey, You, Get Off of My Cloud: Exploring Information Leakage in Third-Party Compute Clouds .\" The paper was a collaborative effort by researchers from UCSD and MIT, and has been very influential. According to Google Scholar, it has been cited over 2000 times, and has even changed the way Amazon thinks about securing their cloud infrastructure. It also introduced terms like \u201ccloud cartography\" and \"placement vulnerability,\" which are now widely used. The paper studied Amazon's EC2 service as an example of an \"infrastructure-as-a-service\" cloud computing system. It showed that it's possible to map out the hardware infrastructure behind EC2, that it's possible for an attacker to run their virtual machine (VM) on the same physical computer as a VM of interest, and that the isolation between VMs running on the same physical computer is insufficient, allowing some information to leak from target VM to attacker VM.

    "text_content": "New Sandboxing Approach in Web Browser Increases Security | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Sandboxing Approach in Web Browser Increases Security Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 UPDATE (Jan. 18, 2021): The new approach to securing web browsers described below is now part of the latest version of the Firefox browser, available to all users . A paper describing this approach received an honorable mention in the National Security Agency's Best Cybersecurity Research Paper Competition . A powerful new approach to securing web browsers, using a tool called WebAssembly , is getting its first real-world application in the Firefox browser. Developed by a team of researchers from The University of Texas at Austin , the University of California San Diego , Stanford University and Mozilla , the approach shifts some of the browser code into \"secure sandboxes\" that prevent malicious code from taking over the user's computer. The new approach is now part of a test release of the Firefox browser for the Linux operating system and could be available on Windows and MacOS platforms within a few months. Web browsers use libraries of code to do common activities \u2014 such as rendering media files including photos, videos and audio \u2014 but these libraries often have unreported bugs that can be exploited by hackers to take control of a computer. \"Modern browsers are the nightmare scenario for security,\" said Hovav Shacham , professor of computer science at UT Austin and co-author of a related paper accepted for presentation at a computer security conference to be held this August. \"They have every feature imaginable. The more features you have, the more bugs there are. And the more bugs there are, the more chances an attacker has to compromise people's devices. Attackers love attacking browsers, and they really understand how to do it.\" To prevent hackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities, the researchers are adapting WebAssembly, a security mechanism originally designed to speed up web applications that run within a browser while keeping those applications within \"secure sandboxes\" that prevent malicious code from taking over the user's computer. Applications that take advantage of WebAssembly include games and apps that perform music streaming, video editing, encryption and image recognition. In the researchers' new approach, called the RLBox framework, some of the browser's own internal components \u2014 those responsible for the decoding of media files \u2014 would be shifted into WebAssembly sandboxes. Shacham co-leads the research with graduate student Shravan Narayan and assistant professor Deian Stefan , both at UC San Diego's Computer Science and Engineering Department. The new approach will initially be applied to a test version of Firefox for the Linux operating system and will secure just one rendering library used for certain fonts. Assuming the initial tests go well, the team expects the approach will be gradually expanded to include stable, full release versions of the browser on all major operating systems. They also anticipate future expansion will include other components involved in rendering media files. \"If the initial tests go well, then Firefox could apply this to all the image, video and audio formats that the browser supports,\" Shacham said. \"The hope is that at some point, bugs in all of those libraries become useless for hacking Firefox. And if that happens, then user security would be greatly improved.\" Over time, as more parts of the browser get these improvements and are incorporated into versions on more operating systems, it could improve security for millions of users worldwide. There are roughly 250 million monthly active users of the Firefox browser on desktop computers. \"Defects happen,\" said Eric Rescorla, Firefox CTO at Mozilla. \"To keep our users secure on the internet, we need to ensure that a single programming error cannot easily compromise the browser. To date the industry's approach to this problem has been very coarse-grained, which limits its effectiveness. We're very excited to bring the new level of isolation provided by RLBox to our users.\" Other co-authors on the papers are UC San Diego graduate student Craig Disselkoen; Mozilla engineers Nathan Froyd and Eric Rahm; Stanford research associate Tal Garfinkel; and UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering Department professor Sorin Lerner.

Texas Computer Science is committed to educating tomorrow\u2019s top leaders in technology and staying ahead of the trends that guide how businesses operate. To meet the needs of our students and prepare them for their future careers, we\u2019ve launched the Texas Honors Computer Science and Business (Texas CSB) program . Texas CSB is a four-year, integrated honors degree between the Department of Computer Science and the Canfield Business Honors Program . The breadth and quality of information the program provides appeals to a wide range of students with varying career aspirations, including data analytics, marketing analytics, financial engineering, and leadership roles in tech companies. It was the program\u2019s focus on developing both technical skills and business savvy that made Austin Joseph, a first-year UT Austin student and Texas CSB cohort member, excited to apply. On speaking about his motivations for joining Texas CSB, Joseph said, \u201cOne thing I really want to do is start my own company by my junior or senior year. Since I want to create a quantitative finance group, I need make sure I have a strong understanding of computer science and finance\u2026 I thought [Texas CSB] was the perfect way to merge those things.\u201d He then added, \u201cThe classes are challenging but I can already see my growth as a programmer and as a person.\u201d In the first year alone, the program has garnered the interest of many talented students\u2014in total there were 409 applicants. Admittance into Texas CSB was based on a holistic evaluation of a student\u2019s leadership qualities, academic achievements, and passion for the fields of business and technology. The inaugural class comprises a group of 23 exceptional students who uphold UT Austin\u2019s reputation for academic excellence while reflecting the increasingly broad landscape of computer science. The cohort possesses an impressive academic background, with the group\u2019s median SAT and ACT scores being 1560 and 36, respectively. Texas CSB also touts more female students in admittance than the national average for other computer science programs. Another Texas CSB member, Julia Hathaway, attended Lake Travis High School and was the school\u2019s 2019 valedictorian. At that time, she said that she wanted to work in the realm of computer science but also \u201creally love[d] working with people\u201d and wanted to incorporate that into her career. Ultimately, she applied to Texas CSB because she identified with the program\u2019s goal of preparing students to work in roles \u201cwhere you have the technical skills, but [also] have the background in business to take on more managerial roles or be an entrepreneur.\u201d By combining the degrees, which are already recognized as ranking among the top ten programs in their respective fields, students are able to complete their education in a shorter amount of time, as opposed to those who pursue separate degrees in the two colleges. This integrated approach is fostering a new generation of leaders that have both the technical knowledge and business acumen to tackle modern, pressing issues.

Photo credit: University of Texas at Austin. In a sign of the highly competitive environment for top talent in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the Sony Corporation this week tapped Peter Stone, a faculty member in the College of Natural Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, to lead the newly established Sony AI in the United States . Stone, the David Bruton, Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science at UT Austin, will continue to teach and direct Texas Robotics and the Learning Agents Research Group in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at UT Austin, in addition to his new role at Sony AI's U.S. division. He is associate chair of the Department of Computer Science and oversees an inter-college consortium of robotics groups across campus whose external partners include the Austin-based Army Futures Command (AFC). The move is part of a growing trend. As the demand for technologies using artificial intelligence booms, giants of industry and the public sector, from Google and Facebook to AFC, are increasingly turning to university researchers for their unique expertise. \"The mark of a top-tier university in artificial intelligence is whether you have this kind of connection to industry,\" said Don Fussell, chair of the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. \"In this field, it is only the leading R1 universities whose faculty are asked to run industry research labs.\" \"The University of Texas remains my home base, and I am excited both to assume this new role and continue the research and teaching I do at UT,\" Stone said. \"Although the new lab does not have a campus affiliation, there is no doubt that the opportunities the university affords have a lot to do with why Sony's AI research hub for the United States is now led by someone right here in Austin.\" Stone is not alone in bridging academia and industry. Inderjit Dhillon , a professor of computer science and director of the Center for Big Data Analytics at UT Austin, also works in the Amazon Research Lab in Berkeley, California, where he is developing and deploying state-of-the-art machine-learning methods for Amazon Search. Meanwhile, UT faculty often continue to work with members of the university community while assuming roles in industry; for example, Kristen Grauman , a professor of computer science at UT Austin who specializes in computer vision and machine learning and who is on leave to work at Facebook AI Research, recently co-presented at a major conference with her graduate student on a project they collaborated in developing. Universities and industry both see dual appointments as a way to mitigate a possible danger to the core missions of both. If industry recruits top researchers from academic posts, it makes it harder for the next generation of researchers to receive an education and learn the craft from the field's leaders. This is essentially \"eating their seed corn,\" as Fussell explained to the New York Times last January . For four years, Stone served as president and co-founder of an AI startup, and his prior work in industry included a stint as senior technical staff member in the AI principles research department at AT&T Labs \u2013 Research soon after he completed his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University. Stone's research interests include planning, machine learning, multiagent systems, robotics and machine learning (especially reinforcement learning). He is the president of the international RoboCup Federation and the recipient of numerous research and teaching awards, including being named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow, Guggenheim Fellow, AAAI Fellow, IEEE Fellow, AAAS Fellow and University Distinguished Teaching Professor.

    "text_content": "DJ-MC: A Personalized DJ | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content DJ-MC: A Personalized DJ Posted by Angela Schiff on Thursday, January 9, 2020 There are few pet peeves worse than being unable to find the right song. It\u2019s this endless cycle of shuffling through a music library that inspired UT alumni and faculty to create DJ Monte-Carlo (DJ-MC)\u2014a program tailored to preemptively pick music that suits your mood. Elad Liebman, now a Texas Computer Science alumnus, was pursuing his PhD under the advisement of Dr. Peter Stone when he thought of creating a program that would work as a personal DJ. In conjunction with McCombs School of Business data scientist and professor Maytal Saar-Tsechansk , Liebman designed DJ-Monte Carlo. The program\u2019s architecture is built around the idea that the overall music session matters more than a singular song. Every element of the audio works in tandem to create a music listening experience that reflects both the listener's mood and taste at any given time. The \u201cMC\u201d in DJ-MC comes from the program\u2019s deployment of a Monte Carlo search: a term used in machine learning for a mechanism that tests different combinations and selects the best option found within a finite amount of computation. DJ-MC picks the next best song to play based on the current playlist while still planning and testing new music sequences, thus using a Monte Carlo search. Take a typical music streaming platform. While many can understand your song preferences\u2014like the ones you play on repeat in the shower\u2014they\u2019re not great at understanding which songs would best fit your current emotional state. The algorithm tends to recommend songs by similar artists while ignoring other songs that contain similar musical components, such as pitch, tempo, and how a song transitions into the next. However, those elements are integral to creating a cohesive sequence that complements a person\u2019s preferences during a given music session. It\u2019s more efficient to consider the progression and flow of music within the context of the playlist, rather than analyzing each song individually. What makes DJ-MC more akin to a human DJ than an algorithm is that it adapts to listener likes and dislikes, changing with their mood. The team found that using a real-time reinforcement model was the key to developing a playlist that suits the ever-changing mood of a music listener. When a song plays, the program analyzes its audio information while the listener rates how much they enjoy the song. DJ-MC then uses that information to generate thousands of possible sequences and predicts which one the user will like most. It plays the next song on the playlist and while taking the listener's real-time feedback into account and generates even more sequences. \u201cThe Right Music at the Right Time: Adaptive Personalized Playlists Based on Sequence Modeling\u201d was published in the Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ) journal in September 2019.

    "text_content": "Computer Scientist Weighs in on Quantum Supremacy | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Scientist Weighs in on Quantum Supremacy Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, October 28, 2019 College of Natural Sciences News by Grace Dickens Google announced earlier this week they reached a milestone achievement of \"quantum supremacy,\" or the creation of a quantum computer capable of calculations beyond the capacity of a traditional supercomputer. To put this in perspective, a number of media outlets (including New York Times, Scientific American , Nature , Quanta Magazine , BBC and NPR ) relied on the expertise of Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. In the paper they published in the science journal Nature , Google said their computer completed a certain mathematical calculation in under four minutes -- a task that would take a supercomputer over 10,000 years. But technology company IBM, which has also been looking into quantum computing technology, said Google's timeframe of 10,000 years is overstated. IBM said a supercomputer they developed, Summit, could perform the same calculation in 2.5 days. Aaronson believes IBM may be right, he told Quanta Magazine. Aaronson reviewed Google's paper before publication. Aaronson also said on his blog that as the number of quantum bits increase -- the basic unit of quantum information -- so do the number of problems a quantum computer can solve. Google's quantum computer runs on 53 quantum bits, but according to Scientific American, it would take one million bits for a general-purpose machine. Although it may not be as groundbreaking as previously thought, Aaronson told the New York Times and Scientific American that this is still a major breakthrough. \"The original Wright flyer was not a useful airplane,\" said Aaronson in an interview with the New York Times. \"But it was designed to prove a point. And it proved the point.\" This announcement from Google also raised an issue with the public, though. Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang tweeted his concern that quantum computing will make password encryption useless, but Aaronson refuted these claims on his blog, stating that the technology required to break cryptosystems doesn't exist yet. Aaronson came to UT Austin in the summer of 2016 as the founding director of the Quantum Information Center , and also as the David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science. He spent nine years as a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT before coming to UT Austin. News Categories Faculty Industry Relations Research Tags Quantum Computing",

Though his profile isn\u2019t the traditional image of a college student, his background is not uncommon. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs , \u201cover 1,000,000 student Veterans are using their G.I. benefits to pursue advanced educational opportunities, and this number is estimated to increase by 20% in the next few years.\u201d Eakin is one of many student veterans who are using their benefits to further their education. His journey to Texas Computer Science, however, wasn\u2019t serendipitous: It was years in the making. When he graduated high school, Eakin was certain that immediately enrolling in college wasn\u2019t the best choice for him. Unsure about postsecondary education, Eakin enlisted in the Marine Corps. At the time, Eakin had no idea that he would eventually attend UT Austin. As he reflected on the decision years afterward, Eakin remarked that he was drawn to both institutions for similar reasons. \u201cThe military was appealing to me in the same way UT was appealing because [of] the challenge aspect of it,\u201d he said. Once enlisted, Eakin served in California working primarily as a low altitude air defense gunner. After that, he went on a special duty assignment overseas for three years as an embassy guard. Eakin found himself working as an embassy guard in various cities such as Berlin and Cairo. During this time, he found a burgeoning interest in computer science. Recalling what attracted him to computer science, he said \u201cat first I was wanting to know how it all works...now it\u2019s more of a creative thing because you can do so much with it. From graphics to web stuff, it\u2019s just so cool to me.\u201d He found that the more he learned about programming, the better he was able to work on everyday problems. \u201c[Computer science] teaches you how to take problems and break them down into smaller parts that are more doable.\u201d He watched videos about learning to code on YouTube. \u201cFrom there, I went down the rabbit hole...I started to fall in love with coding.\u201d Eakin also began to speak with the embassy employees who worked in IT. They encouraged him to pursue computer science, Eakin remembered. \u201cThey were telling me that I should go for it because I had an interest in that field, even before I started college.\u201d Eakin explored the world of coding by making several apps and decided to formally study computer science once he left the military. After five-and-a-half years of service, Eakin moved to Houston, where he grew up and where his family lives, and attended a community college there before transferring to UT Austin in 2018 as a computer science major. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to be the best at what they do?\u201d Eakin said when asked about why he decided to apply to The University of Texas. Many people can find the rigor of university coursework overwhelming at first. Even Eakin, who had years of professional experience and a background in programming, found it to be demanding. Still, he manages by following a single, blunt-yet-efficient life mantra: \u201cJust get through it.\u201d For Eakin, difficult tasks are an exercise in learning to manage the rougher aspects of life. This can be traced back to his time in the Marine Corps. \u201cThe Marine Corps introduced me to the roughness of the world at a young age. Not everyone is going to be nice to you, especially in the workplace. There are other things too, like getting things done...meeting deadlines was a big thing in the Marine Corps, and that carried over a bit.\u201d He added that while some mindsets carried over from the Marines, he had to unlearn certain mentalities. \u201cYou tend to catastrophize in the Marine Corps...like every little thing is a big deal. You can\u2019t have that same mentality at UT...there\u2019s going to be bad grades, there\u2019s going to be missed deadlines. You have to learn to cope with that.\u201d Despite the difficult course load, Eakin finds that he enjoys his computer science classes. \u201cI\u2019m learning cool things that I would have never probably ventured upon in my own learning.\u201d In addition, he has secured a summer internship with Lockheed Martin in New Mexico, where he will be doing system work and working on testing equipment. The University of Texas at Austin has various resources for student veterans. Along with campus outreach and mental health services, there is also the Student Veteran Association for those looking for an on-campus community. Eakin has found a group of fellow student veterans whom he feels comfortable spending time with. \u201cHere at UT, the veterans have get-togethers every week. They\u2019re kind of like my crew,\u201d he said. News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags veterans G.I. benefits veteran resources",

    "text_content": "Exploring the Intersection of Computing, Law, and Ethics | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Exploring the Intersection of Computing, Law, and Ethics Posted by Tracy Zhang on Tuesday, April 30, 2019 TXCS wants students to consider the ways in which the laws are evolving to adapt to massive tech growth as well as examine the further ethical implications of their work. There is a certain \u201cgrow fast or die slow\u201d paradigm in the present-day computing industry. Software and technological innovations are in a period of massive growth and flux\u2014change is so rapid that even today\u2019s laws are lagging behind. Texas Computer Science and Texas Law professors argue that under current circumstances, it is also important to consider the ways in which the legal field is evolving to adapt to these technological changes as well as examine the further ethical implications of computing. Legal protection for software currently lies in a growing area somewhere between patent and copyright law\u2014subcategories under the umbrella of intellectual property\u2014a field that deals with the legal rights and authorship of creative works and inventions. However, patent law is currently more focused on tangible and hardware-based creations. For example, machinery, robots, and internet of things devices\u2014rather than the more conceptual algorithms or abstractions often associated with software programs. Furthermore, a patent in the US protects a creation for 20 years after its initial filing date, but it can take two to three years for a patent application to be approved. With the speed that new applications and programs develop, a patent would not issue for software or algorithms until well after it is no longer applicable. Karen Landolt , J.D. Assistant Professor of Instruction in Computer Science and Business, Government, & Society, said, \u201cJust try to think of a program that has been around for 20 years. These are extremely rare. Different versions [of programs] come out even in a two or three year period. The same goes for various operating systems too\u201d. Copyright law is increasingly the best area of law to protect software and, according to Landolt, it is beneficial for programmers and engineers to be aware of these changes. Technology and law are more closely linked than most think and these areas need to cooperate for optimal development. Aside from inventors and creators, the rise of complex software systems also leads to legal challenges for users. For example, in regard to artificial intelligence systems in self-driving cars, the US Department of Transportation wrote that the government would interpret artificial intelligence in a self-driving car as a valid and legal \u201cdriver\u201d. In this respect, interesting questions like \u201cWhat laws should be in-place to protect users of these technology products?\u201d, \u201cWhat regulations should be placed upon them?\u201d, and \u201cWhat are the rights of users?\u201d arise. Regardless, laws and legal regulations are just general guidelines\u2014they do not resolve the broader, and perhaps more fundamental, ethical questions. \u201cJust because something is legal doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ethical,\u201d said Landolt. At TXCS, students are increasingly being challenged to go beyond coding and engineering. The department wants to help them develop a core understanding of ethics as well. \u201cWe have to understand the pervasive effects of technology and think critically about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said TXCS Professor Alison Norman . Norman currently teaches a course called \u201c Ethical Foundations of Computer Science ,\u201d which introduces first-year students to real-world ethical dilemmas and how to approach them. She hopes that this will allow students to draw parallels to problems they may encounter working in technology and find principled and constructive ways to go about solving them. \u201cIt\u2019s not that most people are unethical\u201d, said Norman, \u201cIt\u2019s more that people haven\u2019t thought about ethics deeply or found they even have the right to care\u201d. With these types of courses, students have practice thinking about these things. The department is now considering adding ethical case studies to the curriculum of various required computing courses. \u201cThe goal is to create different scenarios and to be intentional about hitting all areas\u201d said Norman, regarding the importance of ethics in the context of a computer science education. While Norman has proposed to integrate ethics directly into the computer science curriculum at UT, Landolt hopes to educate more indirectly, merging service and experiential learning into her teaching. In her \u201c Behavior Ethics in the Digital Age \u201d course for TXCS undergraduates, students collaborate with nonprofits to create technology solutions for real-world challenges. \u201cMy hope is to teach them to be ethical decision-makers,\u201d she said. In the end, it just benefits everyone when people are informed and intentional about what they\u2019re doing regardless of their field, both legally and ethically. In the meantime, TXCS is actively working towards this\u2014helping to educate and shape the next generation of conscientious inventors and programmers alike.

Some of the most mysterious behaviors in the animal kingdom\u2014like parenting\u2014evolved over thousands of years, if not longer. Human lifespans are just too short to sit and observe such complex behaviors evolve. But computer scientists are beginning to offer clues by using artificial intelligence to simulate the life and death of thousands of generations of animals in a matter of hours or days. It's called computational evolution. Point of Discovery \u00b7 Artificial Intelligence Revs Up Evolution\u2019s Clock One behavior that's long baffled biologists is called mobbing, in which a gang of hyenas team up to steal prey from much more powerful lions. When UT Austin computer scientists Risto Miikkulainen and Padmini Rajagopalan simulated hyenas and lions on a virtual African savannah, they found something surprising.

Tom Griffin) - https://freesound.org/people/pogmothoin/ TRANSCRIPT Marc Airhart: This is Point of Discovery. Today, I've got a special treat. I'm handing over the reins of the podcast to our science writing intern, Cason Hunwick. He explores what artificial intelligence might teach us about how hyenas in Africa evolved a surprising hunting tactic. Along the way, you'll learn about an area of computer science called computational evolution, where machines evolve solutions in response to complex problems\u2014and a lot more quickly than we living things can do. Cason spoke with computer scientists Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen from The University of Texas at Austin. Cason Hunwick: Imagine you're in a grassy African savannah, the sun's hanging low, just about to set, but then \u2026 you hear a lion. You look over and see a lion standing over a zebra carcass. There's blood and torn, striped flesh in its mouth. It's clear that the hunt is over and this \u2013\u2013 is dinner. But wait \u2026 a spotted hyena has just approached the lion, hoping to do what you just thought was impossible and steal some of the lion's kill. It lunges for the zebra carcass. But the lion makes a precise, powerful strike and sends the hyena screeching and running. Of course, for a solo hyena to try this is pretty foolhardy and in attempting to steal prey from the lion, it could easily become it. CH: But in groups, spotted hyenas have found a way to steal the kill and walk away without a scratch \u2013\u2013 scot-free, full stomachs. They group up and execute a coordinated attack on the lions, in a cooperative behavior known as mobbing. Back on the savannah, let's listen in as a collaborator of two UT computer scientists, Michigan State University professor of integrative biology Kay Holekamp, looks on at the behavior. She is joined by a member of her lab, Erin, who provides the play-by-play in this recording of a successful mobbing event in Kenya. Erin counts the approaching hyenas ... Erin \u2026 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. Fourteen hyenas. CH: Two more join and it becomes a frenzy \u2026 Erin: There's a mob, kind of circled the lions \u2026 they've all clustered up over there Cason: And finally, they all rush together \u2026 Erin: They've driven off two of the lions. Oh! They got the carcass! Nice guys. CH: Mobbing has been the subject of study for decades, because it's something of a mystery. Hyenas behave instinctually -- and yet they find strength in numbers. Enough hyenas together can overpower the stronger predators. But how does this behavior evolve? University of Texas at Austin computer science researchers Padmini Rajagopalan and Risto Miikkulainen studied this question. Padmini Rajagopalan: We can't study evolution in action, in the real world, the only way we can really do it is in simulation. CH: That's Rajagopalan. She says evolution is just too slow to observe. Plus, you can't look back in time. Instead, you have to simulate how hyenas' behaviors may have developed over the generations. To accomplish this task, Rajagopalan started out with 100 randomly generated learning algorithms -- they're sort of like stands in for those early hyenas' brains ... And out of this first generation of 100 \"blank slate\" artificial hyenas, Rajagopalan randomly selects ten of them, assigning the task to mob the lion. Now at least four of them will need to rush the lion simultaneously and if they run in too early, they die. If they come in after the lion is mobbed, they get less food. PR: This way, I test many different\u2026 teams of 10 hyenas. Once I've done that, I look at the population of hyenas and see which were closest to what I wanted them to do. CH: Many other teams of computerized hyenas from each generation are tested and run through these trials. The hyenas that \"survive\" get to \"reproduce.\" PR: So what I mean by that is I mix up their little codes and get new hyenas that hopefully have some of the best characteristics. CH: The ones with higher fitness levels have more offspring. This mimics how the behavior evolved in real life. Hyenas that behave in ways that are beneficial then survive to mate and pass on their traits, while those that behave in ways that hurt their chances of survival and mating are less likely to pass on their traits. Repeating this selection, testing and reproduction for 1,000 generations happens a lot faster on a computer than in real hyena lifetimes. PR: In the initial generations, we saw other behaviors emerging. There was this risk-taking behavior where the hyena just went straight to the lion, attacked the lion all by itself and died. And there were these risk-averse hyenas which stayed far away from the lion waiting for it to be driven away. So they avoided death but they also didn't get much reward. Slowly, over the next few generations we saw that mobbing emerged as a kind of combination of these behaviors. Both the risk-averse and the risk-taking. CH: So, in other words, mobbing arose out of two kinds of impulses the hyenas developed: \"I don't want to die\" and \"I want the reward.\" But then, Rajagopalan saw something unexpected. Those two extreme behaviors on each end of the spectrum: rushing in and dying, or waiting around the periphery, those did not go away. PR: Those behaviors I mentioned that emerged early, like the simple behaviors of attacking the lion by themselves or waiting around far away and never really participating in the mobbing event, these behaviors still tended to stick around even though I evolved the hyenas for a very prolonged period. So the mobbing behavior itself did emerge within the first ten generations, but I kept the evolution going for 1,000 generations and still these other behaviors did not go away. CH: Why did they stick around? Computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen who was Rajagopalan's advisor for the work, asked the same question. And, he offered an explanation. Risto Miikkulainen: But why would they stay around? You would think that hey now they have a successful mobbing that just takes over the whole population everybody does the same thing. But you don't see that in biology, I mean, in all kinds of societies you see a persistent minority and we saw it here as well. And that was a surprise but after the fact we can explain it. Let's say that now there's a new species or new group of lions that are much, much stronger for some reason. So now it's really good to have hyenas that are less bold and the species survives and they develop a better strategy. CH: And, similarly, if lions became weaker, being that fearless go-it-alone hyena might start to pay off with big rewards. CH: Now, Miikkulainen explains that while these simulations are useful, they won't entirely replace field work in the real world. RM: Computational simulations can always give you suggestions or insights or proposals on what to look at. But the actual verification still has to be done in the discipline itself. CH: So thankfully, biologists and computational scientists aren't in opposition. Scientists can use technology in some constructive back and forth. Biologists find something interesting in the field \u2013\u2013 maybe in cells or primate behavior \u2013\u2013 and computer scientists study it in theoretical space, returning to the biologists a suggestion for what to look for in the field, in real life. For example, in mobbing, the UT computer scientists may ask field researchers if they observe those two hyena behaviors that stuck around in the simulations: maybe if they see a hyena lurking far away and joining only after the mobbing has ended, or if they see that brave hyena rushing in alone and risking its life. In this way, both groups need each other. And there are plenty of fields this new kind of artificial intelligence \u2013\u2013 computational evolution it's called \u2013\u2013 could help. Any field that involves complex problem solving can benefit from systems that evolve solutions to problems. But Miikkulainen again makes it clear that the technology isn't meant to replace humans. RM: We are talking about machine creativity and machines coming up with surprises and solutions that humans won't think about. But it's still a tool for humans. It's an extension of their thinking.

    "text_content": "Using Neural Networks to Personalize Treatment for Bilingual Aphasia Patients | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Using Neural Networks to Personalize Treatment for Bilingual Aphasia Patients Posted by Muhammad Muhdhar on Monday, October 11, 2021 Bilingual aphasia is a language impairment to multilingual people acquired through some sort of injury, usually a stroke. Patterns of language impairment in multilingual stroke patients are very diverse. Sometimes language impairment affects all languages the person speaks equally, while other times it affects one language more than the other. The way in which a stroke affects a multilingual patient depends on many different variables such as when each language was learned, how frequently each one is used etc. This makes creating treatment of multilingual victims of stroke much more difficult. In their latest research, UT professor Risto Miikkulainen and research scientist Uli Grasemann , among others, explore how neural networks could be used to model language patterns and create personalized treatment. Uli Graseman met Risto Miikkulainen, a UT Computer Science professor specializing in cognitive science, during his undergraduate years in an exchange program. Upon completing his undergraduate degree he went back to Germany, eventually deciding to come back to UT Computer Science to earn his PhD. He graduated with a PhD in computer science in 2010. Dr.Graseman then worked as a data scientist for a few years before returning to UTCS as a research scientist. Neural networks are a subfield of machine learning that are designed to mimic the functions of the human brain. They recognize patterns in a subset of data and then use what they have learned to predict outputs in a new set of data. As the name implies, neural networks are made up of a network of neurons that are organized in layers and built to share information with one another. Because they are modeled after how the brain operates they can be useful in understanding how the human mind works. More specific to this study, neural networks can be used to model human linguistic abilities. A neural network map can be created to demonstrate exactly how an individual human\u2019s language patterns are arranged. For example, if someone speaks more than one language that can be reflected in a neural network map.They can be as detailed as creating maps that reflect which language is a person\u2019s native language, when they learnt a new language, and even accurately represent how similar the two languages are. In the same way that neural networks can be used to create language maps specific to an individual, parts of them can also be destroyed to reflect how a stroke affected a specific person. In \u201c Predicting language treatment response in bilingual aphasia using neural network-based patient models \u201d Uli Grasemann, Risto Miikkulainen, and their collaborators at Boston University explore how neural networks could be used to create personalized treatments for stroke patients. After identifying a stroke patient, they model a neural network specific to the patient\u2019s linguistic abilities. Upon doing so they destroy parts of this neural network according to how the stroke affected this specific patient. Then the researchers try different treatment methods to see which is most successful. This technology allows for the creation of treatment specific to stroke patients that suffer from bilingual aphasia. So far this study has focused on bilingual patients that speak Spanish and English. One of the things the researchers have learnt is to figure out which language to use in treatment, when the right language is used in treatment the other language also improves. The neural network model allows researchers to try multiple different treatments in minutes to figure out the best approach for treatment. Though this specific study focuses on strokes, this type of innovation can be used to treat language impairment from other conditions as well. This is a part of a current trend in medicine to use computer science to personalize treatments for patients. As Dr.Miikkulainen put it, \u201cThis is where all of medicine is going\u2026 when they say a drug is 70% effective that means it doesn\u2019t work for 30% of people. That\u2019s because people are different. We are trying to take these differences into account and create individualistic customized treatment that's most effective for you.

Credit: Jamie Wynder /Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0). An artificial intelligence system made history recently by beating a human world champion in Sony's popular video racing game, Gran Turismo Sport. The technological feat, which made the cover of the journal N ature , involved an AI system designed in part by three University of Texas at Austin computer science Ph.D. alumni and professor Peter Stone. Stone, who holds the David Bruton, Jr. Centennial Professorship in Computer Sciences #3, is director of Texas Robotics and executive director of Sony AI America. His co-authors on the paper included UT alumni Sam Barrett, Piyush Khandelwal and Patrick MacAlpine. The system has been dubbed Gran Turismo Sophy, or GT Sophy. The team used an approach called deep-reinforcement learning to design the system, which is a machine learning approach in which a system repeats an action or task over and over until it perfects it. In this case, GT Sophy played Gran Turismo for 45,000 hours until it learned how to consecutively win races in the game. \"It's a huge milestone for the advancement of robotics,\" Silicon Hills News summarized after interviewing Stone. In speaking to other reporters about the work, Stone reflected on whether implementing GT Sophy in self-driving cars may be next. He explained to the Texas Standard that those represent two very different types of machine learning tasks: \"The goal of this project was to win in the video game setting. It would be another sort of level of challenge to take it out onto real cars; it would be really exciting to do that. But this reinforcement learning learns from a lot of experience, and when it does, it has to make mistakes. And that's something that's fine to do in a video game. [But] you don't want the car crashing into a wall in the real world while it's learning.\" Stone explained that a more immediate application of the work would be implementing aspects of the system in robots to improve human detection or to help human drivers in a real-world setting learn some of the same lessons that the machines learned to avoid collisions and win in competitions. \"One of the most exciting challenges of our time is how can we use AI to enhance what people do,\" Stone said in reports. \"We are using AI to augment human capabilities rather than to replace them.\" Cross-posted from CNS News Read more: An Artificial Intelligence Agent with Development Ties to UT Austin Defeats Human Drivers in Sony's Gran Turismo Video Game , Silicon Hills News How an AI system beating a video game could lead to better autonomous vehicles , KUT's Texas Standard News Categories Alumni Research Tags Artificial Intelligence Peter Stone Sam Barrett",

Fuller/National Science Foundation Original story by Marc G Airhart , College of Natural Sciences The University of Texas at Austin's Scott Aaronson is an initial member of a new multi-institution collaboration called the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Present and Future Quantum Computation. The institute will work to overcome scientific challenges to achieving quantum computing and will design advanced, large-scale quantum computers that employ state-of-the-art scientific algorithms developed by the researchers. Aaronson, the David J. Bruton Centennial Professor of Computer Science and director of UT Austin's Quantum Information Center , is one of the world's leaders in theoretical quantum computing. As part of the institute, he and his team will do fundamental research on the themes of quantum algorithms and quantum advantage. Unlike conventional computers, quantum computers seek to harness the mysterious behavior of particles at the subatomic level to boost computing power. Once fully developed, they will be capable of solving large, extremely complex problems far beyond the capacity of today's most powerful supercomputers. Quantum systems are expected to have a wide variety of applications in many fields, including medicine, national security and science. On July 21, the National Science Foundation announced a five-year, $25 million award to seven universities to create the new institute: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, the University of Washington and The University of Texas at Austin. The new institute will be directed by UC Berkeley professor of physics Dan Stamper-Kurn. The institute will be multidisciplinary, spanning physics, chemistry, mathematics, optical and electrical engineering, computer science, and other fields and will include scientists and engineers with expertise in quantum algorithms, mechanics and chemistry. They will partner with outside institutions, including in the emerging quantum industry, and will host symposia, workshops and other programs. Research challenges will be addressed jointly through a process that incorporates both theory and experiment. While quantum computers are likely to have an enormous impact on national and global economies and societies in the future, Stamper-Kurn emphasizes that several critical scientific challenges remain. \"We still do not know fully what quantum computers do well,\" Stamper-Kurn said, \"and we face deep challenges that arise in scaling up quantum devices. The mission of this institute is to address fundamental challenges in the development of the quantum computer.\" More information on NSF-supported research on quantum information science and engineering is available at nsf.gov/quantum .

The middle panel shows a previous approach for solving this problem, that fails. [Figure from: AmbientGAN: Generative models from lossy measurements, by A. Bora, E. Price and A.G. Dimakis, ICLR 2018.] Advances in machine learning are announced every day, but efforts to fundamentally rethink the core algorithms of AI are rare. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week that it has received a three-year, $1.5 million National Science Foundation TRIPODS (Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science) award to establish a new institute on the foundations of data science. The institute will coordinate foundational research in AI and data science across several university departments, launch a large-scale workshop and signature seminar series, and provide seed funding for a number of graduate and post-doctoral fellowships in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The grant is co-led by Adam Klivans (Computer Science), Sujay Sanghavi (Electrical and Computer Engineering), Purnamrita Sarkar (Statistics and Data Science), and Rachel Ward (Math/Oden Institute), and will involve additional faculty from these departments. \u201cWe are extremely excited to have successfully brought together experts from across four departments for this venture,\u201d Sanghavi said. \u201cOver the years UT has managed to amass significant talent in this important area, but it remains somewhat fragmented across organizational units. This TRIPODS institute will help centralize UT\u2019s expertise in this area via a series of joint initiatives.\u201d The award is the first phase of a multi-step nationwide process to build larger institutes for machine learning and AI, as part of NSF\u2019s Harnessing the Data Revolution initiative. The impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning has exploded in business, science, and society, but many important fundamental questions remain. The Texas institute aims to address these along three themes: developing an algorithmic theory of deep learning; making machine learning robust; and improving graph-based applications. By looking at foundational approaches to analysis and design, the institute will form a central hub for theoretical machine learning and data science research. Current machine learning methods produce models that are enormous and very hard to analyze. Developing a new science to better understand, and hence better train, such models is the first thrust area of this award. \u201cTraining a machine learning model is computationally expensive and deciding how to set parameters is more of an art than a science,\u201d Klivans explained. \u201cThere are no good mathematical underpinnings for how to set the dials and levers. For all we know, we are leaving a lot of performance on the table.\u201d The second thrust is robustness, both to errors in the data and to deliberate adversarial manipulations. \u201cThe current model of relying on vast amounts of spotless training data is untenable in most applications. As people try to use machine learning models for high-stakes applications, this problem will be exacerbated by attempts to attack its reliability,\u201d said Sanghavi. The UT team will design systems that are less-easily deceived. \u201cDeveloping robust machine learning models will be key to their wide deployment,\u201d said Klivans. The final research thrust will explore graphs \u2014 a mathematical way of capturing interactions between individual units or nodes \u2014 and apply new approaches to questions in neuroscience, including searching for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, ADHD, or autism based on changes in brain connectivity. \u201cA main focus will be on developing provable, scalable, and robust methods for large biological networks,\u201d said Purnamrita Sarkar. \u201cA very important part of developing a large-scale AI or ML systems is to quantify and estimate uncertainty, because without that, one can in fact make disastrous decisions in this era of big data.\u201d UT has one of the most esteemed and widely-published faculty in the area of AI and machine learning. The award will give UT researchers time and space to work together on some of the most pressing fundamental problems in the field, and in the process make large gains in AI performance. The TRIPODS faculty will leverage the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) for building algorithms at scale. Beyond the work of the individual researchers, the new institute will engage undergraduates, especially women and underrepresented minorities, in research; support the undergraduate Machine Learning and Data Science club; contribute to a new portfolio program in machine learning; and generally, create a more fertile environment for AI research on campus. \u201cThe PIs have a strong track record for engaging women and minorities in research. For example, the very successful Rising Stars Workshop for women graduates in computational and data sciences was successfully organized by one of the PIs at the Oden institute last year,\u201d said Sarkar. \u201cThe new institute will contribute funding and participants to the upcoming 2020 Rising Stars conference as well as future years.\u201d Successful TRIPODS projects will be eligible to apply for Phase II of the project which will provide $10 million awards to a handful of institutes. \u201cMachine learning is changing the world and has become a core tool across all the sciences. I think future progress in science will be dependent on how well we as a community do machine learning,\" Klivans said. \"This grant positions UT to take the lead on these challenges.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Faculty Press Release Research",

The software was developed by members of the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory , including aerospace engineering senior Gavin Martin, Carson Schubert, electrical and computer engineering junior, Nihal Dhamani, computer science and astronomy senior, and Pratyush Singh, electrical and computer engineering senior. The satellite, called Seeker 1, is part of a NASA project to design small spacecrafts that can fly around larger ones carrying humans to conduct damage inspections or provide servicing capabilities, Martin said. In this mission, the Seeker satellite will perform specific maneuvers around the Northrop Grumman Cygnus Cargo Delivery Spacecraft, the large vehicle carrying cargo to the space station, Martin said. \u201cIt is a technology demonstration mission to prove that (Seeker 1) can safely do the motions necessary for a small spacecraft to inspect larger and more expensive spacecrafts,\u201d Martin said. While the launch is today, the Seeker 1 demonstration will take place this summer once the resupply mission is complete and the Seeker and Cygnus spacecrafts are a safe distance apart from the Space Station, Schubert said. The team\u2019s software sends information to various navigational sensors on Seeker 1 to help it maneuver, Martin said. \u201cOur software lets Seeker 1 recognize Cygnus, the target spacecraft, and its location in relation to Seeker 1,\u201d Martin said. To train their software to identify and locate objects in space, the group used a 3D modeling software to create pictures of the target spacecraft, said Singh. \u201cWe made pictures of Cygnus in various space conditions such as an Earth background or black background,\u201d Singh said. \u201cWe also made other images containing a non-Cygnus spacecraft so that the (software) could learn to accurately identify Cygnus.\u201d After training the software, it was able to detect Cygnus with 96.5% accuracy, Martin said. Schubert said ultimately, these satellites can be used to improve the safety of future space exploration. \u201cFor example, there are handrails that astronauts use while doing their spacewalk on the Space Station,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cBefore the actual spacewalk, astronauts are sent out just to inspect the rails for damage. Now, small spacecrafts like Seeker could autonomously do these damage inspections before humans are sent out.\u201d NASA will use this mission to continue developing these small spacecrafts, Schubert said.

On Sat, 9 Nov 2019, the UT Programming Team won the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) South Central USA Regional Competition at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. The winning team, consisting of Aditya Durvasula ('19), Aaron Lamoreaux ('23), and Viraj Maddur ('23), will compete in the ICPC World Finals this coming June in Moscow, Russia. The competition consisted of 60 teams from 25+ schools (approximately 180 students) from across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. UT Austin's top team solved 12 of the 12 problems. UT Austin's other three teams came in 3rd (Aditya Arjun, Kevin Li, Luke Gretta), 4th (Jake Crouch, James Dong, Kevin Chen), and 6th (Alex Hong, Davis Robertson, Tres Brenan). UT has been competing in the regionals since 1997. This is UT's fourth consecutive win. UT went to the 2016 world finals in South Dakota, the 2017 world finals in Beijing, and the 2018 world finals in Portugal. UT has seen marked improvement since the creation of a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming , taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing, in conjunction with the student officers of the UT Programming Contest. The ICPC traces its roots to 1970 when the first competition was hosted by pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to raise increase ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities of the strongest students in the field of computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the contest has expanded into a worldwide collaborative of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world\u2019s universities. The ICPC is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation and is headquartered at Baylor University.

Credit: Melanie Gonick Water, sunlight, nutrients\u2014these ingredients are essential for plant growth. However, these basic ingredients don\u2019t always yield the ideal plant. In fact, optimizing these variables is complicated, causing some plants to fall flat on flavor. Machine learning can help. In a study published in PLOS ONE, researchers from Texas Computer Science and MIT\u2019s Media Lab modified these variables and others with the goal of producing basil with stronger flavors. By doing this, researchers hoped to understand how to both improve and automate farming. Unlike many other farming optimization efforts, this process didn\u2019t involve genetic modification. Instead, researchers combined cyber-agriculture, metabolomic phenotype (chemotype) measurements, and machine learning to yield a crop of flavorful basil. Flavor might seem like a minor factor in optimizing food production, but according to researchers, the molecules that determine flavor in plants are typically correlated with positive health benefits, carrying antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, as nutrient quality in produce has decreased over time, so has flavor. \u201cPlants have gotten bigger and they don\u2019t have all the nutrients they used to have,\u201d said Risto Miikkulainen , a TXCS professor and a researcher in the project. \u201cOur research has shown that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d Researchers manipulated variables in retrofitted shipping containers that allowed them to control conditions like sunlight, temperature, and humidity. If you\u2019ve heard of urban or vertical farming, this method is similar. They found that basil had optimal flavor when exposed to visible light for 24 hours a day\u2014an unexpected conclusion considering few plants are naturally exposed to this much sunlight. Miikkulainen attributes this surprising discovery to the absence of human biases. \u201cNature is no longer really relevant in this sense\u201d Miikkulainen said. \u201cWe discovered basil doesn\u2019t need to sleep, so if you take your constraints from nature, they might not really be that useful.\u201d Miikkulainen and his colleagues came to this conclusion with the help of machine learning. \u201cMachine learning doesn\u2019t have the same biases as humans,\u201d he said. While this research may excite pesto-lovers, it has even greater implications for the future of food security. According to researchers, cyber-agriculture has important applications in adaptation to climate change and medicine. Using cyber-agriculture, we can hopefully one day create plants that are resistant to changing climate conditions. Furthermore, Miikkulainen said this machine learning model will allow us to determine the efficacy of different combinations of variables without wasting resources or time. \u201cIn many optimization tasks, what you\u2019re trying to discover is very expensive to evaluate. In the case of basil, it\u2019s a minimum of three weeks that we have to wait to discover if the recipe is effective (without our model)\u201d Miikkulainen said. But with this surrogate model, farmers can one day determine which conditions yield the desired produce simply by asking the model. \u201cWe can predict pretty well what happens when you have a new recipe, and we tested something like a million recipes with the surrogate, but only a few hundred with the growth experiments.\u201d Miikkulainen said. The future of food production requires innovation. Researchers at TXCS and MIT are working to meet this need through exciting new technology that allows us to envision the future of food\u2014intelligent computers and big flavor.

    "text_content": "UT Partners with SparkCognition to Host Data Mining and Analytics Competition | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Partners with SparkCognition to Host Data Mining and Analytics Competition Posted by Tiana Woodard on Tuesday, June 18, 2019 Two hundred and forty Texas Computer Science students recently participated in a data mining and analytics competition hosted by SparkCognition, an Austin-based enterprise artificial intelligence company with software solutions that help clients analyze complex data, reveal actionable insights, and identify and automate optimal responses. The company awarded scholarship prizes to the first, second, and third place winners of $10,000, $3,000, and $2,000 respectively. This competition was included in the curriculum for \u201cIntroduction to Data Mining,\u201d taught by Angela Beasley , Assistant Professor of Instruction at Texas Computer Science. In groups of four, students enrolled in the course teamed up to build data mining applications designed to tackle issues faced in everyday life. Students participating in the competitions used SparkCognition \u2019s model building platform Darwin, a machine learning (ML) product that accelerates data science by automating the building and deployment of models. \u201cIt is a truly unique opportunity for students and the company alike,\u201d said Beasley. By participating in this competition, students will gain real-world experience in applying these techniques and learn the power of using machine learning to make better-supported decisions. \u201cThe best ways to learn data mining is to use your own data set in an experimental way. I can tell you what to do, but the best way is not coached through,\u201d said Beasley. Each team presented their project to a panel of SparkCognition executives, who graded on the impactfulness and creativity of the team\u2019s application. The first-place winner of the competition built an application around Darwin with the intent to solve the increasing issue of media bias. The application was able to take any website or article and assign it a sensationalism and media bias score to determine what was written with the intention to excite readers versus to objectively inform the reader and share factual accounts.The first runner-up developed an application that was able to take data points from facial scans and images to identify and predict the mood of an individual. This was followed by the third place winners, who used data to determine what drives the first impression in a relationship and use the data to predict whether or not people would match on a dating service. In addition to introducing the competition to other universities, Bruce Porter , who serves as both a Texas Computer Science professor and Chief Science Officer for SparkCognition, plans on continuing the program with future UT students. Porter has also stated that he hopes this event is the start of a lasting, fruitful relationship between SparkCognition and Texas Computer Science. \u201cI hope that (the competition) will be an incentive for students to think and challenge themselves on really serious, hard problems and then to be rewarded for their hard work. These kind of projects where the students are able to find their own project, something they personally create. And to pursue that with vigor \u2014 that's what these kind of competitions can provide,\u201d said Porter.

Intelligent mobile robots that can answer questions, give directions, complete tasks, and walk us through an ever-changing world\u2014these robots could one day make more static technologies like Alexa, Siri, and GoogleHome look outdated. Unbeknownst to many, robots of this caliber are being developed by our very own Texas Computer Science faculty and students in the Gates Dell Complex (GDC) right now! These are the robots that will shape the future of the Texas Computer Science experience all while contributing to the growing field of artificial intelligence. More specifically, this pursuit, called the Building-Wide Intelligence Project , is housed-at and maintained-by a group of researchers in the Artificial Intelligence Lab on the third floor of the GDC. Established in 2014 by Texas Computer Science Professor Peter Stone, the BWI Project merges the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence in an aim to create robots that are both helpful guides for visitors on campus and useful platforms for groundbreaking research. The researchers working on this project are a diverse group, including professor and faculty overseers and involving postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students. Together, they work toward a common goal\u2014to develop fully autonomous mobile robots that will eventually become a permanent part of the GDC environment. In other words, Stone states, \u201cWe want people to just walk into the GDC and expect to see robots\u2014getting more used to being around them, having them not just see robots as novelties\u2014with this project, we can see that slowly happening.\u201d Currently, these robots, also called BWIBots, can perform a variety of tasks. For example, they can answer a multitude of questions related to the Computer Science Department or the GDC building. They can also roam any given area without collision, avoiding both walls and moving obstacles, which may sound simple, but is in actuality, a convoluted process in which the robots create and use navigational planners to move. They also act as guides for visitors to the building, giving directions using an internal map or even leading people directly to the rooms they are looking for. Thus, the BWIBots can localize themselves using information from the environment around them. The bots can also identify common objects and fetch them for visitors. Furthermore, they can follow people around and recognize familiar faces. Meanwhile, Stone is most excited about the natural-language capabilities of the BWIBots. He is working with other computer scientists who work on natural language processing, such as Prof. Raymond Mooney, to create more genuine interactions between the robot and humans. Stone says, \u201cit\u2019s really amazing because not many groups in the world have access to both capable robots and world-class expertise in natural language.\u201d Aside from natural-language learning, the functionalities on the robots are related to a wide array of other computational research areas, including but not limited to: reasoning, planning, human-robot interaction, computer vision, localization, and multi-robot coordination. All these areas intertwine and work together in a complex and beautiful way to make even the most seemingly-simple tasks possible. The robots are also unique in that they are, as Stone says, \u201ccustom built\u2014from a hardware-perspective. They have very specific capabilities like [the earlier mentioned] activity recognition, semantic mapping, and others\u201d In the past, the BWIBots have participated in a variety of events, including ExploreUT (the largest open house in Texas) and the 2015 AAAI Conference robotics exhibition. They are also used in the Autonomous Intelligent Robots Stream in the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) Program which aims to provide undergraduate students with a real-world research experience. Additionally, since the start of the BWI project, the robots have been used for experiments and demonstrations in 24 research publications. Stone states since the BWI Project \u201cdoubles as a research project and educational program, the capabilities [of the robots] really depend on the particular set of people working on it currently and their interests.\u201d Right now, Stone is working on multi-agent systems research, in other words, getting the robots to communicate and interact with one another. Social experiments are also being performed with the BWIBots to investigate people\u2019s different viewpoints on robots and to study human-robot interaction. Results and feedback from these experiments will then be used to further improve the BWIBots. From elevating our understanding of artificial intelligence to paving the way for the emerging future of assistive mobile robots, the BWIBots are here to stay. These robots will continue to improve, growing in functionality and efficiency, as they gradually become integrated into the GDC environment, and eventually, the overall Texas Computer Science experience News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Research Undergraduate Students Tags Building-Wide Intelligence Project Peter Stone Research Gates Dell Complex Freshman Research Initiative ExploreUT",

This campaign will support Texas Computer Science one-week residential summer camps that allow students to experience Texas Computer Science before they even apply to UT. One of these camps is First Bytes, a program for girls in their junior and senior years of high school. First Bytes aims to dispel myths about computer science and expose young women to a future career in computing. At First Bytes, participants are encouraged to use their problem-solving and reasoning skills to explore a variety of jobs in computer science. They work in collaborative teams, visit research labs, and learn about the newest technologies and innovations. Jacqueline Gibson, a First Bytes alum, said that First Bytes was a transformative experience that allowed her to create a network of other women in computer science before even starting college. \u201cFirst Bytes redirected the trajectory of my academic career and my life. Now I have found my passion, and for that I am forever grateful,\u201d Gibson said. Another camp, Code Longhorn, provides high school students from historically underrepresented groups with exposure to programming concepts, and allows them to practice using computers to solve real world problems. This camp has team-building activities with educational and recreational sessions as well. Chris Nunes, a Code Longhorn alumni, said that Code Longhorn really helped him discover his passion for technology. He said, \u201cI had the chance to talk to students and professors who could tell me exactly what it was like to study computer science \u2026 Seeing these people and seeing the amazing Texas Computer Science facilities really was the biggest factor in drawing me to this field, and I made friends that I still have today.\u201d Together, these two camps have been successful in inspiring young computer scientists like Gibson and Nunes to join Texas Computer Science, and have helped create a more diverse student body, which is a positive trend. NCWIT reports on a number of studies that indicate that teams that are more diverse show more positive outcomes Texas Computer Science is invested in continuing this trend, even to the extent of asking donors to support its diversity initiatives, like these camps. Currently Texas Computer Science wants to grow capacity for these camps to serve even more students and shape a new generation of computer scientists.

On Sat, 10 Nov 2018, the UT Programming Club won the ICPC South Central USA Regional Competition at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. The winning team, consisting of Ethan Arnold ('19), Ryan Rice ('19), and Supawit Chockchowwat ('20), will compete in the ICPC World Finals this coming April in Porto, Portugal. The competition consisted of 70+ teams from 25+ schools (approx. 225 students) from across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. UT Austin's top team solved 11 of the 12 problems, more than any other team. UT Austin's other three teams came in 2nd (Aditya Durvasula, Jake Crouch, James Dong), 4th (Davis Robertson, Ho-Jae Jung, Kevin Chen), and 8th (Kevin Li, Lucas Gretta, Ritvik Annam). UT has been competing in the regionals since 1997. This is UT's third consecutive win. UT went to the 2016 world finals in South Dakota and the 2017 world finals in Beijing. UT has seen marked improvement since the creation of a new elective, CS104c : Competitive Programming, taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing and the student officers of the UT Programming Club. The ICPC traces its roots to 1970 when the first competition was hosted by pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to raise increase ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities of the strongest students in the field of computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the contest has expanded into a worldwide collaborative of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world\u2019s universities. The ICPC is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation and is headquartered at Baylor University. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The contest has raised aspirations and performance of generations of the world\u2019s problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering.

This is a visualization of predicted storm surge on the Louisiana coast caused by Hurricane Laura, the Category 4 Atlantic hurricane that struck Texan shores earlier this year. Credit: Computational Hydraulics Group, Oden Institute. Source: College of Natural Sciences Many of the decisions we make are now guided by computational simulations, from designing new spacecraft to predicting the spread of a pandemic. But it's not enough for a simulation model to just issue predictions. A decision-maker needs to know just how much those predictions can be trusted. This is the objective of research in the critical area of predictive science, which is about to take a major step forward at The University of Texas at Austin. The Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences has been selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center, with the mission to develop the next generation of exascale predictive simulation capabilities. The center will support the research of dozens of scientists, post-docs and students, and will foster close collaboration with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Bob Moser and George Biros from the Oden Institute and UT's Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering are leading the team of 18 faculty and senior researchers from six different departments, which also includes a faculty member from Texas State University. The new center is part of the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) and this is just the third time that PSAAP centers have been awarded by the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) since the program's inception in 2008. UT Austin was one of only four institutions nationwide to be selected to establish a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center. \"This shows the power of collaborative research and how it allows us to take on grand challenge problems,\" Moser said. \"The challenging research agenda called for by the DOE can only be achieved by drawing on strengths across campus in computational science, computer science, physics modeling, uncertainty quantification and physical experiments.\" The team includes three members of the College of Natural Sciences: Keshav Pingali , a professor of computer science, Chris Rossbach , an assistant professor of computer science, and David Hatch, a research scientist at the Institute for Fusion Studies. The group will focus on developing predictive simulations of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) torch in unprecedented detail. These torches have many applications, from advanced manufacturing to destruction of hazardous waste. Currently, an ICP torch experimental facility developed at UT Austin is being used to test materials for use on future spacecraft. Simulating the torch, however, is a means to a greater end. \"It is a way to achieve the primary objective of the center: advancing predictive science capabilities,\" Moser said. Oden Institute researchers will develop capabilities for predictive modeling and simulation of the plasma torch, while researchers from the Cockrell School of Engineering will conduct physical experiments. A key goal of the project is to combine the power of simulation and experiment to improve predictive capability. The center's capacity to advance predictive science is enabled by the supercomputing power and expertise available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Using systems such as TACC's Frontera (the world's most powerful academic supercomputer) in tandem with the DOE's high-performance computing systems, the new predictive science center will also advance exascale computing: the next generation of the most powerful high-performance computing systems. \"TACC's exceptionally powerful computing resources will enable us to design and test novel exascale algorithms,\" Biros said. \"We anticipate discoveries in computer science, HPC and computational science that could have a profound impact on large-scale simulations, especially on advancing more reliable predictions of complex systems.\" UT Austin's new PSAAP III center is being supported through a $16.5 million DOE cooperative agreement over five years.

    "text_content": "Computer Science to Launch Online Master's Degree | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science to Launch Online Master's Degree Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, October 9, 2018 The University of Texas at Austin is making plans to bring its top-ranked computer science graduate program to students and professionals beyond campus through a new online master\u2019s degree program . Pending final approval by UT System and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the university will partner with online learning provider edX to make UT\u2019s Top 10 computer science master\u2019s degree available to students around the world, affordably and on their own schedule. The degree largely mirrors the curriculum faculty members teach to UT Austin\u2019s on-campus master\u2019s degree students in computer science. The university expects the program to be of interest for working professionals and students seeking to improve their career opportunities in the fast-growing technology sector. \u201cOur objective is to make sure that students have access to one of the most in-demand degrees in the modern economy,\u201d said Don Fussell , chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201cWhen you look at the lists of the highest-paid and most in-demand positions, they\u2019re dominated by computational skill sets. This online master's degree allows many more students to compete for those jobs and to make a contribution to the economy.\u201d While an increasing number of universities have moved to offer online coursework, UT Austin is one of the only universities to take a top-ranked computer science master's program fully online at a broadly affordable cost. As planned, the top-10-ranked degree program will be available to students with an estimated price tag of $10,000. To qualify for the 30-credit-hour program, students should have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a related field. If the program is approved, applications will be accepted in spring 2019, with the first class of students enrolled for fall 2019 classes. Demand for well-trained technology professionals is increasing, particularly in Texas, which has seen record growth in this area. According to a projection by the nonprofit Code.org based on Bureau of Labor Statistics and National Science Foundation data, there will be 1 million more computing jobs than qualified applicants by 2020. By comparison, that\u2019s more than double the current tech talent gap of 500,000 vacant positions, which is already considered a significant challenge for the industry. \u201cWe are arguably the strongest computer science program within a thousand miles,\u201d said Adam Klivans , associate professor of computer science and faculty director of the new program. \u201cWith this program, we have removed geographic barriers entirely and significantly lowered the cost barrier. For someone who lives in the Rio Grande Valley or West Texas or for someone who has a job that they\u2019re trying to hold but wants to advance their career, this is a game changer.\u201d The program offers the professional development required or recommended for many positions, including the opportunity to concentrate in high-demand specialty areas such as machine learning or cloud computing. Program leaders anticipate that the new degree will attract students who might not otherwise consider UT Austin, for example, because they are unwilling or unable to leave their jobs to pursue an advanced degree on campus. Previous studies of online computer science master\u2019s degree programs from highly ranked institutions found that participants in online learning programs proved to be excellent students, though at a different stage of life than many students who apply for on-campus degree programs. Online students were more likely to be older and working professionals. For more details on the program, including information on how to apply, click here .

Their group, led by Texas Computer Science professor Peter Stone, includes Shih-Yun Lo, a Texas Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, and Shiqi Zhang, a former Texas postdoc student and current Assistant Professor at SUNY Binghamton. Task planning involves orienting the robot's actions around goals and subgoals and is especially challenging in large-scale indoor environments as it requires calculating the locations of people, objects, and their respective interactions within the environment. Optimal task planning will ensure that efficient assistive mobile robots are not a distant reality. AAMAS brings together experts in the field of agent technology, providing a forum for both researchers and practitioners of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.

This UT Team Thinks It\u2019s Possible | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Could Robots Compete in the 2050 World Cup? This UT Team Thinks It\u2019s Possible Posted by Julianne Hodges on Thursday, July 26, 2018 Photograph courtesy of JT Genter. By Rachel Cooper, The Alcalde For the past month, the world has been watching national soccer teams from across the globe compete in a surprising and nail-biting World Cup. Although the U.S. didn\u2019t make the cut for the 2018 version of the quadrennial tournament, there\u2019s an unorthodox soccer team close to home that did pretty well on the international stage\u2014a group of Longhorns and their goal-scoring robots. In Montreal from June 18-22, UT\u2019s robot soccer team, UT Austin Villa , competed in the 22nd annual RoboCup competition, which began with a goal of developing a robot soccer team capable to beat the human World Cup champions by 2050. UT has competed in the annual competition since 2003, using computer science to code robots and running thousands of computer simulations in the hope of one day achieving this goal. Computer science professor Peter Stone has been involved with RoboCup since its founding in the mid \u201990s, and is now president-elect of the International RoboCup Federation. Stone formed UT Austin Villa (a play on the English soccer team Aston Villa) when he arrived at UT and has been the leader of the team of mostly graduate and PhD students ever since. Stone says while the organization\u2019s goal of competing robots with humans might be a dated idea, he still hopes to see it achieved one day. \u201cIt\u2019s very ambitious and we\u2019re not close to it yet, but there\u2019s still 30 more years and things change very rapidly technologically in our day and age,\u201d Stone says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet too much on it happening, but I also wouldn\u2019t bet too heavily against it.\u201d The original event that began in 1997 focused on robots in soccer, and has now expanded to more than 10 different leagues, with competitions outside of soccer. Currently, UT competes in the Standard Platform League, the 3-D Simulation League, and RoboCup@Home that focuses on robot service capabilities in the domestic realm. Even with the growth of RoboCup, Stone says soccer remains the focal point. The league closest to standard soccer that UT competes in is the Standard Platform League, which uses roughly 12-pound, 2-foot-tall humanoid NAO robots to play a five-on-five game of soccer. The robots shuffle slowly around a miniature field, kicking the ball and falling over regularly. UT became champions in this league in 2012, and this year, the team was knocked out right before the semifinals, finishing in the top eight. This was the ninth year of competition for team member Katie Genter, PhD \u201917, who was drawn to UT partly because of the university\u2019s involvement in RoboCup. Genter is part of the executive committee for the Standard Platform League, where she helps develop the league and introduce more complex aspects of the game in preparation for real play, some of which seem ambitious with the league\u2019s current state of slow and fumbling movements. \u201cThis year we put free kicks into the games, but next year we may put corner kicks, or throw-ins, or maybe try to get the league toward having passing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s very few teams that do passing right now, but that\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s going to need to come in to gameplay as we move to bigger fields and to playing more intelligent opponents.\u201d Recently, UT has been successful in the 3-D Simulation League, where coded humanoid robots play a simulated, yet physically realistic, virtual match. The team has won the competition seven out of the last eight years, which Patrick MacAlpine, PhD \u201817, a post-doctoral fellow who has been leading the team since 2010, says is largely due to machine learning. This aspect allows the computer to learn new behaviors for the simulated robots\u2014simple actions such as walking, kicking a ball, and even getting up from a fall have proven a crucial advantage for the team. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve developed the basic abilities, we\u2019re at the point where we can start thinking more about strategy and coordination among the robots,\u201d MacAlpine says. \u201cI\u2019d like to start applying more machine learning, not just to the low-level skills for our robots, but actually high-level strategy. That\u2019s something we really started to do this past year.\u201d RoboCup is held every year, giving teams frequent chances to keep improving and competing. However, MacAlpine says the years the competition coincides with the World Cup are more exciting\u2014this year the competition took place during the group stage of the World Cup, and MacAlpine recalls the fun in being able to watch matches with natives from different countries. The international community created in both tournaments is a centerpiece of the competitions, as teams from all over the world bring in different perspectives and strategies to the same game. UT is one of just a handful of U.S. teams represented at RoboCup, and Genter says being able to compete internationally is one of the best aspects. \u201cI love getting to meet and create pretty lasting relationships with a lot of the other teams,\u201d Genter says. \u201cYou see them once or twice a year, but you\u2019re all working toward the same problem. You have people that are doing their PhDs in Germany, Iran, Chile, and all over the world, and you\u2019re coming together for this one goal.\u201d News Categories Faculty Graduate Program Graduate Students Research Tags Artificial Intelligence robotics RoboCup autonomous robots Peter Stone UT Austin Villa",

Their paper, \u201c AIM: Acoustic Imaging on a Mobile ,\u201d demonstrates a method of acoustic imaging that can be used on a normal smartphone without requiring extra hardware. Instead of light, acoustic imaging uses ultrasound, or sound waves with frequencies too high for humans to hear, and is often used in medical applications to see internal body structures. Acoustic imaging complements the camera-based imaging found on smartphones because the sound waves can detect objects in the dark, penetrate through many materials and even propagate around obstacles. Using an off-the-shelf Samsung Galaxy S7, the researchers were able to identify objects in black trash bags and under clothing using acoustic imaging.

    "text_content": "Scott Aaronson Awarded Tomassoni-Chisesi Physics Prize for Quantum Computing Research | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Scott Aaronson Awarded Tomassoni-Chisesi Physics Prize for Quantum Computing Research Posted by Julianne Hodges on Friday, August 31, 2018 UT computer science professor Scott Aaronson is a recipient of the prestigious 2018 Tomassoni-Chisesi Award from the Sapienza University of Rome Physics Department for his research in quantum computation. Aaronson received the award for his contribution to defining the fundamental limits of quantum computation and his research at the frontier of computational complexity and quantum mechanics. Quantum computers are a completely different type of computers that rely on the rules of quantum mechanics, a set of fundamental laws of physics with strange rules that is most noticeable in certain conditions such as at subatomic scales or very cold temperatures. Although they are currently relatively simple and research is still ongoing, more complex quantum computers that could be built in the future are thought to be more powerful than traditional computers at solving certain types of problems. During the award ceremony at the Sapienza University of Rome on September 13, Aaronson will deliver a seminar discussing some of his work in quantum computing over the past 18 years. The seminar will cover three questions about quantum computing: will the quantum computers of the near future be significantly faster than traditional computers, what kinds of problems would be hard even for quantum computers, and are there any possible models of computation that would be even more powerful than quantum computers? The Tomassoni-Chisesi Award is an international prize given by the Sapienza University of Rome to honor the memory of Caterina Tomassoni and Dr. Felice Pietro Chisesi and is intended to recognize outstanding achievements in physics. The award was originally two separate prizes and were first awarded in 2001, but in 2013 the two prizes were combined into the Caterina Tomassoni and Felice Pietro Chisesi Prize . This year\u2019s Tomassoni-Chisesi Award was given to two researchers; the other winner is professor Philip Kim from Harvard University, a world-leading scientist researching nanoscale materials. Kim was chosen for his experiments on quantum transport in carbon nanotubes and graphene. Previous award winners have made fundamental contributions to research fields such as quantum mechanics, particle physics, cosmology and theoretical physics.

    "text_content": "First Bytes Creates Community and Career Opportunities for Women in Tech | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content First Bytes Creates Community and Career Opportunities for Women in Tech Posted by Julianne Hodges on Monday, July 30, 2018 Former campers, Texas Computer Science alumnae and HomeAway software engineers, Tiffany Tsai (left) and Cassie Schwendiman (right), credit First Bytes with helping lead them on their path to computer science. More than just a summer camp for creating memories and making new friends, First Bytes opens up a wide variety of opportunities in computer science for high school girls and helps build a community of women in the tech industry. First Bytes is a free, one-week annual summer camp offered by the University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science intended to break misconceptions and introduce computer science to high school girls. Two former campers, Texas Computer Science alumnae and HomeAway software engineers, Tiffany Tsai and Cassie Schwendiman, credit First Bytes with helping lead them on their path to computer science. When Schwendiman was in high school, she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of career she wanted to pursue; she was interested in art but uncertain about going to art school. She took a programming class during her junior year of high school \u201con a whim\u201d and discovered that she really liked programming. That summer, she decided to go to First Bytes, and \u201cthe rest is history.\u201d For Schwendiman, realizing that computer science can be used for a wide variety of fields appealed to her because she could spend more time figuring out what she wanted to do before knowing exactly what kind of career path she wanted. \u201cThe message (from First Bytes) that resonated with me was that you can use computer science for literally anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe visited people from IBM and very traditional tech companies, but we also had some people from medical industries, some people from video gaming. They made it very clear that, if you went into UTCS, you could really go into anywhere.\u201d Similarly, First Bytes helped Tsai realize that she could work in computer science. She also took a computer science class in high school, but before attending First Bytes she never felt like computer science was meant for her; she didn\u2019t feel as passionate about it as her classmates, and she believed that having an intense dedication to coding was the only way to be a software engineer. \u201cIn high school I didn\u2019t know what to do, I didn\u2019t have any striking passions,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cAt First Bytes, I realized the opportunity in computer science and how there are so many different fields and how there can so much variety in your work. I remember laying in bed at the dorms in Jester (thinking), I could really major in computer science.\u201d Another benefit of First Bytes that Tsai found was the community that is established among women in computer science and tech. She said having a support network, such as First Bytes and the CS Freshman Pods , can help with the struggles that computer science majors face. When they went on to work for HomeAway, Tsai and Schwendiman found a similar support system among their coworkers and within the culture of the company. For example, Tsai said there are plenty of mentorship programs at HomeAway and the people are easy to meet with. \u201cA higher-up here at HomeAway when I was an intern really made me feel like she was available to talk about concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cAt HomeAway specifically, I feel very supported by community, and being a woman in computer science, I don\u2019t feel pushed out.\u201d At HomeAway, the Women in Tech group is an organization of women and their allies. The group meets monthly discuss the issues they face in computer science, such as the lack of women in tech leadership, Schwendiman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a community to sit around and talk about our problems, but it\u2019s a community that works on building each other up and bringing improvements to the place that we work,\u201d she said. Building these kinds of communities, and showing high school girls with an interest in computer science that they\u2019re not alone and that they have an opportunity to pursue that career, makes First Bytes important and impactful for young women such as Tsai and Schwendiman. Since her time as a First Bytes camper, Tsai has seen more and more female software engineers come speak to the campers. \u201cEven in the industry, I see with an incoming class of new grads there\u2019s more and more women,\u201d she said. \u201cI think First Bytes has really helped facilitate that community and facilitate young girls to say, I can be a software engineer.\u201d Schwendiman added that First Bytes gives these high school girls the experience with technology that they may not receive in high school. This gives them a chance to see what\u2019s behind the technology they use and how they can create their own projects. \u201cIt\u2019s super important for breaking stereotypes, because everyone knows that nerd stereotype that\u2019s in movies, and it\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important for these high school girls to be exposed to great real women out there in tech, because they can put themselves in their shoes and see, \u2018this is what it would be like if I followed in their footsteps.\u2019 News Categories Alumni Industry Relations Outreach Undergraduate Students Tags First Bytes Tiffany Tsai Cassie Schwendiman diversity women in computing",

Companies like Google, IBM & Microsoft already are hard at work attempting to develop quantum computers that can do things today's computers aren't capable o f. The computer science faculty member who advised and recommended the problem to Tang was Scott Aaronson, a leading expert at developing tests for quantum supremacy, so people can know when, in fact, a quantum computer has managed a task no classic computer can. Tang used the problem as a senior thesis topic. By poking holes in a particularly well-known quantum algorithm, which some computer scientists from another institution had famously suggested would require a quantum computer, Tang stumbled on something. The specific and highly challenging algorithm for recommending products to users (much like what Amazon and Netflix use to recommend products or films) is known as the \"recommendation problem.\" As Quanta writer Kevin Hartnett notes: \"Computer scientists had considered it to be one of the best examples of a problem that's exponentially faster to solve on quantum computers \u2014 making it an important validation of the power of these futuristic machines. Now Tang has stripped that validation away.\" A few weeks after graduating, Tang presented the finding, that a classical algorithm could resolve the problem quickly, at a quantum computing workshop with Aaronson in California. The experts in attendance reportedly backed the finding. Aaronson said the problem was tough, and Tang appears to have made more progress toward solving it than any researchers who have tackled it before.

But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer\u2019s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand-in-hand. - \u201cThe Humble Programmer,\u201d Edsger W. Dijkstra (1972) LAFF-On Programming for Correctness presents \u201cgoal-oriented programming\u201d the way Edsger Dijkstra, one of UT-Austin\u2019s most influential computer scientists, intended. The methodology demonstrates that, for a broad class of matrix operations, the development, implementation, and establishment of correctness of a program can be made systematic. Since goal-oriented programming focuses on program specifications, it often leads to clearer correct programs in less time. This approach rapidly yields a family of algorithms from which an algorithm with desirable properties, such as attaining better performance on a given architecture, can be chosen. The free-to-audit, six-week, self-paced course \u201cLAFF-On Programming for Correctness\u201d launches its second offering by UTCS faculty (and spouses) Robert van de Geijn and Maggie Myers on May 15, 2018 on the edX platform. The Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF) online courses connect the theory of linear algebra to issues encountered in computer architecture, software engineering, and program correctness. The LAFF courses build on van de Geijn and Myers\u2019 ongoing research in high-performance linear algebra libraries, exposing participants to cutting-edge research while teaching them the fundamentals of the field.

Starting this fall as a computer science major at UT, Criswell graduated in May from Westlake High School as the president of Westlake\u2019s Latin Club, a National Merit Finalist, a National AP Scholar, and \u201cStudent of the Year\u201d in four of her classes during her junior year. She is the recipient of the Bransford Trust Forty Acres Scholarship, making her a part of the Forty Acres Scholar Program Class of 2022. The scholarship program, administered by the Texas Exes, offers a close-knit community of fellow scholars and provides funding for college and living expenses. This year, nearly 6,500 students applied for the Forty Acres Scholars Program, and Criswell was one of the 21 students chosen. \u201cThroughout the selection process, the words passionate, driven, motivated, and vision were used to describe these students,\u201d said director of scholarships Kristy Parks in the Forty Acres Scholars announcement . \u201cThey will join our diverse scholar community, currently comprised of 70 scholars on campus and 36 alumni, who embody the university\u2019s core values and are committed to UT\u2019s mission of transforming lives for the benefit of society.\u201d With Longhorn parents, a sister who will be a junior at UT and a cousin who graduated from the Turing Scholars program, and after living in Austin for most of her life, Criswell always saw herself attending UT. \u201cI was always wearing burnt orange, and by just learning more about the college through the college application process, I really saw what made it so great, and that made me want to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the people who I\u2019ve met at UT are amazing. They\u2019re so smart, they\u2019re so dedicated, they\u2019re so kind, I feel like the whole experience is going to be great all around.\u201d She is excited about the opportunities available at UT\u2019s computer science program and is looking forward to being a part of the Turing Scholars program and participating in research. \u201cWith Turing and with Deans and with Forty Acres, there are going to be so many great opportunities at UT to just go out there and do things and get that hands-on experience and make that impact, and I\u2019m so excited about that,\u201d she said. In her sophomore year of high school, Criswell first learned to program with Java in a computer coding class before she had a personal laptop or any advanced knowledge of computers. \u201cI really started making my own code \u2026 and eventually it got to be just me sitting down at a computer and making my own program,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018computer, do this,\u2019 and then the computer would do the thing, and I was like, \u2018Yes! I can do the thing!\u2019 It was such a proud moment to build something and create with just your own power.\u201d After that, she took a second and third year of computer science classes. Most recently, she has been working on a game design and graphics project. \u201cNow I\u2019m doing independent study practice at my high school, so it\u2019s just 50 minutes a day sitting down and writing a coding project that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d she said. Through Dean\u2019s Scholars , Criswell will take chemistry and biology classes and is considering double-majoring in mathematics. She also wants to \u201ctest the waters\u201d of the pre-med program in order to combine her interests in computer science and the medical field. Although she is not yet entirely sure what kind of research she wants to do or where she wants to go with computer science, Criswell is looking forward to learning and discovering her passion while at UT. \u201cI don\u2019t know where computer science will take me, but mixing (computer science and medicine), they seem to complement each other so well,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what I think my plans are, but I know college is a huge time for change and discovery, so they\u2019re not set in stone.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors Undergraduate Students Tags Abby Criswell Turing Scholar Dean\u2019s Scholar Forty Acres Scholarship",

The Association for Computer Machinery\u2019s annual SIGMOD/PODS conference is a major gathering of database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to discuss and learn about cutting-edge tools and techniques. Big data management, which deals with large databases, often requires finding relationships between different data items. The relationships between items can represent a graph , making graph data analysis important for extracting information from the data. The mission of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) is to provide benchmarks , or ways to compare a technique\u2019s effectiveness to the industry\u2019s best practices, for graph database management, as well as help users who manage data better understand their graph data problems and explain the pros and cons of the various options available for managing databases. The Technical User Community (TUC) meeting is a one-day event held before the 2018 SIGMOD/PODS conference, which this year starts on June 10 in Houston. For the past several years, a group of around 30 researchers have gathered at the TUC meeting to less formally discuss graph data management before the main conference. With talks from LDBC members and other participants, the TUC meeting gives the database research community an opportunity to learn about how the LDBC task forces are working on benchmarks to evaluate graph data management, give feedback on this work, and hear about user experiences with graph data management technologies. Registration is free but required, and the meeting will take place in the GDC from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. News Categories Events Tags Daniel Miranker Big Data Association for Computer Machinery",

    "text_content": "Computer Scientists Receive $1.7 Million Grant to Make Chip Design Easier | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Scientists Receive $1.7 Million Grant to Make Chip Design Easier Posted by Tracy Zhang on Wednesday, October 3, 2018 An \"Asynchronous FPGA chip\" built using the tools Keshav Pingali and his collaborators are developing for DARPA. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Yale University and Texas State University have been awarded $5 million by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of a program designed to spark the next wave of semiconductor innovation and circuit design in the U.S. The UT Austin team is led by Keshav Pingali , a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the W.A.\"Tex\" Moncrief Chair in the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) . The overall goal of DARPA's IDEA/POSH program is to greatly reduce the resources, expertise and time it takes to develop new chips. Demand for System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms has remained strong but the cost to design these platforms has increased to a point where smaller companies often do not have the resources to design these circuits for specialized applications. That leaves it to a few large corporations to fill the demand - and little room for innovation. To correct that, DARPA formed the Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI), which brings together researchers from academia, commercial industry, and the defense industrial base to address today's SoC design complexity and cost barriers. The IDEA/POSH program is one of several programs started by DARPA under this initiative. UT Austin will receive a total of $1.7 million over four years. Pingali's group will work with Yale and Texas State to develop parallel electronic design automation (EDA) software for building computer chips. He says that the proposed software will be unique in several ways. First, the tools will target both synchronous and asynchronous circuit designs. Systems with synchronous circuits are the industry standard but with this approach, a system can run only as fast as the slowest function that is supported. Systems with asynchronous circuits on the other hand allow each function as little or as much time as needed to complete its task, so the system works more efficiently taking only as much time as necessary rather than the time taken by the slowest function. The new project will address the needs of both communities. Second, the software will be designed to run on multicore and manycore parallel processors, including processors with graphics processing units. \"Chip designs have become so complex that the only way to shorten design cycles is to exploit parallel computing,\" Pingali said. In previous research funded by DARPA and NSF, Pingali's center developed a parallel programming system called Galois, which makes it easier to write parallel software for multicore and manycore platforms. This system will play a key role in the new project. \"The EDA industry has recognized the need to parallelize their software for a while now,\" Pingali said, \"and they refer to this as EDA 3.0. Our new project brings together experts in EDA tools and parallel computing to make EDA 3.0 happen.\" News Categories Awards & Honors Faculty Research Tags Keshav Pingali",

    "text_content": "Teaching Computers to Read with Machine Learning | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Teaching Computers to Read with Machine Learning Posted by Angelica Lopez on Thursday, November 1, 2018 The internet is a vast network of knowledge, containing the sum of humanity\u2019s greatest accomplishments, algorithms, and stories. However, accessing this information usually requires the critical eye of a human user. Greg Durrett, a Texas Computer Science Assistant Professor, is using statistical machine learning to change just that. Under the broad scope of natural language processing, one of Durrett\u2019s interests is \"entity identification,\" or \"figuring out who the actors are in a given text and how they relate to each other.\u201d  For example, phrases like \u201cPresident Obama,\u201d \u201cBarack Obama,\u201d and \u201cthe former president,\u201d are all word sequences that have the same meaning. While this might be obvious to the user, computers often don\u2019t recognize these similarities. Durrett's research teaches computers how to identify subtle nuances of natural language. In addition to identifying common entities, his model also links the actors in a given text to their respective disambiguated Wikipedia pages. The model gathers and applies background knowledge and contextual tools, like a human would, to understand the difference between Texas longhorns (the breed of cattle), and Texas Longhorns (the football team). This end result, probabilistic models coupled with a practical application, is a portrait of Durrett's passion for natural language processing. \"What led me to NLP was machine learning, and its applied areas are this nice intersection of concepts from math and probabilistic modeling and optimization,\u201d Durrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s also very applied so you still get to build something that produces something cool at the end of the day. I really like that synergy. \" Durrett believes that the current trend in NLP is deep learning. Durrett said that innovations in neural network research and their applications to language processing have enabled great strides in tasks like automatic summarization. This is the technology that enables Google to translate text into different languages, and the technology that will continue to allow researchers like Durrett to drive innovation in the near future. Durrett\u2019s research will allow us to one day have more advanced automated systems that can recognize the intricacies of the human language for even smarter data processing and organization.

The competition consisted of teams from 140 regions (approx. 420 students) trying to solve 11 problems in 5 hrs and 20 min. The first-place team, Moscow State University, solved 9 problems. UT solved 4 problems and tied with 42 other teams for 56th place. Teams consist of three students. The students on the UT team were Arnav Sastry ('18), Ethan Arnold ('19), and Daniel Talamas ('18); the faculty coaches were Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing . UT qualified for the world finals by winning the South Central USA region, which includes Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana and includes over 60+ teams from 25+ schools. UT has been competing in the Regionals since 1997, and places in the top 5 almost every year. In 2014, one of our four teams took 2nd place at the regionals. In 2015, one of our four teams took 2nd place again, but all four of our teams were in the top seven. In 2016, our four teams swept the regionals with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place. Qualification for the world finals this year followed a concerted effort to improve UT's performance at the contests, including the creation of a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming , taught by the faculty coaches and club officers. The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world's universities. The ICPC is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation, enjoys the auspices of ACM, and is headquartered at Baylor University. For over four decades, the ICPC has grown to be a game-changing global competitive educational program that has raised aspirations and performance of generations of the world's problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering. In ICPC competitions, teams of three students represent their university in multiple levels of regional competition. Volunteer coaches prepare their teams with intense training and instruction in algorithms, programming, and teamwork strategy. Several ICPC universities and ICPC volunteers provide online judging systems to all free of charge. Top teams from regional competition advance to the final round. This year's regional competitions advanced teams to the World Championship round - the 2018 ACM-ICPC World Finals hosted by Peking University - which was conducted on 19 April, 2018 in Beijing, China. The ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at Texas A&M in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The idea quickly gained popularity within the United States and Canada as an innovative initiative to raise the aspirations, performance, and opportunity of the top students in the emerging field of computer science. The contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first Finals held at the ACM Computer Science Conference in 1977. Operating under the auspices of ACM and headquartered at Baylor University since 1989, the contest has expanded into a global network of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the ACM-ICPC World Finals. In the past 20 years alone, ICPC participation has increased by more than 2000%. Last year, ICPC Regional participation included 49,935 of the finest students and faculty in computing disciplines from 3,098 universities in 111 countries on six continents. A record 53,446 students and 5,411 coaches competed in ICPC and ICPC-assisted competitions last year, setting new records in participation. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

Popularly known as the NSF CAREER award, this is NSF's most prestigious award in support of early-career faculty \u201cwho have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization.'' Don Fussell, the Trammell Crow Regents' Professor and Chair of the UT Computer Science department, said he was delighted but not surprised by the large number of UTCS faculty who won the CAREER award this year. \"Like other top-10 CS departments, we usually get just one or two CAREER awards a year,'' he said. \"This year, four of our junior faculty have won CAREER awards and two have won Sloan awards, which reflects the quality of our recent hires and the strong commitment to computer science by the University administration.'' Fussell said he was particularly happy that the new CAREER awardees span a broad range of research areas from computer systems to robotics and theory, reflecting the strong research programs at UTCS in all areas of computer science. Professor Vijay Chidambaram, director of the UT Systems and Storage Lab (UTSASLab), is being recognized for work on building robust infrastructure with high performance to meet the demands of big-data applications. His current projects, which are funded by VMware, Facebook, and the National Science Foundation, include improving the performance of Ethereum, and building storage systems with new technologies such as Phase Change Memory. His Ph.D. dissertation won the SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Dissertation Award in 2016, and he has won Best Paper Awards at the FAST conference in 2017 and 2018 . Professor Scott Niekum is the director of the Personal Autonomous Robotics Lab (PeARL) , which aims to enable robots to be deployed in homes and workplaces with minimal intervention by robotics experts. His research focuses on the development of machine learning algorithms that can learn efficiently and safely from interactions with humans and experiences in the world. He has collaborated with Silicon Valley robotics companies Willow Garage and Bosch to develop algorithms that enabled a robot to learn to assemble IKEA furniture from human demonstrations. He was the co-leader of Team UT Austin Villa, who won 3rd place in the 2017 Robocup@Home Domestic Standard Platform League, an international robotics competition focused on mobile manipulation and human-robot interaction. Professor Simon Peter is the director of the UT Austin Systems Research Consortium , which is working closely with industry to shape the future of cloud computing. His current research includes co-designing the networking and storage stacks with new hardware technologies to push server I/O efficiency an order of magnitude beyond today's capabilities, and it is supported by VMware, Microsoft Research, Huawei, and Google. He was awarded the Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award at the OSDI conference in 2014 and 2016, and his work is being recognized this year with a Sloan Award as well. Professor Eric Price has done ground-breaking studies on how algorithms can produce more accurate results with less data. Two themes of his research are adaptivity, where initial data can guide future data collection, and signal structure, where a structural assumption such as from sparsity or deep learning can yield provable improvements in sample complexity. His research was featured in Technology Review\u2019s TR10 list of 10 breakthrough technologies of 2012 , and his Ph.D. dissertation won the George M. Sprowls Award for best Computer Science thesis at MIT. Professors Chidambaram, Peter, Niekum, and Price join nineteen other past and present members of the UT Computer Science faculty who have won NSF CAREER awards.

Photo by Jennifer Reel. UT College of Natural Sciences News | Annie Zhang | March 26, 2018 The UT Game and Mobile Media Applications (GAMMA) program was established six years ago upon a simple principle: humans like to play. \"Play is actually how we do everything to advance our lives, including in science,\" Paul Toprac , associate director of GAMMA, said. \"We seem to forget about this idea of play when educating people, but games are a structured way of thinking about play.\" GAMMA, a collaboration between the College of Natural Sciences, the College of Fine Arts and the Moody College of Communications, is an undergraduate certificate program that prepares students for careers in designing video games and mobile apps. As an interdisciplinary initiative that blends expertise from all three colleges, the certificate program gives students opportunities to apply both computing and creativity toward the production of apps and games that are useful and entertaining. Of the students who have completed the GAMMA program, 93 percent have received jobs within six months of graduation, 90 percent of which are within the student's own major. Students take a series of courses in their respective colleges before coming together in the Capstone course, taught by Toprac. In the Capstone course, students from the three colleges are formed into teams, where they have one semester to develop a game from scratch. \"Although the core of it is the computer science aspect, you can't really make a game without art, design, animation and all these other things as well,\" Toprac said. \"The cool thing is that the programmer has to learn how to talk to an artist, and the artist is going to have to learn how to talk to a programmer. GAMMA really teaches students 21st century skills of communication, collaboration, creativity, commercialization and commitment.\" Computer science senior Adam Leslie, who is currently in Toprac's Capstone course and president of UT's Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS), said the program allowed him to develop the necessary skills for pursuing a career in game development. \"I never seriously considered becoming a game developer before, but I found myself really enjoying the process of creating something and seeing it, and also seeing people interacting with it for their own enjoyment,\" Leslie said. \"The constant innovation in the space of game development and programming in general means there's always something new to learn, which I love, and I find the creative side of things very compelling.\" The course, which is operated like a studio, allows students to better understand the fundamentals of working in the industry. \"The industry really appreciates the work that these students have done, and they're amazed that the students are studio-ready,\" Toprac said. The program also hosts career fairs, through which students can network with different companies in game development. This past summer, Leslie completed an internship with a local virtual reality (VR) startup called FarBridge, through which his latest game was released. \"The career fair was a big help, as it's where I got my internship, and the project-related classes here at UT have made me all around more capable,\" Leslie said. \"The GAMMA program's game capstone course is the pinnacle of that.\" The final products are published online , where anyone can download the games for free. According to Toprac, one of the games have gone on to become one of the highest-rated free games of its genre on Steam, a popular online game publishing platform. Another game was a finalist at the College Game Competition at E3, the premier trade event for the video game industry, and one was named a finalist just this month in the Intel University Games Showcase at the Game Developers Conference, the premier video game professionals event. \"The students want to be proud of the game they make, because they know their names are going to be attached to it,\" Toprac said. \"The students often put in way more hours than they'd normally do for a course because they're in a team, they like the game that they're making, and they all want to make a good game.\" News Categories Faculty Undergraduate Program Undergraduate Students Tags Game and Mobile Media Applications EGaDS Paul Toprac",

This is the most prestigious award in support of early-career faculty. NSF awards this distinction to junior faculty who demonstrate potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. With this award, NSF provides researchers with federal funding, and the opportunity to lead advances in their department and institution. Liu plans to use this award to develop a new framework for computing probabilities, called Stein Variational Gradient Descent. According to Liu, artificial intelligence systems have improved dramatically in recent years, allowing computers to categorize images better than humans and make intelligent recommendations for everything from movies to health care. At their core, these technologies rely on probabilistic models. But as these systems become more complex, it becomes more difficult to quickly and efficiently calculate the probabilities. Liu\u2019s research aims to address this dilemma by developing a new theoretical and algorithmic framework of efficient and approximate computation of probabilities for highly complex probabilistic models. Liu expects that his work will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, and also develop educational modules for outreach activities to high school students and undergraduates. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl uses machine learning to enable computers to make sense of the visual world. With help from the CAREER award, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl plans to develop efficient, robust, and compact video representations. This can reduce the massive economic and environmental costs of modern digital infrastructure. He also plans to develop computer systems that are better at recognizing what's going on in videos or in the world around them, which could result, for example, in surveillance and assistive technologies for the elderly that are more responsive, or autonomous robots that can move through the world and interact with humans more safely. According to Rossbach, data centers are projected to consume between 9 and 20 percent of the world's total power by 2025, \"so improved performance and efficiency are important to the health of our planet.\" Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are reconfigurable devices that could help achieve that goal. But traditional operating systems, designed for fixed-function devices, don't translate well to these new devices which change frequently. Rossbach's research is aimed at developing software for FPGAs that improves utilization and throughput by an order of magnitude or more. Liu, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, and Rossbach will join the ranks of distinguished researchers from UT and around the world. They received this honor alongside Carlos Baiz, assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry. This announcement was updated on Aug. 9, 2019 to include Christopher Rossbach.

Ethical Foundations of Computer Science is a one-hour course consisting of class discussion and student presentations that first launched this spring. Students in the class think about and discuss a wide range of issues, from privacy to harassment, and how technology influences the ethical decisions surrounding those issues. Norman had wanted to create a class like this for a while, and last year, when the undergraduate office offered funding for a course with an ethics and leadership flag, she and Abraham submitted a proposal for Ethical Foundations. \u201cI feel like our students are young for the most part, so they don\u2019t yet have the perspective on how much software is affecting the world,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI'm concerned that it's possible to make ethical decisions in implementing programs and not even realize that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Although Abraham\u2019s upper-division elective Contemporary Issues in Computer Science course also covers ethical issues, this class is unique because it offers these discussions to freshmen. This is by design: Norman said the class is supposed to set up a foundation for ethical thinking, hence the name, that could be built upon in later classes that the students take. \u201cThe goal is that we have this conversation in the first year, they get practice thinking about these issues, and then all of the faculty can in build off of it in their classes,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is set it up so that it\u2019s an ongoing conversation the whole time they\u2019re here.\u201d So that all computer science freshmen can start with this ethical foundation, Norman and Abraham have thought about making Ethical Foundations mandatory for a computer science degree. However, this raises some challenges; a required course would likely need to accommodate more students per class in order to offer the course to every student. Currently, the class only has about 60 students, and while it would be easy to scale up the course into a giant lecture class, it would be hard to maintain the active, thoughtful component currently required of students, Norman said. \u201cThe question is, how do you scale up something that is heavily group-based and intended to be very discussion-heavy,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re currently mulling over, what would need to be changed to make that work while still giving them a comprehensive education, rather than just talking at them for an hour.\u201d In contrast with Contemporary Issues, which goes more in-depth with technical issues like cyber warfare or fake news, Abraham said Ethical Foundations deals with more personal issues, such as cheating and treating others in a respectful and welcoming manner, before expanding to larger issues like privacy or hacking. \u201cIt\u2019s more targeted towards helping people adjust to college life, making sure they can behave respectfully towards each other and build towards ethical behavior, hence why it\u2019s \u2018ethical foundations,\u2019\u201d she said. One topic that the class has already covered, Abraham said, is the hidden biases in data and technology. For example, an ongoing series by investigative journalism organization ProPublica explores the machine bias found in Facebook\u2019s restriction of hate speech, computer algorithms that predict future crime and more. \u201cWe assume that computers will be unbiased, but it turns out that when you\u2019re looking at statistics and data, all of that is very influenced by a variety of things,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cBecoming unbiased is a lot more challenging than people might think. Just because it\u2019s a computer doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s entirely fair.\u201d A real-world example of these biases is smart watches that have had trouble measuring the pulse of people with dark or tattooed skin, according to Norman. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no diversity in tech, no one had stopped to think that it was going to marginalize large numbers of people,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about how it\u2019s not only unethical to make them feel like they don\u2019t belong as part of the society, but also, it\u2019s bad business.\u201d Abraham hopes students leave the class thinking about these issues as they find jobs and continue with their careers. \u201cI hope that they get an awareness of the decisions they\u2019re making and how their decisions affect others, and through the magic of technology, lots and lots of others,\u201d Norman said.",

    "text_content": "Concentrations Offer Expertise in Specialized Fields of Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Concentrations Offer Expertise in Specialized Fields of Computer Science Posted by Julianne Hodges on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 For students who are passionate about a specialized subfield of computer science, Texas Computer Science has made it easier for them to enhance their skills and set themselves apart by choosing a concentration. Concentrations , a structured sets of elective courses around specific topics, are now available in the areas of computer systems , cybersecurity , game development , machine learning and artificial intelligence , mobile computing , and big data. These concentration areas are all growing fields in research and industry. The specialized experience found in the courses included in the programs will give students the skills and knowledge necessary for internships and careers in these fields. Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area, and Associate Chair for Academics Bruce Porter said he expects to add more concentrations as the field continues to evolve and new technologies emerge. \u201cThe great thing about the concentrations here at the department level, we can create new ones or tear down old ones, we can just do it here with the wave of a wand,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIf a student group were to come and say, how about a new concentration area, I would be very open to seeing if we can make that work.\u201d In the past, UT computer science students took more required core classes and were able to take fewer elective classes, Porter said. But when the number of required classes was reduced about eight years ago, students were better able to pursue their interests by choosing more specialized upper-division electives. The idea behind the concentrations is the same. \u201cNow, students have the opportunity if they\u2019re really fascinated about, say, robotics, or they\u2019re really fascinated about computer systems, and that\u2019s where they\u2019re planning to make their mark and take a career, now they can choose their elective options in that area and get a certificate along the way,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI am expecting that industry is going to be really excited about these new pipelines for talent.\u201d To put together the concentration areas, Porter found a faculty leader enthusiastic about each area of study who could design the curriculum. Next, the challenge was to implement the curriculum and ensure that the classes would always be accessible enough for students to easily get into the courses they need. \u201cIt\u2019s not always straightforward, because sometimes the curriculum draws on courses from other departments, or they draw on courses that the department doesn't offer regularly,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIn order to put a course into the concentration, we had to find ways of making sure that the courses that are in the concentration would be offered regularly.\u201d Porter emphasized that students are still able to sample as many different areas of interest  as they want during their time at UT, but now there are more opportunities for students who have a passion for a particular field and want to learn more. The concentrations are designed to add no time to a degree plan, so students interested in any of the concentration areas are encouraged to talk to their advisor about fitting the course requirements into their degree plan.

    "text_content": "New Dual Degree Honors Program at The University of Texas at Austin Combines Computer Science, Business | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Dual Degree Honors Program at The University of Texas at Austin Combines Computer Science, Business Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 A new, highly selective integrated honors degree program in computer science and business at The University of Texas at Austin will offer a rigorous four-year undergraduate curriculum aimed at preparing students for top technology careers. The Texas Honors Computer Science and Business program combines two of UT\u2019s most highly regarded honors degrees in a format that takes less time to complete than the previous option of double-majoring in both. The university\u2019s undergraduate computer science and McCombs School\u2019s Texas BBA programs are ranked among the 10 best, both nationally and internationally. Last year, the Business Honors Program admitted 244 students out of 1,828 applications, while the Turing Scholars Honors Program in computer science admitted 127 students out of 1,192 applicants. The Texas CSB offers distinct benefits for students looking toward careers in today\u2019s tech-focused business world. University leaders anticipate that it will attract high-achieving students with strong quantitative and technical skills from across the nation. The program is a particularly attractive opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs and for students interested in data and marketing analytics, financial engineering, and leadership roles in tech companies. Computer science provides both the practical know-how and the deep technological understanding necessary for many fields. \u201cThose skills are highly complementary to the skills developed by our students in the Business Honors Program \u2014 leadership, business analytical ability, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurial spirit \u2014 and together provide the foundations for a successful and lasting career,\u201d says Professor Andres Almazan, BHP director at the McCombs School. \u201cIn our tech-driven economy, computer science is increasingly integrated into everything we do, including how we conduct business. Computer scientists are launching startups, making large-scale investment decisions, gleaning insights from big data, and managing our largest corporations,\u201d says Professor Don Fussell , chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201cThe Texas CSB program will ensure that our students have a deep understanding of the larger business context to enable them to fully leverage their technical skills.\u201d Texas CSB will offer enrolled students a like-minded community, placing them in a small cohort of up to 40 honors-level peers savvy in both business and technology. Challenging coursework will provide a solid understanding of both business and computer science, while simultaneously enabling students to earn degrees in CS and business more quickly than studying each discipline independently. Additionally, special programming on entrepreneurship and experiential learning will give students the chance to turn concepts into action. Specific internship and recruiting opportunities from top companies will offer positions that combine business with technology. \u201cThis type of program helps students become more marketable and really benefits the businesses they join and the businesses they start themselves,\u201d says Sean Scott, BA Computer Science '95 and MBA \u201905, vice president of robotics for Amazon. \u201cThe combined degree enables you to go beyond technical challenges and into the fundamentals of the business, blurring the boundaries of historical job titles and roles,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThe knowledge I gained from pairing my business degree with my CS degree gave me the business acumen to work across an entire company and opened up new areas and opportunities for me to explore.\u201d With the Texas CSB, The University of Texas at Austin joins prestigious peer institutions that have recently taken a similar approach in creating a streamlined way for high-performing students to complete challenging dual degree coursework in only four years. Texas CSB is seeking top high-school seniors preparing to apply for fall 2019 freshman admission\u2014leaders both academically and in their schools and communities\u2014who envision a career that combines business and computer science. The application process opens on Aug. 1, 2018 and runs through Dec. 1, 2018. For more information, visit the Texas CSB website .

    "text_content": "Professor Scott Niekum Teaches Robots to Help Humans with Dreaded Tasks | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor Scott Niekum Teaches Robots to Help Humans with Dreaded Tasks Posted by Julianne Hodges on Wednesday, July 18, 2018 Robots are everywhere, from the Roomba cleaning your floor to the first self-driving cars traveling the roads. As robots advance and help with more and more tedious or dangerous tasks, they need an easy and efficient way to learn and adapt to their surroundings. Computer science assistant professor and director of the Personal Autonomous Robotics Lab (PeARL) Scott Niekum looks for ways to simplify training these robotic helpers by showing them how to do their jobs through demonstration, bypassing much of the complicated coding and computer science expertise needed by robots today. The goal is to have robots increase productivity and take over \u201cthe 3 D\u2019s\u201d of tasks: jobs that are dirty, dangerous or dull. For homes, that includes cleaning the house and collecting waste, and for workplaces that can range from inspecting sewer pipes and assembling products to working in a hazardous nuclear reactor. \u201cIn homes, we\u2019d like to see robots do everything from taking over monotonous tasks to helping the disabled and elderly gain more autonomy and lead fuller lives,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cSome of the benefits of AI in these situations are that it doesn\u2019t get bored, it can\u2019t get injured \u2014 and if it gets broken, it can be replaced or fixed \u2014 and it is better at some types of tasks than humans are.\u201d Right now, robots with artificial intelligence are coded and trained to do specific tasks, a technique that requires a lot of work by robotics experts to \u201cteach\u201d the robots to do their jobs. That\u2019s a significant obstacle to widespread use, Niekum said, since robots that would be used in different homes and workplaces would need to do a wide variety of different tasks. That\u2019s where Niekum\u2019s research comes in: instead of having a robotics expert train a robot to do every single task, customized for every home or company, the people who use the robots would teach them by showing them what to do. \u201cTypically, a robotics expert such as me or one of my graduate students needs to spend weeks or months programming a robot to do a specific task in a specific environment,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cThat model will never scale to widespread deployment, so instead, we try to build learning robots that can simply be shown what to do so that they are customizable by the user.\u201d However, there are also challenges to teaching this robots this way, Niekum said. In order to show a robot what to do, it must be able to watch a human\u2019s body movements and translate that movement into something that it can accomplish with its own body, even if it has a completely different body structure from a human. In addition, the robot must be able to understand ambiguous movements and cues from humans. \u201cHumans are very good at judging the intentions and goals of other humans because we have an enormous amount of prior life experiences to draw upon,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cRobots don\u2019t have access to this level of data yet, making it challenging to properly interpret human behaviors.\u201d Currently, researchers in PeARL are working on a project that uses YouTube videos to help robots learn how to cook. By finding context from additional sources of information on the internet, such as videos and recipes written in natural language instead of code, the robot can better understand any ambiguous signals from a human demonstrator. PeARL is also investigating how to make robots better understand human intentions through interpreting eye gaze and natural language instructions. \u201cGaze and natural language provide very rich information about a person\u2019s goals, beliefs, and intentions,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cHowever, gaze is difficult to accurately track from video alone, and natural language is notoriously difficult to interpret correctly. Thus, we are researching ways make use of this data, even when our interpretation of it has significant uncertainty.\u201d In order to allow for their widespread use, however, another important part of Niekum\u2019s research is making sure that these robots are safe and reliable. PeARL researchers are also investigating how to provide guarantees about the safety of a system despite learning new tasks. \u201cThis is challenging, but can be done in a mathematically principled way, not so different in spirit from the tools engineers have developed over the years to make sure that bridges or buildings are safe,\u201d Niekum said. In addition to being safe, robots need to be able to detect errors through data sources like sound and vision, then correct those errors. For example , the robot needs to know what success and failure looks like, and it needs to be able to select the right viewpoints to see what went wrong. \u201cWith a bit of human supervision, robots can learn the perceptual signals that accompany success and failure in a task \u2014 for example, the sight of a screw going in or missing a hole, or the click or absence of a click for a door closing properly,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cIf the robot can detect these failures reliably and early, they can often be addressed by trying again or issuing a recovery behavior. Other times \u2014 for example, if a glass is broken \u2014 they must halt the task and/or alert a human.\u201d Right now, these research questions are barriers to making robots more commonplace in homes and workplaces, but Niekum and the PeARL researchers are working on these problems and helping make robots safe, reliable and easily customizable by average users. \u201cI believe that learning from demonstration is the only feasible way for end-users to program robots to perform the multitude of tasks that they desire,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cAs mobile robots with manipulation capabilities become lower-cost over time, I suspect that we will see robots in homes and workplaces on a large scale that can be taught via demonstration, as well as learn from other modalities, including natural language conversations.\u201d News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Research Tags Artificial Intelligence Personal Autonomous Robotics Lab natural language processing",

The course is self-paced with a suggested calendar but everything is due by the close of the course on May 31. Robert and Maggie have enhanced the course by working with MathWorks to enable participants to use Matlab freely throughout the course. The Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers which offers a verified certificate of completion for a small fee or is free audits, was launched by edX, UT\u2019s non-profit partner which manages MOOCs in January of 2015. By linking the theory of linear algebra to issues that arise when implementing high-performance software libraries, the course content connects the mathematics to issues encountered in computer architecture, software engineering, and program correctness. The course builds on ongoing research by the instructors on how to develop and implement high-performance linear algebra libraries, funded by the National Science Foundation, so that the participant is simultaneously exposed to introductory material and the cutting edge of the field.

    "text_content": "UT Computer Science Adding Ethics Courses to Curriculum | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Computer Science Adding Ethics Courses to Curriculum Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 AUSTIN ( KXAN ) \u2014 At the University of Texas at Austin, computer science students are being asked to go beyond coding and engineering. Their department wants them to graduate with an understanding of ethics as well. This semester at UT there\u2019s a new computer science course called \u201cEthical Foundations of Computer Science\u201d which introduces first-year students to ethical dilemmas they may be familiar with (cheating, sexual harassment) and over time helps them to draw parallels to problems they may encounter working in technology. Sarah Abraham and Alison Norman , the two lecturers teaching this course, say there are around 60 students enrolled currently. They hope to eventually make the course a requirement for the more than 400 students who enter their department each year. Abraham teaches another ethics course for upperclassmen which has been around a while longer, but that class was more popular than the department had room for. \u201cAs we look at technology and it becomes pervasive in our lives, we have to understand the effects of the technology we have and to think critically about what we\u2019re doing so we can do it properly,\u201d said Norman. She knows her students will go on to work with technology that will impact things like medical devices, phones, maybe even driverless cars. \u201cWithout this sort of training, our students are less likely to realize the impacts of their software,\u201d she said. Her department is often ranked as one of the top in the country. UT specifies that it\u2019s the largest computer science department by enrollment among the top 10 ranked in US News. UT Austin is one of several highly-ranked departments to turn their focus towards teaching ethics. According to a New York Times report, this semester Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are offering a joint course on artificial intelligence ethics, last fall Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned about ethical challenges, New York University has a new data science ethics course, and Stanford professors are developing a computer science ethics course which students can enroll in next year. \u201cI think it\u2019s been one of the most important classes I\u2019ve taken,\u201d said UT Computer Science vajor Mridhul Maddela, who is taking the upperclassmen ethics course. \u201cWe\u2019re learning how to use this software, and [they\u2019re] teaching something that everybody should know in terms of how to combat security threats or security issues and what coding will make the best sense from an ethical perspective.\u201d After he graduates, Maddela already has a job lined up with Exxon Mobil working with their business intelligence platform. He plans to bring the ideas he learned about in computer science ethics courses to his new job. \u201cI think a lot of the ethical issues that we see are people acting inappropriately, towards all this data, whether they\u2019re stealing identities or misusing information and spinning it in a wrong way,\u201d Maddela said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to have classes like these and to learn about, you know, in the age of information, what are the right things to do?\u201d Students like Maddela are learning about everything from propaganda to whistle-blowers, to worms, to cyber warfare. \u201cIf I have soldiers holding a gun to your head, that\u2019s a threat right? What if I put a virus on your system? Is that a threat? Have I invaded your country?\u201d Abraham asked her students Monday. (The answer, she says, is yes.) She hopes her students in this hyper-technical field don\u2019t forget about the importance of soft skills that will help them assess right from wrong. \u201cThe medical industry has a lot of ethics, legal and business\u2013these are all industries that [focus on] it,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like ethics came out of nowhere, I think computer science, maybe as a field that\u2019s fairly new in some ways, is just realizing the importance of that.\u201d This program will likely have implications for the future at UT\u2019s growing Computer Science department. As of early 2018, the department had 1,750 undergraduate students and 250 graduate students, with eyes set on boosting enrollment to 1,900 undergraduate students. In recent years, the department reached capacity and has had to control enrollment. Computer science is now one of the largest majors at UT. Graduates in computer science at UT are often recruited to big-name companies. The top ten companies which hire UT CS graduates include Faceboook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon. Barbary Brunner, CEO of the Austin Technology Council, believes that what these ethics courses at UT are \u201ca really valuable thing.\u201d She explained that as companies in the tech world search for new ways to disrupt old ideas, it\u2019s important to look at the human implications of what they\u2019re setting out to do. \u201cThis may be where the university leads the industry and the industry wakes up and says, \u2018Wow that\u2019s really smart,'\u201d Brunner said. \u201cFor Texas to become a real tech powerhouse\u2013 which I think it can become \u2014 it needs to engage in the same sort of collaboration between higher education and the technology community that you see in California, that you see in the Seattle area.\u201d Brunner hasn\u2019t heard many overarching discussions of ethics within the Austin tech world, but knows that individual discussions about ethics are going on at many companies, especially those related to security and artificial intelligence. In the long run she thinks that ethics training may become one of many qualities tech companies look for in the recent graduates they hire.

Turing Scholars consists of about 200 UTCS students and accepts about 50 freshmen per year, creating a tight-knit community focused on research and academic challenges. The program culminates in an honors thesis during the students' senior year. \u201cOur goals from the beginning have been to create the very best CS undergraduate program in the country,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done a great job towards that goal, but if we look to the future, we want to keep adding to the program.\u201d Currently the Turing Scholars program lacks funding for staff support, recruitment efforts, and student activities, but the Calvin Lin Turing Scholars Endowment will provide the money needed to sustain these efforts. The Turing Scholars program is its own community within UTCS and combines the small class size and the opportunity for faculty interaction of a small college with the advantages of a large research university. Throughout their time at UTCS, the students take 10 of their core classes together. \u201cWe all know each other on a first-name basis,\u201d said UTCS student and Turing Scholar Ariel Szekely. \u201cA large portion of my friend group all come from Turing, and we really grow together through all of these classes that we take together and all of the different projects that we work on together. It has given me a place where I feel like I really belong.\u201d Last year, the Calvin Lin Turing Scholars Endowment was created in order to give financial support to the Turing Scholars program and help take the program to the next level. In November and December, over $188,000 was raised through HornRaiser , 753 percent of the campaign\u2019s original $25,000 goal. The endowment was used to improve upper-division classes for Turing scholars and fund recruitment of new students into the program. This winter, the Turing Scholars program is again raising money for the endowment with a goal of $25,000. Contributions will be accepted through January 12 through HornRaiser . The endowment will help improve classes for upperclassmen and aid in the recruitment of high school students. \u201cI would hope that the alums would look back fondly at their time here and realize that it was a great experience, and I would hope they would want to help us provide the same types of experiences, and maybe better experiences, for future generations of students,\u201d Lin said.",

In each state, the colors show the growth factors of the top (left) and bottom (right) layer, and the thin black lines indicate the direction of growth. The top layer is viewed from the front, and the bottom layer is viewed from the back, to highlight the complexity of the geometries. (Credit Harvard SEAS) UT College of Natural Sciences News | October 16, 2017 Nature has a way of making complex shapes from a set of simple growth rules. The curve of a petal, the swoop of a branch, even the contours of our face are shaped by these processes. What if we could unlock those rules and reverse engineer nature's ability to grow an infinitely diverse array of shapes? Scientists from Harvard University and the University of Texas at Austin have done just that. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers demonstrate a technique to grow any target shape from any starting shape. This work might have applications in soft robotics, artificial lenses or in tissue engineering. Watch a video of a snapdragon forming from a cylinder Watch a video of scientist Max Planck's face forming from a flat disc \"Architect Louis Sullivan once said that 'form ever follows function',\" said L. Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics, of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and of Physics at Harvard University and senior author of the study. \"But if one took the opposite perspective, that perhaps function should follow form, how can we inverse design form?\" In previous research, the Mahadevan group used experiments and theory to explain how naturally morphing structures \u2014 such as Venus flytraps, pine cones and flowers \u2014 changed their shape in the hopes of one day being able to control and mimic these natural processes. And indeed, experimentalists have begun to harness the power of simple, bioinspired growth patterns. For example, in 2016, in a collaboration with the group of Jennifer Lewis, the Hansjorg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Core Faculty Member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the team printed a range of structures that changed its shape over time in response to environmental stimuli. \"The challenge was how to do the inverse problem,\" said Wim van Rees, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the paper.\"There's a lot of research on the experimental side but there's not enough on the theoretical side to explain what's actually happening. The question is, if I want to end with a specific shape, how do I design my initial structure?\" Inspired by the growth of leaves, the researchers developed a theory for how to pattern the growth orientations and magnitudes of a bilayer, two different layers of elastic materials glued together that respond differently to the same stimuli. By programming one layer to swell more and/or in a different direction than the other, the overall shape and curvature of the bilayer can be fully controlled. In principle, the bilayer can be made of any material, in any shape, and respond to any stimuli from heat to light, swelling, or even biological growth. The team unraveled the mathematical connection between the behavior of the bilayer and that of a single layer. \"We found a very elegant relationship in a material that consists of these two layers,\" said van Rees. \"You can take the growth of a bilayer and write its energy directly in terms of a curved monolayer.\" That means that if you know the curvatures of any shape you can reverse engineer the energy and growth patterns needed to grow that shape using a bilayer. \"This kind of reverse engineering problem is notoriously difficult to solve, even using days of computation on a supercomputer,\" said Etienne Vouga, former postdoctoral fellow in the group, now an assistant professor of Computer Science at UT Austin. \"By elucidating how the physics and geometry of bilayers are intimately coupled, we were able to construct an algorithm that solves for the needed growth pattern in seconds, even on a laptop, no matter how complicated the target shape.\" The researchers demonstrated the system by modeling the growth of a snapdragon flower petal from a cylinder, a topographical map of the Colorado river basin from a flat sheet and, most strikingly, the face of Max Planck, one of the founders of quantum physics, from a disk. \"Overall, our research combines our knowledge of the geometry and physics of slender shells with new mathematical algorithms and computations to create design rules for engineering shape,\" said Mahadevan. \"It paves the way for manufacturing advances in 4-D printing of shape-shifting optical and mechanical elements, soft robotics as well as tissue engineering.\" The researchers are already collaborating with experimentalists to try out some of these ideas. This research was funded in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the US National Science Foundation. This piece was based on a press release by Leah Burrows at Harvard University.

Nadella spoke to students at the University of Texas at Austin inside the Hogg Memorial Auditorium Monday. He is currently promoting his new book, \u201cHit Refresh \u2014 The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft\u2019s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone.\u201d He told students Microsoft constantly works to portray an image of wanting to soak up information, rather than being a \u201cknow-it-all.\u201d \u201cStartups are a massive inspiration for us,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst we have our own venture firm, which helps us have a great sensor network. We know what startups care about. We invest in them. We foster their growth. That\u2019s fantastic. The other thing is we buy a lot of companies.

    "text_content": "Faculty and Students from Across Campus Collaborate in Robotics Consortium | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Faculty and Students from Across Campus Collaborate in Robotics Consortium Posted by Julianne Hodges on Thursday, December 7, 2017 UT recently launched the Robotics Consortium , a group that brings together researchers from industry and across campus to collaborate on robotics research. Peter Stone , UTCS professor and the director of the Robotics Consortium, said robotics researchers campus-wide saw an opportunity to create an organized structure that partnered with leading companies in the robotics industry in order to enhance robotics research and better serve industry needs. Additionally, the core robotics faculty want to enhance the graduate student experience by exposing them to research of other groups on campus and have direct interaction with industry representatives. Bringing together both hardware and software, robotics research spans multiple departments on the Forty Acres and includes faculty from computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical & computer engineering and aerospace engineering. For example, mechanical engineering includes building motors and gears, while computer science and electrical engineering deals with machine learning algorithms and human-robot interactions, Stone said. In the past, the different robotics labs have held seminars to showcase their collaborative work. This semester, the robotics faculty have also hosted open houses and lab tours every other week. These events let researchers show off their work and bring together the grad students to discuss their research. UT recently launched a robotics graduate portfolio program as part of the robotics consortium. \u201cThe portfolio program is one way \u2026  to communicate that we\u2019re really serious about robotics here, enough so that we can provide a certification for our graduate students that they specialize in robotics,\u201d said Scott Niekum , UTCS professor and core robotics faculty member of the consortium. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good way to signal expertise to industry as well.\u201d Additionally, the graduate portfolio program provides a platform for companies to easily recruit robotics-focused students. Robotics has been increasingly used for many purposes, such as manufacturing jobs where humans are less efficient than robots, according to aerospace engineering professor and core robotics faculty Ufuk Topcu . \u201cThe reach of autonomy and robotics into industry is endless, and industry pays attention to the things we do,\u201d Topcu said. \u201cThey want to see what is out there at the forefront of robotics so they can know what to adopt.\u201d As part of the robotics consortium, companies who partner with the program can recruit students working on robotics, give talks at the university and send a researcher to work on campus with UT faculty. The founding consortium partners are Sandia National Laboratories , a nuclear science research institution; Arm , an international semiconductor and software design company; Omnicell , a healthcare software company; and Orbotech , an international company that manufactures electronics. Robots are used in a variety of industry applications, from working in hazardous environments such as in the nuclear industry to service robots that assist in the home. Industry and academia often approach research, such as that in the field of robotics, in different ways. For example, companies often work on short-term problems, while academic researchers focus on long-term goals. \u201cA lot of industry is recognizing that there\u2019s potential value in having robust and highly-capable robots and robotics, but they don\u2019t know how to do it all themselves,\u201d Stone said. \u201cSome of it they can do and some of it they need to be thinking ahead and they need long-term research to help guide the way. We also, from the research community, need guidance from industry as to what are the current unsolved problems and what are the interesting directions to go in the future.\u201d For example, some car companies such as Toyota and Tesla are actively researching and developing autonomous vehicles. While these companies are working on improving the functionality of these cars, academic researchers can start thinking about the safety of these vehicles, how much we can trust them to drive on the streets, and what kinds of regulations they may be subject to, Topcu explained. \u201cIn this sense, within the same problem domain, industry and academia can serve to complementing challenges, and once both of them make progress we will have a collective solution,\u201d he said. The Robotics Consortium officially launched in the fall semester of 2017 and consists of the core robotics faculty, who include Peter Stone, Ashish Desphande,  Scott Niekum, Mitch Pryor, Luis Sentis, James Sulzer, Andrea Thomaz and Ufuk Topcu.

On Wed, 24 May 2017, the UT Competitive Programming team competed at the ACM-ICPC World Finals , the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world, at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology in Rapid City, South Dakota. The competition consisted of teams from 133 regions across the world (approx. 532 students) trying to solve 12 programming problems of varying levels of difficulty in 5 hrs and 20 min. The first-place team, St. Petersburg University, solved 10 problems. UT solved 4 problems and tied with 53 other teams for 56th place. In total, a record 50,145 students competed in regional competitions worldwide, and of the 532 students who made it to the world finals, the UT team of three students finished in the top half. Teams consist of three students. The students on the UT team were Alex Meed, Brian Richer, and Supawit Chockchowwat; the faculty coaches were Etienne Vouga, Glenn Downing, and Shyamal Mitra. UT qualified for the world finals this year by winning the South Central USA region , which includes Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana and includes over 60 teams from 25+ schools. UT has been competing in the Regionals since 1997, and places in the top 5 almost every year. In 2014, one of our four teams took 2nd place at the regionals. In 2015, one of our four teams took 2nd place again, but all four of our teams were in the top seven. In 2016, our four teams swept the regionals with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place. Qualification for the world finals this year followed a concerted effort to improve UT's performance at the contests, including the creation of a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming , taught by the faculty coaches and club officers. The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premiere global programming competition conducted by and for the world\u2019s universities. The competition operates under the auspices of ACM, is sponsored by IBM, and is headquartered at Baylor University. For nearly four decades, the ICPC has grown to be a game-changing global competitive educational program that has raised aspirations and performance of generations of the world\u2019s problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering. The ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at Texas A&M in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The idea quickly gained popularity within the United States and Canada as an innovative initiative to raise the aspirations, performance, and opportunity of the top students in the emerging field of computer science. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first Finals held at the ACM Computer Science Conference in 1977. Operating under the auspices of ACM and headquartered at Baylor University since 1989, the contest has expanded into a global network of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Since IBM became a sponsor in 1997, ICPC participation has increased by more than 2000%. This year ICPC Regional participation included 46,381 of the finest students and faculty in computing disciplines from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents. A record 50,145 students and 5,073 coaches competed in ICPC and ICPC-assisted competitions this year, setting new records in participation.

The instructors say one or two each year go on to become real businesses. \"The real world is pretty friendly to entrepreneurship right now, and Austin is a great place to be,\" said co-instructor Mellie Price . The 13 companies that participated in \"Demo Day\" ranged from a mobile app that helps you find a long distance ride to a drone company to a protein donut shop. Price explained, \"Roughly 25 percent of Austin's economic impact is through small businesses.\" She said, \"This is about building the foundation, helping them get it launched, and the real world will support them in expanding and growing their businesses.\" Recently, a study by RewardExpert looked at the best and worst places to start a small business , and the Austin-Round Rock area came in at #10. The study found Austin's startup growth rate is in the 89th percentile, and the five-year survival rate for startups is high. But the study also pointed out a drawback: high office space rental prices. Another co-instructor of Longhorn Startup, Joshua Baer said, \"While Austin's recognized as being a cost effective city overall, everybody realizes it is more expensive today than it was a year ago.\" Baer said it's a growing pain for a growing city. \"That's one reason why companies have to go raise funding or get customers because it costs money to make money,\" he said. But even with the challenges that come with rental prices, he said, \"Overall, I think Austin has the #1 most important strength which is talent. We have all the people moving here. People want to live here. That's why we're the fastest growing city in the country, that's why we have so much great talent moving here.\" Austin is expected to add about 3 million square feet of commercial office space this year. But supply still can't keep up with demand. The \"average\" office rent rose more than 9 percent last year to more than $37 a square foot per year. It's even higher the closer you get to center of the city. Office space in downtown Austin is averaging closer to $50 square foot per year. For now, student entrepreneurs say they're sticking to their passion while thinking of ways to keep their operating costs low. \"Startup is just my passion,\" said freshman Arooj Sheikh. \"If you have a goal, if you have a dream that you care about, you'll figure it out. Whether you're working out of coffee shops, you're working out of your living room, it doesn't matter.\" \"We don't really need a huge office space until we get really big. We can manage out of our apartments,\" said freshman Kush Singh who helped to find a long distance travel app called Krew. Krew took home the $25,000 investment prize.

    "text_content": "Austin Hosts 20th Annual MODELS Conference | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Austin Hosts 20th Annual MODELS Conference Posted by Julianne Hodges on Monday, October 9, 2017 Last month, researchers came together in Austin to discuss model-based software and systems engineering at this year\u2019s 20th annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Models Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, or MODELS . The conference consisted of a main conference on Sept. 20-22, where papers accepted for the conference were presented, and a satellite conference made up of several workshops and tutorials on Sept. 17-19. Keynote speakers included Jeannie Falcon, chief engineer for control and simulation at National Instruments; Ira Baxter, CEO and CTO of computer consulting company Semantic Designs; and Adam Porter, professor of computer science at the University of Maryland and executive director of the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering . Falcon covered efforts to overcome challenges in modeling and simulation such as cutting down on time needed to develop and calibrate models, Baxter spoke about how to treat models and code consistently when converting between the two, and Porter discussed the Fraunhofer organization and how they use models in their everyday work. UTCS professor Don Batory served as the general chair for the conference. According to Jeho Oh, UTCS PhD student and student volunteer co-chair of the conference, models are conceptual representations of problems that try to capture the structure and logic of an analyzed system. \u201cThey foster common understanding and allow verifications which can become very complicated without it,\u201d Oh said. \u201cThis is especially critical for complex, safety-critical systems, to make sure that the system works regarding the domain knowledge while avoiding flaws in the design which may incur system failures.\u201d National Instruments group manager Taylor Rich\u00e9 said models use frameworks that represent the software at a higher level than the code itself. \u201cBy ensuring these higher-level constructs are correct, we can then use repeatable transformations of these models to create software that is hopefully cheaper to build and less buggy,\u201d Rich\u00e9 said. For example, LabVIEW , a software product from National Instruments, helps scientists and engineers model their work. \u201cMany other companies use modeling to ensure that their software is more correct than traditional programming methodologies, and the MODELS conference continues to try to increase industrial involvement and interest,\u201d said Rich\u00e9, who is the project facilitator for LabVIEW NXG. Oh, who works with Batory on efficiently finding optimal configurations for configurable software systems, said the keynote presentations and panel sessions were interesting because they showed the different perspectives between industry and academia. \u201cMany methods proposed in academia have not yet been used in the industry, and it seems to take a long time and effort to make something in paper be actually usable,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe meeting people with similar interests is one big merit of attending conferences, besides the technical presentations.\u201d The conference is held in different cities around the world every year, and Rich\u00e9, who was the local arrangements chair of the conference, said the conference has a different feel each year based on the location. This year the conference had a \u201cTexas feel.\u201d \u201cIt was great to have barbeque at the banquet, maybe something only possible in Texas!\u201d Oh said.",

    "text_content": "The Implications of Quantum Computing: Internet Security, Random Bits, and More | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Implications of Quantum Computing: Internet Security, Random Bits, and More Posted by Tracy Zhang on Friday, January 25, 2019 Quantum computers are sophisticated machines that harness the strange laws of quantum physics to solve particular kinds of problems. These machines have been \u201ctrending\u201d for quite some time now with popular media calling them \u201csupercomputers\u201d or \u201csupermachines\u201d and implying that they have the power to basically answer any and all currently unsolvable problems. These is, however, a misconception. In reality, practically useful quantum computers do not exist yet. Big technology companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft have been trying to build commercial quantum computing machines for years now. According to Scott Aaronson , a Texas Computer Science professor and quantum computing researcher, there are three main possibilities for the future of quantum computing. One, we can build quantum computers and they can do things that traditional or classical computers can\u2019t do\u2014what Aaronson calls the \u201cboring or conservative\u201d possibility. Two, quantum computers can\u2019t be built and exist in theory only which tells us that there is something wrong with our current understanding of quantum physics and there needs to be a revolution in that field\u2014the \u201cmost exciting\u201d possibility. Or three, we can build quantum computers but everything a quantum computer can do can also be done by a classical computer\u2014we just haven\u2019t figured out how yet. Despite all this uncertainty, the potential that quantum computers may have is still very real and something to look forward to says Aaronson. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes this field so fascinating to work in!\u201d While there are possible advantages of quantum computers\u2014like using them to simulate physics and chemistry, and then conceivably using these simulations to aid in the design of new drugs, materials, and chemical reactions\u2014there are potential dangers as well. For example, it is common knowledge in the field of quantum computing that quantum computers, once built, will dissolve all modern methods currently used to keep the internet secure. When internet security is compromised, users are exposed to a multitude of online dangers like fraud, property damage, and theft\u2014to name a few. Right now, users are safe because most web pages are protected against such dangers by encryption systems. These systems rely on using difficult mathematical problems\u2014take, for example, finding all factors of a large number\u2014to create a system that is believed to be unbreakable by classical computers. However, it has been proven that quantum computers can can solve these specific problems very quickly. In other words, \u201cIf someone were to build a quantum computer, they can basically break all that security\u201d says Aaronson. To combat this possible forthcoming problem, researchers now are working on cryptographic systems that are invulnerable to quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology hosts a competition to encourage the development of post-quantum computing cryptography. Despite these efforts, the process of creating and migrating to new encryption standards is a slow and difficult process and, according to Aaronson, one that might even take decades. This is why researchers are starting now even before they know if quantum computers can truly be built. Meanwhile, this past year, Aaronson has been researching how to potentially use a small-scale quantum computer to generate truly random bits, in other words, bits that can be proven to be random to a skeptical outsider. Random bits are integral in the security of cryptographic areas like cryptocurrency. Currently, they can be obtained from services over the internet. However, if these bits are not truly random, then the whole cryptographic system is vulnerable and can be exploited. Aaronson\u2019s scheme will use a classical computer with a seed (a small number of random bits) to generate challenges that are then sent to a quantum computer. If the quantum computer is able to answer those challenges within a short amount of time, then the client has a mathematical guarantee that the quantum computer's responses must contain a large amount of randomness under a cryptographic assumption. Aaronson's mathematical guarantee for generating random bits is one of a few applications that would work on small-scale quantum computers and may become available within the next few years. While the uncertainty of quantum computing is often overlooked and its implications oversimplified, researchers are still optimistic. From the hopes of creating new physics and chemistry simulations to possibly revolutionizing encryption systems and generating random bits\u2014if quantum computers can really be built and prove to be more useful than classical computers, then perhaps these machines really do have the potential to solve some of humanity\u2019s most complex problems.

In a project published on November 8, the New York Times explored the potential effect of autonomous cars on many aspects of the driving experience, from wildlife to traffic tickets and even city aesthetic and the need for street signs and how cities without drivers would look. As part of the project, one writer talked to UTCS professor and autonomous robotics researcher Peter Stone about how self-driving cars could speed up city commutes and make transportation safer. Stone said that autonomous cars would be safer and would only crash due to mechanical errors. Autonomous cars could also reduce traffic throughout a city since computers at intersections could figure out the most efficient route for each car, thereby requiring that less cars come to a stop and reducing the delay time at these intersections. \u201cRight now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,\u201d Stone said.

Normally, cryptographic implementations are either fast, but difficult to verify for correctness, or slow and easily verified. However, Vale is a flexible framework that allows for a high-performance assembly code that can be proven to be functionally correct. News Categories Awards & Honors Graduate Students",

The Academy, one of the first organizations of its kind in the country, was established in 1995 to honor and reward excellence in teaching by recognizing tenured faculty members who have continuously provided significant contributions to education throughout their career, especially at the undergraduate level. New members of the Academy are selected in a rigorous evaluation process. Faculty members are nominated by the dean of their college or school and then reviewed by a committee composed of current Academy members, other faculty members, students and university administrators. The provost then uses the committee's recommendations to make the final selections. Comprising approximately five percent of the tenured faculty in the university, the Academy provides leadership in improving the quality and depth of the undergraduate experience. Members advise the president and provost on matters related to the university's instructional mission; participate in seminars, colloquia, and workshops on teaching effectiveness; and serve as mentors to new faculty. Honorees are awarded the title Distinguished Teaching Professor, and serve for the duration of their tenure at UT Austin. Each member receives a permanent $7,000 annual academic salary increase, which takes effect the following academic year. Five other faculty members at UT Austin were also chosen for induction: James Cox from the College of Liberal Arts, Tracy Dahlby from the Moody College of Communication, Janet Davis from the College of Liberal Arts, Marianne Gedigian from the College of Fine Arts and Kumar Muthuraman from McCombs School of Business.

Yet she only started studying computer science by pure happenstance. Roesner initially applied only to The University of Texas\u2019 Plan II Honors Program. After realizing that the application required that she choose a backup major, Roesner selected computer science \u201cwithout really knowing what it was.\u201d Upon learning that she was accepted into both majors, she went to the advising office intending to drop computer science. However, her advisor recommended that Roesner take some courses in the major before making a decision. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful that they did that,\u201d Roesner commented. Roesner cites the course she took with TXCS professor Mike Scott as foundational for her burgeoning love for programming. As she went along in her computer science classes, she noted that \u201cI just enjoyed doing it\u2014the problem solving of programming, making a computer do something and having it work. It clicked with me, that way of thinking.\u201d Roesner has observed that \u201cso many people, especially from underrepresented groups in CS\u201d have a similar story: they didn\u2019t have much exposure to computer science growing up, but once they discovered the discipline, they fell in love with it. This initial foray encouraged her to continue studying computer science, which is a choice that has impacted the course of her career. Though now a seasoned researcher in the field of computer security and privacy, Roesner\u2019s first research experience started in her second year at UT Austin, when she became a Turing Scholar . In conjunction with her normal coursework, she delved into researching computer architecture. While she felt that this work was \u201ca great opportunity,\u201d it was during this time that Roesner took a security course and she began to learn where her intellectual passions lie. Roesner said that she loved learning how to adopt a \u201csecurity mindset\u201d that included \u201cchallenging assumptions and thinking about how we might misuse things rather than just building things.\u201d Security, to Roesner, is \u201cmore of a worldview rather than a specific slice of CS.\u201d The field is broad and impacts almost everybody in the world, and these attributes inspired her to research security when she entered graduate school at the University of Washington. Now, over ten years later, she continues to study various aspects of security and privacy, and her contributions have earned her numerous awards such as the MIT Technology Review\u2019s Innovators Under 35 . Roesner earned her PhD from the University of Washington, and soon after accepted a position at the school as an assistant professor. She considered taking an industry role, but realized that she enjoyed working with students. \u201cThere\u2019s industry research, but something you\u2019re missing is the student body and the energy...the faculty route has this nice combination of research and teaching.\u201d Currently, she works as an associate professor of computer science and engineering and co-directs the university\u2019s Security and Privacy Research Lab . Roesner describes her research interests as covering \u201cthe whole spectrum of things: from how we should design systems to be more secure, to how people interact with computing systems and what their security expectations are...and everything in between.\u201d The same \u201csecurity mindset\u201d that Roesner embraced during her undergraduate education still fuels her work today. She enjoys studying both how people use technology and the unexpected ways that technologies can be misused, with the ultimate goal of figuring out how to fix potential problems and make them safer. When deciding on which research projects to tackle, Roesner looks at which trends are currently relevant and what sectors \u201cneed to be looked at from a research perspective.\u201d For an example, just look at her work on augmented reality (AR) and security. While researching security and privacy issues on AR platforms, Roesner said that the \u201ccore question\u201d for her team was \u201cwhat was new about these platforms?\u201d With burgeoning technologies such as AR, the answers do not exist. As technological innovations continue to grow and accelerate at unprecedented speeds, it\u2019s crucial for researchers to examine the security and privacy implications so they can design more secure platforms. In the case of AR and security, Roesner\u2019s team worked toward creating solutions to these new problems. Roesner summed up her research ethos as such: \u201cYou have to understand what the right problems are and the constraints that people are working under. We want to push technical innovations, but we also want to make sure we\u2019re working on things that solve real problems. Sometimes the real problems come from those constraints.\u201d Roesner\u2019s recent research publications include \u201c Smart Devices in Airbnbs: Considering Privacy and Security for both Guests and Hosts \u201d and \u201c Bad News: Clickbait and Deceptive Ads on News and Misinformation Websites .\u201d More information about her work can be found on her website.",

On Sat, 4 Nov 2017, the UT Competitive Programming team won the ACM-ICPC South Central USA Regional Competition at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. The winning team, consisting of Arnav Sastry (senior), Daniel Talamas (senior), and Ethan Arnold (junior), will compete in the ACM-ICPC World Finals this coming April in Bejing , China. The competition consisted of 70+ teams from 25+ schools (approx. 225 students) from across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. UT Austin's top team solved ten problems, more than any other team. Due to technical problems with the automated contest judge, the final rankings of the other teams are still uncertain; provisionally UT Dallas came in 2nd and solved nine problems, and Texas A&M came in 3rd and solved eight problems. UT Austin's other three teams came in 5th ( Aditya Durvasula , Ho-Jae Jung, Jie Hao Liao), 8th (Alex Meed, Celik Savk , Supawit Chockchowwat ), and 17th (Alex Hong, Hoang Dinh , Miguel Obregon ). UT has been competing in the Regionals since 1997. In 2014, one of the four teams took 2nd place. In 2015, one of the four teams took 2nd place again. In 2016, the four teams swept the regionals with 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and 4th place. The UT team has seen marked improvement since the creation of a new elective, CS104c : Competitive Programming , taught by the faculty coaches Etienne Vouga and Glenn Downing and the student officers of the UT Competitive Programming Club. The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest ( ICPC ) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world\u2019s universities. The competition operates under the auspices of ACM, is sponsored by IBM, and is headquartered at Baylor University. For nearly four decades, the ICPC has grown to be a game-changing global competitive educational program that has raised aspirations and performance of generations of the world\u2019s problem solvers in the computing sciences and engineering. The ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at Texas A&M in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The idea quickly gained popularity within the United States and Canada as an innovative initiative to raise the aspirations, performance, and opportunity of the top students in the emerging field of computer science. The contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first Finals held at the ACM Computer Science Conference in 1977. Operating under the auspices of ACM and headquartered at Baylor University since 1989, the contest has expanded into a global network of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Since IBM became a sponsor in 1997, ICPC participation has increased by more than 2000%. This year ICPC Regional participation included 46,381 of the finest students and faculty in computing disciplines from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents. A record 50,145 students and 5,073 coaches competed in ICPC and ICPC-assisted competitions this year, setting new records in participation. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

    "text_content": "New Faculty Profile: Simon Peter | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Faculty Profile: Simon Peter Posted by Julianne Hodges on Tuesday, May 30, 2017 As an undergrad at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg in Germany, UTCS professor Simon Peter had two main hobbies: music and computer operating systems. While majoring in computer science, he also completed a minor in music. For a while, he was even interested in working on music synthesizers; his dream project is an operating system for synthesizers. \u201cI eventually decided to go the operating systems route for my Ph.D., but it\u2019s a possibility I could have been a synthesizer engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic can be very rigorous and mathematical in the way that it\u2019s expressed. From the practical side, there is a lot of engineering to music, [such as] sound engineering.\u201d Peter works on the efficiency and reliability of data centers at all levels of problems, from routing around failures in data centers to the energy efficiency of servers. His current research, which he had just started a couple of years before coming to UT last fall, focuses on helping servers improve efficiency so that they can deal with large amounts of data going in and out of servers. This is called called IO, or input/output, efficiency. Peter explained that computers were originally designed with the assumption that processing capacity is fast enough, but IO paths in and out of the servers didn\u2019t need to be as fast. However, as the use of data centers becomes increasingly popular, more and more people are accessing and entering more and more data in a server, leading to more requests to these servers. \u201cThe data centers themselves have become this driver of the economy, so everybody in society in one way or another is using data centers these days,\u201d Peter said. \u201cSo, the amount of data that goes in and out of the individual data centers is becoming larger and larger and servers are becoming overwhelmed, and that\u2019s because they have not really been built with that in mind.\u201d For example, his research involves working to redesign the operating system for faster IO devices. \u201cHardware architects have been building better and better networking and storage technologies that become faster, but there are still a few pieces missing,\u201d he said. \u201cOne piece is the design of the operating system, which has become a bottleneck to all of this because it was totally designed with the assumption that IO devices are slow.\u201d Data centers are becoming more important because everyday applications such as email and webs searches use data centers, according to Peter. \u201cWe have transformed into a completely digital society, and everybody\u2019s making use of digital services,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main driver to all of this is that society has basically become dependent on the data center.\u201d Peter attributes his interest in the practical operating systems side of computer science to playing with the Linux operating system. \u201cThat was a big thing for me when it came out, because it was freely available, anybody could play with it and try to make it better,\u201d he said. \u201cI had done this as a hobby for some time, and once I had discovered that you can do this as a Ph.D. and do research in this, I was hooked.\u201d This spring, Peter introduced a project-based operating systems class to undergrad CS students. In the class, students are given the beginning of an operating system and have to build the rest themselves. \u201cI will give them a little bit of guidance, especially in the beginning there will be some milestones that they have to complete,\u201d he said. \u201cTowards the end, it will become more and more freeform and they can go off and design it in the way that they like.\u201d To finish the class, they had to present and defend their operating system to Peter and the teaching assistants in order to practice how computer scientists and engineers must defend their work while researching or working in the industry. \u201cI strongly believe that in a practical kind of science like systems, you learn best by doing things rather than reading a book about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that students actually work on and implement a small operating system in this class to learn more about how low-level systems engineering is done.\u201d As a researcher, Peter likes interacting and collaborating with colleagues both in academia and in the industry. He said in operating systems research, collaboration is helpful because systems problems can become very complex and require a lot of implementation work. \u201cYou work in teams on most of these problems rather than just being by yourself and studying it by yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, in order to get things of this scale done, you can\u2019t do it all on your own, you have to be able to work with other people.\u201d News Categories Faculty Tags Simon Peter new faculty",

    "text_content": "Quantum Computing Might Be Here Sooner Than You Think | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Quantum Computing Might Be Here Sooner Than You Think Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, June 14, 2017 From Bloomberg Markets | by Jon Asmundsson Teams at startups, universities,  government labs, and companies like IBM are racing to build computers that could potentially solve some problems that are now intractable. It\u2019s a sunny Tuesday morning in late March at IBM\u2019s Thomas J. Watson Research Center. The \u00adcorridor from the reception area follows the long, curving glass curtain-wall that looks out over the visitors\u2019 parking lot to leafless trees covering a distant hill in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., an hour north of Manhattan. Walk past the podium from the Jeopardy! episodes at which IBM\u2019s Watson smote the human champion of the TV quiz show, turn right into a hallway, and you\u2019ll enter a windowless lab where a quantum computer is chirping away. Actually, \u201cchirp\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word. It\u2019s a somewhat metallic sound, chush \u2026 chush \u2026 chush, that\u2019s made by the equipment that lowers the temperature inside a so-called dilution \u00adrefrigerator to within hailing distance of absolute zero. Encapsulated in a white canister suspended from a frame, the dilution refrigerator cools a superconducting chip studded with a handful of quantum bits, or qubits. Quantum computing has been around, in theory if not in practice, for several decades. But these new types of machines, designed to harness quantum mechanics and potentially process unimaginable amounts of data, are certifiably a big deal. \u201cI would argue that a working quantum computer is perhaps the most sophisticated \u00adtechnology that humans have ever built,\u201d says Chad Rigetti, founder and chief executive officer of Rigetti Computing, a startup in Berkeley, Calif. Quantum computers, he says, harness nature at a level we became aware of only about 100 years ago\u2014one that isn\u2019t apparent to us in everyday life. What\u2019s more, the potential of quantum computing is enormous. Tapping into the weird way nature works could potentially speed up computing so some problems that are now intractable to classical computers could finally yield solutions. And maybe not just for chemistry and materials science. With practical \u00adbreakthroughs in speed on the horizon, Wall Street\u2019s antennae are twitching. The second investment that CME Group Inc.\u2019s venture arm ever made was in 1QB Information Technologies Inc., a \u00adquantum-computing software company in Vancouver. \u201cFrom the start at CME Ventures, we\u2019ve been looking further ahead at \u00adtransformational innovations and technologies that we think could have an impact on the financial-services industry in the future,\u201d says Rumi Morales, head of CME Ventures LLC. That 1QBit financing round, in 2015, was led by Royal Bank of Scotland. Kevin Hanley, RBS\u2019s director of innovation, says quantum computing is likely to have the biggest impact on industries that are data-rich and time-sensitive. \u201cWe think financial services is kind of in the cross hairs of that profile,\u201d he says. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is an investor in D-Wave Systems Inc., another quantum player, as is In-Q-Tel, the CIA-backed venture capital company, says Vern Brownell, CEO of D-Wave. The Burnaby, B.C.-based company makes machines that do something called quantum annealing. \u201cQuantum annealing is basically using the quantum computer to solve optimization problems at the lowest level,\u201d Brownell says. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a slightly different approach where we\u2019re actually trying to engage with customers, make our computers more and more powerful, and provide this advantage to them in the form of a programmable, usable computer.\u201d Marcos L\u00f3pez de Prado, a senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners LLC who\u2019s also a scientific adviser at 1QBit and a research fellow at the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, says it\u2019s all about context. \u201cThe reason quantum computing is so exciting is its perfect marriage with machine learning,\u201d he says. \u201cI would go as far as to say that currently this is the main application for quantum computing.\u201d Part of that simply derives from the idea of a quantum computer: harnessing a physical device to find an answer, L\u00f3pez de Prado says. He sometimes explains it by pointing to the video game Angry Birds. When you play it on your iPad, the central processing units use some mathematical equations that have been programmed into a library to simulate the effects of gravity and the interaction of objects bouncing and colliding. \u201cThis is how digital computers work,\u201d he says. By contrast, quantum computers turn that approach on its head, L\u00f3pez de Prado says. The paradigm for quantum \u00adcomputers is this: Let\u2019s throw some birds and see what happens. Encode into the quantum microchip this problem: These are your birds and where you throw them from, so what\u2019s the optimal trajectory? \u201cThen you let the computer check all possible solutions \u00adessentially\u2014or a very large combination of them\u2014and come back with an answer,\u201d he says. In a quantum computer, there\u2019s no mathematician cracking the problem, he says. \u201cThe laws of physics crack the problem for you.\u201d The fundamental building blocks of our world are quantum mechanical. \u201cIf you look at a molecule,\u201d says Dario Gil, vice president for science and solutions at IBM Research, \u201cthe reason molecules form and are stable is because of the interactions of these electron orbitals. Each calculation in there\u2014each orbital\u2014is a quantum mechanical calculation.\u201d The number of those calculations, in turn, increases exponentially with the number of electrons you\u2019re trying to model. By the time you have 50 \u00adelectrons, you have 2 to the 50th power calculations, Gil says. \u201cThat\u2019s a phenomenally large number, so we can\u2019t compute it today,\u201d he says. (For the record, it\u2019s 1.125 quadrillion. So if you fired up your laptop and started cranking through several calculations a second, it would take a few million years to run through them all.) Connecting information theory to physics could provide a path to solving such problems, Gil says. A 50-qubit quantum computer might begin to be able to do it. Landon Downs, president and co-founder of 1QBit, says it\u2019s now becoming possible to unlock the computational power of the quantum world. \u201cThis has huge implications for producing new materials or creating new drugs, because we can actually move from a paradigm of discovery to a new era of quantum design,\u201d he says in an email. Rigetti, whose company is building hybrid \u00adquantum-classical machines, says one moonshot use of quantum computing could be to model catalysts that remove carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere\u2014and thereby help fix global warming. (Bloomberg Beta LP, a venture capital unit of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Rigetti Computing.) The quantum-computing community hums with activity and excitement these days. Teams around the world\u2014at startups, corporations, universities, and government labs\u2014are racing to build machines using a welter of different approaches to process quantum information. Superconducting qubit chips too elementary for you? How about trapped ions, which have brought together researchers from the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology? Or maybe the topological approach that Microsoft Corp. is developing through an inter\u00adnational effort called Station Q? The aim is to harness a particle called a non-abelian anyon\u2014which has not yet been definitively proven to exist. These are early days, to be sure. As of late May, the number of quantum computers in the world that clearly, unequivocally do something faster or better than a classical computer remains zero, according to Scott Aaronson , a professor of computer science and director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Such a signal event would establish \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d In Aaronson\u2019s words: \u201cThat we don\u2019t have yet.\u201d Yet someone may accomplish the feat as soon as this year. Most insiders say one clear favorite is a group at Google Inc. led by John Martinis, a physics professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. According to Martinis, the group\u2019s goal is to achieve supremacy with a 49-qubit chip. As of late May, he says, the team was testing a 22-qubit processor as an intermediate step toward a showdown with a classical supercomputer. \u201cWe are optimistic about this, since prior chips have worked well,\u201d he said in an email. The idea of using quantum mechanics to process information dates back decades. One key event happened in 1981, when International Business Machines Corp. and MIT co-sponsored a conference on the physics of computation at the university\u2019s Endicott House in Dedham, Mass. At the conference, Richard Feynman, the famed physicist, proposed building a quantum computer. \u201cNature isn\u2019t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you\u2019d better make it quantum mechanical,\u201d he said in his talk. \u201cAnd by golly, it\u2019s a wonderful problem, because it doesn\u2019t look so easy.\u201d He got that part right. The basic idea is to take advantage of a couple of the weird properties of the \u00adatomic realm: superposition and entanglement. Superposition is the mind-bending observation that a particle can be in two states at the same time. Bring out your ruler to get a measurement, however, and the particle will collapse into one state or the other. And you won\u2019t know which until you try, except in terms of probabilities. This effect is what underlies Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, the \u00adthought-experiment animal that\u2019s both alive and dead in a box until you sneak a peek. Sure, bending your brain around that one doesn\u2019t come especially easy; nothing in everyday life works that way, of course. Yet about 1 million experiments since the early 20th century show that superposition is a thing. And if superposition happens to be your thing, the next step is figuring out how to strap such a crazy concept into a harness. Enter qubits. Classical bits can be a 0 or a 1; run a string of them together through \u201clogic gates\u201d (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), and you\u2019ll multiply numbers, draw an image, and whatnot. A qubit, by contrast, can be a 0, a 1, or both at the same time, says IBM\u2019s Gil. Ready for entanglement? (You\u2019re in good company if you balk; Albert Einstein famously rebelled against the idea, calling it \u201cspooky action at a distance.\u201d) Well, let\u2019s say two qubits were to get entangled; Gil says that would make them perfectly correlated. A quantum computer could then utilize a menagerie of distinctive logic gates. The so-called Hadamard gate, for example, puts a qubit into a state of perfect superposition. (There may be something called a \u201csquare root of NOT\u201d gate, but let\u2019s take a pass on that one.) If you tap the superposition and entanglement in clever arrangements of the weird quantum gates, you start to get at the potential power of quantum computing. If you have two qubits, you can explore four states: 00, 01, 10, and 11. (Note that that\u2019s 4: 2 raised to the power 2.) \u201cWhen I perform a logical operation on my quantum computer, I can operate on all of this at once,\u201d Gil says. And the number of states you can look at is 2 raised to the power of the number of qubits. So if you could make a 50-qubit universal quantum computer, you could in theory explore all of those 1.125 quadrillion states\u2014at the same time. What gives quantum computing its special advantage, says Aaronson, of the University of Texas, is that quantum mechanics is based on things called amplitudes. \u201cAmplitudes are sort of like probabilities, but they can also be negative\u2014in fact, they can also be complex numbers,\u201d he says. So if you want to know the probability that something will happen, you add up the amplitudes for all the different ways that it can happen, he says. \u201cThe idea with a quantum computation is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference so that for each wrong answer to your problem, some paths leading there have positive amplitudes and some have negative amplitudes, so they cancel each other out,\u201d Aaronson says. \u201cWhereas the paths leading to the right answer all have amplitudes that are in phase with each other.\u201d The tricky part is that you have to arrange everything not knowing in advance which answer is the right one. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s the exponentiality of quantum states combined with this potential for interference between positive and negative amplitudes\u2014that\u2019s really the source of the power of quantum computing,\u201d he says. Did we mention that there are problems that a classical \u00adcomputer can\u2019t solve? You probably harness one such difficulty every day when you use encryption on the internet. The problem is that it\u2019s not easy to find the prime factors of a large number. To review: The prime factors of 15 are 5 and 3. That\u2019s easy. If the number you\u2019re trying to factor has, say, 200 digits, it\u2019s very hard. Even with your laptop running an excellent algorithm, you might have to wait years to find the prime factors. That brings us to another milestone in quantum computing: Shor\u2019s algorithm. Published in 1994 by Peter Shor, now a math professor at MIT, the algorithm demonstrated an approach that you could use to find the factors of a big number\u2014if you had a quantum computer, which didn\u2019t exist at the time. Essentially, Shor\u2019s algorithm would perform some operations that would point to the regions of numbers in which the answer was most likely to be found. The following year, Shor also discovered a way to perform quantum error correction. \u201cThen people really got the idea that, wow, this is a different way of computing things and is more powerful in certain test cases,\u201d says Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Yale Quantum Institute and Sterling professor of applied \u00adphysics and physics. \u201cThen there was a big upswelling of interest from the physics community to figure out how you could make quantum bits and logic gates between quantum bits and all of those things.\u201d Two decades later, those things are here.

The ACL2 Workshop series is the major technical forum for users of the ACL2 theorem proving system to present research related to the ACL2 theorem prover and its applications. ACL2 is an industrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers. The 2005 ACM Software System Award was awarded to Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore for their work in ACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family. ACL2-2017 was a two-day workshop. It was the 14th in the series of ACL2 workshops, which occur approximately every 18 months. The workshop featured technical papers, keynote talks, and rump sessions discussing ongoing research.

    "text_content": "New Faculty Profile: Vijay Chidambaram | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Faculty Profile: Vijay Chidambaram Posted by Eric Lee on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 Vijay Chidambaram did not start off wanting to go into research. While earning his Bachelor\u2019s from the College of Engineering, Guindy in India in 2009, Chidambaram focused on his goal of nabbing a job at a big company. After an internship during his Master\u2019s studies, Chidambaram realized that working as a software engineer did not appeal to him as much as he expected. He felt there was a better way for him to impact the world. As a Master\u2019s student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Chidambaram discovered a passion for teaching and research. He found that he enjoyed the high level of control he had with his work while having flexibility over the topics his research covered. Chidambaram focused his research on operating systems at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and did several research-based internships with Microsoft before graduating with a Ph.D. in 2015. Thereafter, Chidambaram brought his expertise to VMware, building an innovative tool that impacts future applications for non-volatile memory technologies by providing an easy-to-use-framework for their development. In Fall of 2016, after his research at VMware, Chidambaram seized the opportunity to become an assistant professor at UT Computer Science. \u201cUT has a great computer science department,\u201d Chidambaram says, \u201cand the surrounding area is a great place to have an interesting life outside of CS.\u201d In the short time that he has been at UT, Chidambaram has done many notable things for the department. Working closely with the faculty and staff, Chidambaram has helped design an upper division elective in the area of computer systems as well as give feedback on the designs on two to three other classes that will be implemented in fall of 2017. \u201cHe has helped design new classes for students who want to continue to pursue studies related to our classes for 429 and 439,\u201d Director Bruce Porter says. Additionally, Chidambaram helped establish a research lab where his research students can focus on topics related to operating systems, such as file systems, distributed systems, and virtualization. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I hope to do in my time here,\u201d Chidambaram says. \u201cI hope to revamp the computer science syllabus and help students get hands-on experience in topics I will teach, such as virtualization, or how storage works. Additionally, since technology is moving so fast, I want to build a strong research group, not just purely academic, where research will affect the industry.\u201d As a researcher, Chidambaram\u2019s work has not gone unnoticed. Just last year, Chidambaram received the widely acclaimed SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Dissertation Award for his doctoral dissertation in \u201c Orderless and Eventually Durable File Systems \u201d.  In that dissertation, Chidambaram presented a method to decouple the ordering of streams of data from durability. So, even when an operating system loses its power, data does not disappear. In doing so this discovery was able to improve the performance of machines by over tenfold. Not long after that, Chidambaram was also awarded a Best Paper Award by FAST organizers and USENIX for his research in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Application Crash Consistency and Performance with CCFS (an overview can be found in The Morning Paper\u2019s blog ). In his research paper, Chidambaram and his team were able to recognize the abstraction of a stream and guarantee, with streams of data, that the ordering of that data would be set. Chidambaram stresses the importance of why operating systems are so awe-inspiring. \u201cAn operating system is what makes computers run. If you are able to work with an operating system, you can get computers to do pretty much whatever you want,\u201d Chidambaram says. \u201cIf you are able to work with operating systems, you essentially become a wizard in CS.\u201d News Categories Faculty Tags Faculty Profile Vijay Chidambaram operating systems Research VMware",

    "text_content": "The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Machine Learning in Computer Systems Research | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Machine Learning in Computer Systems Research Posted by Keshav Pingali on Thursday, April 6, 2017 In 1960, the physicist Eugene Wigner wrote a famous essay titled \u201c The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences \u201d in which he explored the question of why mathematics is so remarkably useful in the natural sciences. A contemporary example of such \u201cunreasonable effectiveness\u201d is the success that machine learning has had in transforming many disciplines in the past decade. Particularly impressive is the progress in autonomous vehicles. In the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles, which popularized the idea of driverless cars, none of the vehicles was able to complete a relatively simple route through the Mojave Desert, and I thought it unlikely that I would see driverless cars operating in urban environments in my lifetime. Since that time, progress in this area has been phenomenal, thanks to rapid advances in using machine learning for sensing and navigation (and in building low-cost sensors and controls). Driverless long-haul trucks are apparently just a few years away, and the main worry now is not so much the safety of these trucks but the specter of unemployment facing millions of people currently employed as truck drivers. In contrast to these astonishing changes, the impact of machine learning on traditional Computer Science areas like computer architecture, operating systems, and programming languages has been minimal. By this, I don\u2019t mean that computer architects and systems designers have ignored machine learning. Systems like GraphLab and Galois have been designed to make it easier to write machine learning applications on high-performance parallel platforms. The architecture community is exploring energy-efficient implementations of deep neural nets , and last year\u2019s ISCA had no fewer than three sessions on architectures for deep neural nets! What these examples show however is that good systems research can have an impact on the implementation of machine learning applications; what I am looking for are examples of how the systems area has been transformed by machine learning. Here\u2019s the kind of thing I have in mind. Back in 2001, my colleague Calvin Lin and his student Daniel Jimenez used a perceptron for branch prediction, and they showed that their predictor was more accurate than conventional predictors like two-bit counters because it was more effective at exploiting long branch histories. AMD uses a perceptron-based predictor in their new Ryzen processor (I should point out though that the 2016 Branch Predictor Championship was won by Andre Seznec\u2019s TAGE predictor , which beat all perceptron-based predictors!). Another example is the use of regression techniques from machine learning to build models of program behavior. If I replace 64-bit arithmetic with 32-bit arithmetic in a program, how much does it change the output of the program and how much does it reduce energy consumption? For many programs, it is not feasible to build analytical models to answer these kinds of questions (among other things, the answers are usually dependent on the input values), but if you have a lot of training data, Xin Sui has shown that you can often use regression to build (non-linear) proxy functions to answer these kinds of questions fairly accurately. Neither of these examples however is a truly transformative use of machine learning in systems building. By transformative, I mean something that causes people to wonder whether computer architects, programmers, compiler writers or operating systems builders will soon be joining truck drivers and limo drivers in the unemployment line! It is possible that I am wrong and that machine learning has already revolutionized some aspects of systems building. If so, I welcome your feedback about these revolutions, and I will summarize the more interesting responses in my next blog post. But if I am not wrong and the revolution has not yet begun, isn\u2019t it time to get to work?

    "text_content": "New Faculty Profile: Scott Niekum | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Faculty Profile: Scott Niekum Posted by Julianne Hodges on Wednesday, April 5, 2017 UTCS Assistant Professor Scott Niekum has known he wanted to study artificial intelligence since he was 19 years old. As an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, he rode the bus an hour each way to get to his internship. To pass the time, he read Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach , a book that explores, among other topics, artificial intelligence and the emergence of consciousness. \u201cIt was that book that really got me interested to the level of me thinking, this is something I really want to do someday,\u201d Niekum said. Niekum uses machine learning to teach robots from human demonstrations. As the director of the Personal Autonomous Robotics Laboratory , he and his fellow researchers test methods for training robots to do everyday human tasks from cleaning to assembling IKEA furniture. Niekum\u2019s research focuses on using demonstrations to show robots what to do instead of programming each behavior with code. If it learns from demonstrations, a robot that has been deployed in a home or workplace will not require a robotics expert to add to or change its programming. \u201cEven for experts, it\u2019s really hard to sit down and write code that describes, what is a good tennis swing?\u201d Niekum said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to leverage expertise that people already have. You take somebody who is decent at tennis, and if they can show the robot how to do the task, it\u2019s much easier to capture human intuition \u2026 than try to write down some set of rules for what makes a good tennis swing.\u201d Artificial intelligence could make people more productive and improve lives by means such as by taking care of people and improving medical diagnoses, according to Niekum. \u201cWe can use AI algorithms to optimize our supply chains and distribution networks, help us optimize farming and understand our own genomes better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revolutionize virtually every area of society that can be optimized or statistically analyzed in some way. It\u2019s going to really give us a superhuman understanding of almost every aspect of our lives.\u201d Part of Niekum\u2019s work is figuring out how to make artificial intelligence and robotics as safe and reliable as possible. One of his goals is to have robots \u201cin the wild\u201d in homes and workplaces that not only learn from their mistakes, but can automatically call up experts when they run into a tough problem. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out ways where we can actually give strong probabilistic guarantees about how safe some policy is to deploy out in the real world,\u201d Niekum said. \u201cIn the next five years, I would really like to see, at least in the Austin area, a pilot program of autonomous robots in people\u2019s homes that can be taught by demonstration reliably \u2026 before we have software that works 100 percent autonomously all the time. If we want to wait for that, we\u2019re going to be waiting for 30 years.\u201d One of the misconceptions about AI is that it will replace humans in the workplace. However, Niekum explained that robotics and artificial intelligence still have difficulties with certain tasks, such as manipulating tiny objects, in fields like cell phone manufacturing. \u201cWhat I think we\u2019re going to see happen in the near-term is that robots are going to augment us a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can supplement humans by doing tedious or difficult work, or work that\u2019s too dangerous for humans to do, like going into a nuclear reactor that\u2019s melting down. You\u2019ll see humans and robots collaborating in a lot of tasks, and you\u2019ll see our capabilities as humans augmented a lot, but it\u2019s not just going to be a full-scale replacement.\u201d Advancements and applications of breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence move quickly, and Niekum\u2019s goal as a professor at UT is to train the next generation of researchers to think critically about machine learning. \u201cI want to bring up students that are diverse enough both in machine learning and in mathematics in general so that they can figure out what that next big breakthrough is going to be,\u201d he said.

    "text_content": "Doing the Math for Better Encryption | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Doing the Math for Better Encryption Posted by Julianne Hodges on Tuesday, May 2, 2017 James Bowe, via Create Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License. From SIGNAL Magazine : A breakthrough formula for generating random numbers may be the key to cybersecurity. They do not necessarily match the hero stereotype, but computer scientists improving methods of generating random numbers just may save the day when it comes to cybersecurity. Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin have delivered a mathematical revelation that could bring a number of benefits, but improved encryption tops the list. Cybersecurity, of course, depends on encryption, which relies on random data. Although the world is full of randomness\u2014a roll of the dice, a flip of a coin, a lottery drawing\u2014randomness is not always equal. When studied over time, air temperatures and stock market results, for example, actually produce predictable patterns. During World War II, American forces constantly broke the Japanese cipher system because the passwords used for its encryption algorithm followed certain patterns. Similarly, in the 1970s, flaws in a widely used algorithm for generating random sequences called into question many scientific results. The Texas scientists, funded by the National Science Foundation, found a way to generate truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods. David Zuckerman, a professor at the university\u2019s computer science department, worked with graduate student Eshan Chattopadhyay on the discovery, which the university announced a year ago after the two shocked the theoretical math world with their results. Generating random numbers is actually difficult for a computer, Zuckerman says, because it executes one instruction after the other in a predetermined way: the opposite of randomness. \u201cFor that reason, computers use ad hoc sources of randomness, such as timing intervals between keystrokes. However, such ad hoc random sources are really only a little bit random,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cIt is, therefore, essential to improve the quality of the random source. Unfortunately, this is impossible with just one generally low-quality random source.\u201d The computer scientists\u2019 approach is an improvement upon randomness extractors, which Zuckerman helped pioneer in the 1990s. Simply stated, an extractor generates a truly random sequence of numbers from a weakly random sequence. The breakthrough method uses two weakly random sources and churns out one sequence of numbers that is statistically close to random. The technique could help make voting machines more secure, ensure more accurate scientific experiments and complex simulations, and better protect encryption keys. \u201cYou want to keep your secret key perfectly secret. If you choose it randomly, the chance of someone guessing it is going to be small,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose it randomly\u2014if you have some deterministic algorithm [such as] your birthday or your phone number\u2014these are algorithms that a hacker can also try, and it makes it a lot easier for the attacker to learn your secret key or your password. To have any provable results in cryptography, you always need randomness.\u201d In theory, the method can improve communication using weakly random sequences. \u201cWith our result, if you have two parties that have independent weak sources of randomness, you can still do what you want. Usually, if you just use these low-quality random sources, they\u2019ll fail. You need to process these before you use them directly,\u201d Zuckerman explains. Previous versions of randomness extractors were less practical because they either required that one of the two source sequences be truly random or that both source sequences be close to truly random. By allowing two weakly random sequences, the new method sidesteps both of those restrictions, according to the university\u2019s written announcement about the breakthrough. \u201cThe quality of the two-source extractor is measured by the quality of the randomness that\u2019s required to make it work. It\u2019s easy to make it work if you use high-quality randomness. The challenge is to make it work even if the quality is very low,\u201d Zuckerman says. The quality of randomness is measured by something called min entropy. The lower the min entropy of the input source, the lower the quality of the input randomness, and the harder it is to extract high-quality randomness. Therefore, a lower min-entropy requirement means a better extractor. For years, no one could get the min entropy below .499. \u201cIt was known how to build a two-source extractor if this number was bigger than one-half, and people were kind of stuck there. Actually, a famous mathematician had improved it to .499. Our results improved it to anything above zero,\u201d Zuckerman adds, citing .000001 as an example. He toiled over this problem off and on for more than 20 years. \u201cEven for my dissertation I was interested in using models of randomness,\u201d he states. The follow-up work to his dissertation involved studying one source of weak randomness that included a very small amount of high-quality randomness. \u201cA small amount of high-quality randomness enables you to extract a lot of high-quality randomness from an otherwise weak source,\u201d Zuckerman reports. \u201cWe were able to make progress, but still, we were stuck on this problem of two sources.\u201d The computer science professor and others continue improving the process. Researchers at Tel Aviv University, for instance, have simplified the method. \u201cThese are theoretical results. They\u2019re mathematical theorems. We published it, and now other people are free to improve it. This is the way progress in research happens,\u201d Zuckerman offers. While the method has been hailed as a major breakthrough, he indicates that he hopes to see further improvements. \u201cThe biggest thing is to get an even simpler construction,\u201d Zuckerman says. He also would like to shrink the error rate, which he describes as polynomially small. \u201cIn cryptography, we like errors that are smaller than any polynomial,\u201d he adds. \u201cEven in the theoretical sense right now, our error is too large. It would be interesting to improve it.\u201d Zuckerman predicts that it may be years before the mathematical method is put to practical use. Its implications could be wide-ranging, he suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s still largely basic research, but randomness is extremely useful to secure systems and do cryptography and secure electronic commerce and in a whole variety of other areas. Improvements here, hopefully, will lead to improvements elsewhere,\u201d he offers. News Categories Faculty Research Undergraduate Students Tags David Zuckerman Eshan Chattopadhyay",

Their work, which was done jointly with researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , shows how data stores can be made more resilient to failures in distributed-systems. Describing the work in informal terms, Chidambaram noted that large distributed systems have many machines that crash and recover constantly, so ensuring correct recovery is challenging. Although distributed systems are adept at recovering from server crashes, the team found that many systems do not recover properly from data corruption; in fact under some failure conditions, corrupted data from a single node spreads to the entire system. Their new approach, which they call \"Protocol-Aware Recovery,\" makes distributed systems more reliable without significant decrease in performance, permitting data to be recovered correctly even if machines in the distributed system crash or storage in the machines gets corrupted.

    "text_content": "Computer science department grows Austin economy | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer science department grows Austin economy Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, March 3, 2017 The Daily Texan UT computer scientists are reprogramming the Austin economy. This month the Austin Chamber of Commerce recognized Bruce Porter, chair of the UT Department of Computer Science, with the Economic Development Volunteer of the Year award. The chamber honored Porter for his work in growing the economy across the Austin region. \u201cDr. Porter has been instrumental in continuing to build the high tech and innovation economy throughout Austin,\u201d said Luke Sheffield, public relations manager for the Chamber, in an email. Porter helps recruit technology companies to come to Austin. He said that during his eight years as chair of the computer science department, the tech sector of central Texas experienced a surge. \u201cI meet with a lot of the companies when they consider moving to Austin, and they grill me about what the education is like, where the students go (after graduation), and whether we have capacity to produce more graduates,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe\u2019re a really big department, and we\u2019re a strong department, and that is a major reason why the tech companies are coming here.\u201d Sheffield said that Porter and his team were instrumental in meeting with prospective companies such as Conde Nast Digital Innovation Center, LiveOps and others who consider Austin as a home for their businesses. \u201cIn the 21st century, the future is owned by technology, and if a region, city or state is not doing everything they can to grow their tech sector, they\u2019re going to be left hopelessly behind,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEveryone talks about trying to become the next Silicon Valley, and maybe someday we will become that. But there\u2019s significant ways to go before then.\u201d Porter said he believes the award is really recognizing the role of UT\u2019s whole computer science department in boosting Austin\u2019s technology economy. \u201cThe (computer science) department as a whole produces a lot of local talent in students, who are trained with a really good education, and that\u2019s what\u2019s powering the local tech economy,\u201d Porter said. Computer science freshman Ann Yue said the computer science department encourages internships, particularly local ones. \u201c(The department) places a pretty heavy emphasis on internships with local companies, and (has) recruitment posters in the building on an almost daily basis,\u201d Yue said. \u201cThe local tech company is really fueled by the number of grads that come out of (the program).\u201d Porter said that just as important as having a strong university, is having a vibrant entrepreneurial community and venture capital for launching new companies. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there, and I was delighted a few years ago when (former) President Barack Obama visited, because Austin is one of the few cities that has a chance to become a Silicon Valley,\u201d Porter said. In 2013, Obama visited Austin\u2019s Capital Factory, where students from Longhorn Startup, an entrepreneur class led by Joshua Baer, pitched their company ideas to him. One of the groups that pitched to Obama were the founders of Lynx Laboratories, who developed a camera that could generate 3-D models. \u201cLynx Laboratories was so successful that (the students) have already sold their company for $300 million dollars,\u201d Porter said. \u201cLater, they got it down to a software-only implementation, that would run on something like a cellphone.\u201d According to Porter, students like those who started up Lynx Laboratories are the biggest assets to expanding the local tech community. Yue said that Austin is an appealing city for computer science majors. \u201cThe cost of living is lower compared to California, and most of the major tech companies are starting to, or have already built offices in Austin, so there wouldn\u2019t be a lack of choices,\u201d she said. According to Porter, it\u2019s this cycle of mutual attraction between new companies and UT graduates that drives the growth in the local tech economy. \u201cCompanies are looking for a talent pool, a place where they\u2019ll be able to find and recruit computer science talents, and that includes finding a place where people in high demand will choose to live,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for places where that kind of talent is produced, and those people will choose perhaps to stay in that town. Austin wins on those kinds of dimensions\u2014it\u2019s a cool town, it\u2019s where people want to live, and we\u2019re producing a lot of these talents.\u201d News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Industry Relations Undergraduate Students Tags local economy tech industry Bruce Porter entrepreneurship",

This is part of a series featuring personal profiles of the new faculty at UT Computer Science Chris Rossbach didn\u2019t take a common path to computer science research. He tried out physics, philosophy, math and religious studies before graduating from Stanford University with a computer science degree. Rossbach didn\u2019t see a job for himself in computers, though, so he became a professional musician and yoga teacher. However, after 13 years of working more and more with computers in his spare time, he finally decided to pursue computer science as a career. \u201cMany people come to realize who they are as a professional much quicker, but at least I have a high confidence result,\u201d he said. Rossbach joined UTCS this fall as an assistant professor. He currently studies operating systems and how to reorganize systems to work better. He solves problems with these systems by looking at how all of the parts fit together. \u201cThis is one way of really saying, I\u2019m interested in operating systems, because that\u2019s what a computer operating system does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the layer that makes all the things you can see work together.\u201d In the past, he has worked on GPUs, or graphics processing units, the components that help draw detailed frames of video in video games. He tried to work on repurposing GPUs for image processing and computer vision, but found that the operating system was hard to work with, so he spent years restructuring the operating system. \u201cThat was a lot of work but a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to build big systems that potentially take many years, but that solve really large-scale problems and interact with lots of layers of technology.\u201d He started out by playing with new technology in order to see what it can do and how it can improve. One of these past projects was finding a more intuitive input method for 3D cameras. \u201cAs I got deeper and deeper into that problem, it turned out to be much less about the snazzy new camera that attracted me and much more about the structure of all the components,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turned out to reveal what I think are some fundamental flaws in the way modern operating systems are currently designed.\u201d Computer scientists need to change the way they think about OS structures in order to adapt to new technology, according to Rossbach. Adapting basic CPU systems with traditional storage and network systems doesn\u2019t work that well anymore, he said, because of more specialized hardware and software in devices like cell phones and the trend towards moving information to distributed cloud systems. \u201cI think we\u2019re now at a point where it\u2019s just not going to fly anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep just hacking at the problem and making piecemeal changes. These two forces of lower-level specialization and higher-level distribution are in tension, and they\u2019re pulling apart at the seams the fabric that has been around for a long time.\u201d Rossbach said these current challenges make today an interesting time in systems research. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a good time to be working in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make a splash, because there\u2019s so much openness in the problem space. If [students] are interested in operating systems, come talk to me, the door\u2019s always open.\u201d News Categories Faculty Tags Chris Rossbach new faculty operating systems",

Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, an assistant professor who joined UTCS last fall, studies a subfield of machine learning called computer vision. By using machine learning techniques, such as deep networks, computers can learn how to differentiate between and manipulate images by running through a large data set of labeled images. \"One of the biggest issues there is that the amount of data you need to teach the computer about even tiny little things is enormous,\" he said. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl's research specifically focuses on how to reduce the number of labels needed. \"The issue is not getting the images, they're for free,\" he explained. \"[The issue is] getting the labels, or getting the supervision to teach the computer what you want it to see.\" In October, he and researchers from the University of California Berkeley, where Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl completed his postdoctoral work, presented their machine learning research at the European Conference on Computer Vision in Amsterdam. This research explored using machine learning to edit images to look realistic. \"For example, you want to edit the image of a shoe and you want to make it white,\" he demonstrated. \"If you make parts of the shoe white, it will automatically adjust the entire shoe to be white, because that\u2019s a realistic change. If you deform parts of the shoe, it will automatically adjust the shape of the shoe so that it looks like a realistic-looking shoe.\" Using programs like Photoshop to edit and create realistic images is a \"pretty painful process,\" according to Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, but using a computer with a machine learning program makes the process easier. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl also researches using these machine learning techniques to create entirely new images. For example, if a user tells the computer they want a landscape, by drawing a few simple lines that represent a mountain, the computer's algorithm will create an image of a mountain that resembles the input. A machine learning algorithm can also fill in missing pieces from an image. \"For example, if I take this bottle and I hide it from you and I ask you, what might be behind my hands? If you are able to say that this is a bottle, you actually understand a lot about the visual world. You understand that bottles need to be on tables, you understand what bottles look like. \"It actually teaches you something about the visual world if you\u2019re able to do this task very, very well,\" he added. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl believes computer vision is the most important field of machine learning. He hopes computers someday gain enough understanding through computer vision that they can observe and understand human actions. \"All of what machine learning does, in some sense, is trying to understand certain aspects of our world or certain patterns in our world,\" he explained. \"To me, the visual signal is the most interesting one, because we humans heavily rely on it and it's how we define our world.\" Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl has noticed that the field of computer vision has been growing over the past five years. \"The funniest indicator of this is the size of the conferences and the amount of industry interest in the kind of work we're doing,\" he said. \"About five years ago, nobody was really interested in computer vision, because it was something that people in academia [did], it was never going to work in the real world for anything. I think machine learning now has become a center of attention for computer science in the past few years because things are starting to work.\" News Categories Faculty",

The Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers which offers a verified certificate of completion for a small fee or is free audits, was launched by edX, UT\u2019s non-profit partner which manages MOOCs in January of 2015. By linking the theory of linear algebra to issues that arise when implementing high-performance software libraries, the course content connects the mathematics to issues encountered in computer architecture, software engineering, and program correctness. The course builds on ongoing research by the instructors on how to develop and implement high-performance linear algebra libraries, funded by the National Science Foundation, so that the participant is simultaneously exposed to introductory material and the cutting edge of the field. In reviewing this course, one student wrote: \"This course operates at three levels, I think. First, it helps you get some important principles around computational science and why efficient algorithms are fundamental to computation. Second, it gives you the rationale, foundations, and logic about the principles of matrix manipulation. And third, certainly not least, you get to learn the mathematics and specific practical skills to work with matrices and linear algebra.\" Later in the spring, on April 11, 2017, Robert and Maggie launch a new MOOC, LAFF-On Programming for Correctness, which presents goal-oriented programming the way Edsger Dijkstra intended.  The course shows how to make the formal derivation of algorithms practical for a broad class of matrix operations and will leave you pondering how results extend to other domains.

    "text_content": "Undergraduate Experience Prepares Alumnus to Launch Startup | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Undergraduate Experience Prepares Alumnus to Launch Startup Posted by Spoorthi Krishnaraj on Tuesday, May 26, 2020 UT alumni Denis Ignatovich (right) and Grant Passmore (left) On August 1, 2012, the global financial services firm Knight Capital, which was at the time the largest trader in U.S. equities, lost $460 million due to a \u201ctechnology breakdown.\u201d One of their trading servers housed defective code, causing the group irreparable damage. Almost exactly a year later, a Goldman Sachs computer glitch resulted in a number of erroneous trades, resulting in a loss of over $100 million for the company. \u201cAt the time, there were a lot of these technical glitches plaguing the financial markets,\u201d explains Texas Computer Science (TXCS) alum Denis Ignatovich . \u201cPeople commit a bad line of code or misconfigure something, and all of a sudden these whole firms just go under.\u201d During that period, Ignatovich> was working in London, and was running Deutsche Bank\u2019s central risk trading desk for Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a trading desk that runs a big quantitative trading platform,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means a lot of calculations, a lot of source code that\u2019s constantly being changed, things like that.\u201d Being the head of the desk meant that Ignatovich was ultimately responsible if something went wrong. He spent a lot of his time manually checking various edge cases for the algorithms that were used, which involved complex logic. At the same time, Ignatovich\u2019s roommate from UT Austin, Grant Olney Passmore , was conducting research at the University of Cambridge on the formal verification of autopilot systems and their safety properties. \u201cI was in London, he was in Cambridge - It wasn't planned like that, but the both of us just ended up together again,\u201d says Ignatovich. Passmore and Ignatovich had met through a mutual friend when they were both undergraduate students at UT Austin. Ignatovich has fond memories of the time they spent together in Taylor Hall, the old UT Computer Science building. \u201cIf you went downstairs to the basement there were these student areas, the lab, and student organization offices. That's where people would get together to work on whatever,\u201d he recalls. Passmore and Ignatovich managed to procure a basement office for themselves. They set it up with servers, a record player, etc., and they would play jazz music as they worked on various projects together - Passmore focusing on computer science and mathematical logic, while Ignatovich worked on applications in finance. In 2007, Ignatovich graduated with a dual degree in computer science and finance, and moved to New York to work on Wall Street as a quantitative analyst for Deutsche Bank. Two years later, he was transferred to his role in London. Passmore graduated from UT with a degree in mathematics, then pursued a PhD degree in computer science and informatics from the University of Edinburgh, finally proceeding to conduct research at the University of Cambridge. For years after they graduated, the two of them would talk about resuming work on their projects. But once they were both in the UK and started to see the magnitude of the problem in financial markets, they decided to actually follow it through. \u201cIt goes back all the way to the projects that we\u2019d work on together,\u201d says Ignatovich. Ignatovich and Passmore realized that there was a deep connection between what they were both working on. They figured that they could automate those formal verification techniques and put them into the hands of engineers within financial markets in such a way that wouldn\u2019t require advanced training. \u201cWhat we set out to do was to create a company that democratizes access to this technology,\u201d says Ignatovich. The basic premise was that someone could write code, which their engine would translate to mathematical logic, allowing the user to answer deep questions about how the code would behave. For example, when applied to a trading system like what Goldman Sachs runs, the engineer could ask a question such as, \u201cAre there any sequences of inputs that will lead this platform to generate a trade with a negative price?\u201d and proceed from there. In 2014, the duo co-founded the startup Imandra that focused on this problem. Imandra\u2019s core technology built upon existing work in the field done by people like J Strother Moore and Robert S. Boyer , who had advised and taught both Ignatovich and Passmore at UT Austin. Still, the process of creating a company from the ground-up has, naturally, been extremely challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to write code. It\u2019s something else entirely to say \u2018We have this vision, and we\u2019re going to go after it for five years\u2019,\u201d says Ignatovich. \u201cFor that, you have to be persistent and self-confident. Those things come from experience.\u201d Ignatovich cites his time as a CS student at UT, especially in the Turing Scholars program, as having a profound effect on him in this respect. \u201cYou go through this process where you\u2019re together with a bunch of people that are mostly smarter than you. And you go through these insanely difficult things, always getting through them,\u201d he says. \u201cNumber one, that builds discipline, and number two, you\u2019re just humbled by the people you get to work with. It makes you realize that stuff in the real world is difficult - you have a lot of competition and you\u2019ve got to put in the effort. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do what I do today if I hadn't gone through that\u2026 you\u2019ve got to train for the marathons.\u201d Last year, Imandra relocated its headquarters to Austin, and Ignatovich is hopeful for the growth that the move will bring for the company in United States markets.

    "text_content": "New Faculty Profile: Qixing Huang | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Faculty Profile: Qixing Huang Posted by Julianne Hodges on Friday, December 2, 2016 \u200bThe University of Texas at Austin has committed resources to expanding faculty and research strength in the increasingly important field of machine perception. Machine perception, a broad concept that actually incorporates multiple disciplines such as natural language processing and computer vision and underlying machine learning technologies, is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on how computer systems intake information, particular in ways that emulate human behavior. Qixing Huang , one of the first of these new faculty members , brings a unique perspective on how to integrate computer vision techniques more closely with the field of 3-D graphics. Huang's work involves scanning physical objects in order to transform them into 3-D models on a computer. In order to take a 3-D object and turn it into a 3-D computer model, all angles of the object must be captured with 2-D images, which are then fused together to give a complete picture of the object. According to Huang, this is one of the more difficult challenges associated with capturing 3-D objects directly from the physical world. Fortunately, the field of 3-D graphics could get a little help from another field of computer science: artificial intelligence. \u201cWhen you look at the geometry of an object from a particular angle, you only see a partial object, you don\u2019t have a complete knowledge of that object,\u201d he said. \u201cTo really acquire a 3-dimensional geometry, you have to look at that from multiple angles. How to fuse the information acquired from multiple angles into a completed geometry is a very interesting problem that has been studied for a very long time and is still ongoing.\u201d The abundance of data from the internet has recently improved 3-D computer modeling. When Huang started doing this research ten years ago, he only had a few 3-D models on his computer, and he said research was focused on processing and improving a single object at a time. Now, crowd-sourcing 3-D modeling data from the internet that people share led to millions of models online on websites such as 3D Warehouse . \u201cNow we have big data, which is new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can think about how to leverage big data to develop data-driven algorithms to acquire, process and analyze 3-dimensional models. How can we manage this data to solve existing problems, or even create new problems to work on?\u201d He says these big data solutions can also be applied to other disciplines, such as computational biology and bioinformatics, where scientists can solve traditional problems in biology by using computer science techniques such as algorithms and simulations with lots of data. \u201cBecause of this big geometric data, we may open new machine-learning problems that interest people from theoretical computer science and theoretical machine-learning divisions to work on.\u201d He says that an alternative solution is using robotics and artificial intelligence to improve the process, such as creating moving robots with sensors attached in place of handheld 3-D cameras to capture the environment. Huang wants to work across disciplines between the fields of robotics and graphics. An application of this cross-disciplinary work is being able to capture a 3-D object or environment by writing text descriptions instead of clicking buttons to control the scanning mechanism. \u201cThere are a few key problems in different areas of computer science, but it turns out that the boundary between different disciplines becomes blurrier and blurrier,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, my major focus is on the intersection of graphics and artificial intelligence.\u201d While at UT, one of Huang\u2019s research goals is to pursue this intersection between AI and graphics, and he wants to develop new classes at UT for this interdisciplinary line of research. Huang said he is enjoying UT so far and looking forward to collaborations, such as in the AI Lab , within and outside of UTCS to further his research goals. \u201cThis is a very good and comprehensive university,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to do something, you can always find experts in this domain. That is the most amazing part of being at UT.\u201d",

Natural language processing (NLP) has long been a pillar of the lab, including in particular the research work of Lab Director Ray Mooney , who focuses on natural language processing and computational linguistics. Natural language processing will be a critical component in the department's new push to expand in the area of machine perception. Machine perception is the capability of a computer system to interpret data from images, sounds, music and video in a manner that is similar to the way humans use their senses to relate to the world around them. Machine perception allows the computer to use this sensory input, as well as conventional computational means of collecting data to gather information with greater accuracy and to present it in a way that is more comfortable for the user. [1] These include natural language processing, computer vision, and the underlying driving technology of machine learning. UT Computer Science has received a commitment from the university to add multiple new faculty from the machine perception field. The department currently has three new faculty slated to join the machine perception program over the next year. Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl , whose research interests lie in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics, will join the department this fall. Starting this fall as well is Qixing Huang , whose research interests are in computer graphics, vision and machine learning. Greg Durrett will be joining the department in fall 2017. His research focuses on statistical natural language processing. These talented individuals join a strong team of fourteen current Artificial Intelligence Laboratory faculty, ensuring that UT Computer Science will continue to be a leader in the field for years to come.

Aaronson is a David J. Bruton Centennial Professor of Computer Science at UT Austin and director of its Quantum Information Center . His research focuses on the capabilities and limits of quantum computers and, more generally, on computational complexity and its relation to physics. Aaronson discusses the future of quantum computing on the Point of Discovery podcast The Simons Investigator program is designed to support outstanding scientists during their most productive years, when they are establishing creative new research directions, providing leadership to the field and effectively mentoring junior scientists. Awardees receive substantial research support of $100,000 per year for a period of five years, with the possibility of renewal for an additional five years if their work shows scientific promise. An additional $10,000 per year is provided to the Investigator's department. Aaronson is the second theoretical computer scientist from UT Austin in two years to receive the prestigious designation. David Zuckerman , also a professor in the department, was one of two Simons Investigators in computer science in 2016. UT Austin is the only public university to have more than one computer scientist named a Simons Investigator in Theoretical Computer Science (the other institutions with more than one are Harvard, Stanford and MIT). Much of Aaronson's recent research has concerned developing tasks that should theoretically be easy for quantum computers, but difficult for conventional computers, and that might be doable in the near future. Google and IBM have both announced plans to work toward this \"quantum supremacy\" \u2014an as-yet-unattained milestone\u2014within the next few years.Aaronson, together with his students, have proposed some of the main examples of quantum supremacy experiments, and proven the difficulty of simulating them with conventional computers. Aaronson received his bachelor's from Cornell University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley before proceeding to postdoctoral fellowships at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University as well as the University of Waterloo. Before coming to UT Austin, he spent nine years as a professor in electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

They competed against a total of 67 teams from 27 schools and 3 states. The first place team, consisting of junior Alex Meed, sophomore Brian Richer and freshman Supawit Chockchowwat will go on to compete at the ACM-ICPC world finals in May in Rapid City, South Dakota. The other three teams included Angela Xie, Arnav Sastry, Brady Zhou, Daniel Talamas, Ethan Arnold, Gene Hsu, Raymond Chee, Veronica Gunn and Wyatt Reeves. Tens of thousands of students from more than two thousand universities across 91 countries participate in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, a team-based, programming competition operating headquartered at Baylor University. The contest consists of teams of three students working together for five hours to solve a number of problems ranging in difficulty that cover a wide variety of real-life applications. \u201cEach competition has a mix of problems that test different skills,\u201d UT Computer Science professor and UTPC coach Etienne Vouga said. \u201cSome problems are raw implementation, where you are given a specification for an algorithm and must write a correct implementation of it. Some require specialized algorithms to solve, and the students must first realize which algorithm is necessary. Some are number theory or geometry problems that must be reasoned out on pen and paper.\u201d This year is the first time that UT has swept the first four positions at the competition and the first time they have won first place at regionals since 2009, although UTPC has consistently landed at least one team in the top 5 almost every year since 2000, according to their website . \u201cUT Austin has had a strong presence at the ICPC Regionals since at least the late 90s, though our strength waxes and wanes,\u201d Vouga said. \u201cFor the last several years, we have come close to going to the finals, but have been edged out by teams from Rice University.\u201d In September, UTPC coaches Vouga, Glenn Downing and Shyamal Mitra selected the best 12 students from open tryouts to compete in three teams in the regional contest. The teams have prepared by practicing in private contests throughout the fall, coach and CS lecturer Glenn Downing said. According to the ACM-ICPC website, the contest fosters creativity, teamwork and innovation in building new software program and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. Participation in the contests can enhance students\u2019 resumes and help them perform better on technical interviews, Downing said. \u201cIt gives them a deeper understanding and appreciation of the computer science that they learn in their regular classes,\u201d he said.

He won the award for his paper on SPLs, \u201cFeature Models, Grammars, and Propositional Formulas,\u201d which was published in 2005. The paper explores ways to improve implementing feature models in product lines. According to his paper, a feature is an increment in program functionality which make up product-line members. A SPL is a set of these systems which allow more efficient changes and improvements to be made to software. Batory is a leading proponent of feature-based development of software, using features to improve software functionality in increments. Batory has been working with SPLs for over 25 years, and he has developed tools, languages and methodologies for practical, domain-specific SPLs. Some of his other research interests include model-driven engineering, domain-specific languages, and program refactorings, and he researches principles that both unify these areas and form a practical engineering basis for automated software development.

Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, January 4, 2016 By Nancy Doniger | EastonCourier.com Growing up in Easton, Zoe Wheeler and her siblings spent a lot of time doing puzzles, encouraged by their mother, children\u2019s author Elise Broach. \u201cMy family loves puzzles of all kinds,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey\u2019re in my blood. I grew up liking them and still do them with my mom when I go home. We do puzzles every morning.\u201d She became the The New York Times\u2019 youngest female crossword constructor at age 19. \u201cToday\u2019s puzzle is a debut,\u201d Jim Horne wrote in a blog about Wheeler\u2019s puzzle. \u201cThat\u2019s somewhat unusual. We average a few debuts a month. It\u2019s a debut by a teenager. That\u2019s rare. The teenage constructor is a young woman. That\u2019s unique.\u201d Read the blog atwordplay.blogs.nytimes.com . Last June, she received a surprise call from someone at Superhuman, a new program on Fox, set to premiere Jan. 4 from 8 to 10 p.m. Talent scouts had seen Wheeler\u2019s crosswords in The Times and reached out to see if she would like to compete on the new show. Although she hadn\u2019t originally answered the casting call, she completed the challenges to qualify for the show and flew to Los Angeles in June. She stayed for a week with two days of filming as one of 12 contestants, she said. They met actor Kal Penn, show host, and guest panelists including iconic boxer and entertainer Mike Tyson, actress/comedian Mary Lynn Rajskub and neurosurgeon Dr. Rahul Jandial. Penn and the panelists provided insights and comedic commentary about the competitors\u2019 unique abilities, while guiding the studio audience, who ultimately would decide which mental mastermind should take home the title of Superhuman and the grand prize. The show premiere will test the abilities of the 12 ordinary people to use their extraordinary skills and win the $100,000 prize. The other contestants are a mix of men and women, mostly in their 30s and 40s, one of whom is in high school, Wheeler said. They had to meet \u201ca huge range challenges that weren\u2019t all mental and were built around sight, smell, hearing and possessing amazing memories,\u201d she said. The audience could vote for just one person, and the results are secret. So people will have to tune in Jan. 4 to find out who won. \u201cIt was stressful at first when I got there,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to do well, but hanging out with the other contestants relaxed me. It was really interesting to see the inner workings of how TV shows are produced, and I would jump at the chance to do it again.\u201d Wheeler grew up in Easton with siblings Harry, 23, and Grace, 18, and graduated from Joel Barlow High School. Her dad, Ward Wheeler, is curator of the Museum of Natural History in New York. Now a graduate student in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, her goal is to become a software engineer. Life\u2019s a game, and she\u2019s having a ton of fun playing it.

Led by UTCS professors Simon Peter, Emmett Witchel, Vijay Chidambaram and Chris Rossbach, the consortium will bring companies that rely on computer science together with researchers on campus to help guide research at UT and introduce problems that need to be solved in the industry. So far, Microsoft, Google and telecommunications company Huawei have joined the consortium as industry sponsors. These types of partnerships not only allow academic researchers to work on interesting problems, but they give opportunities for industry to benefit from cutting-edge research and student talent. \u201cThe systems research consortium is a win-win,\u201d says Peter. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for industry because they will stay abreast of the latest research that we are doing, and at the same time we are staying up to date with the real problems that industry sees, which is important for us because it helps us steer our research a little bit.\u201d In software engineering, systems refers to the organization of operating systems, which support all the other software applications on a computer. Systems research focuses on developing ways to make software run more efficiently through the organization of these operating systems. This research can be used to improve applications such as data centers and communication networks. \u201cSystems is extremely relevant to industry from a very practical standpoint,\u201d says Rossbach. \u201cNo matter where you\u2019re operating in industry, if you\u2019re somebody who builds web applications or runs a service, you care about a whole bunch of things underneath that which are the subject of systems research. Research in that area will make it easier for you to build things that function in a reliable way and are efficient.\u201d Chidambaram says many common online services, such as Google and Facebook, have extremely sophisticated systems, and research is vital to improve these services. \u201cOur world is exploding with information,\u201d Chidambaram says. \u201cHandling this much data and making sense of it requires robust systems infrastructure with high performance.\u201d According to Peter, systems research is highly practical and has immediate relevance in the real world. The consortium will allow researchers to hear about problems and trends in industry and anticipate what systems will look like in the future, which is something that most companies do not have the luxury to do. A major area of systems research is improving the efficiency of data going into and out of servers. According to Peter, this issue is of interest to search engine companies such as Google, because if a search result takes more than a few tens of milliseconds to appear, the user will get bored and use another search engine. However, assembling these search results is very complex and involves contacting hundreds or thousands of servers in a data center. \u201cEach of these lookups that has to happen will contribute to the overall latency to serve you this page,\u201d explains Peter. \u201cThis means for each of these hundreds of backend servers, the times that they have to be able to react in has to be even smaller, on the order of microseconds. We\u2019re working on trying to cut down on these service times for these hundreds of backend servers \u2026 so that the web page can be presented to you, the end user, on the order of milliseconds.\u201d The \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the consortium is an annual workshop series hosted at UT, the Texas Systems Research Symposium, starting in the spring of 2018. The symposium will be an opportunity for industry partners to discuss technical challenges they encounter and for faculty and graduate students to present their research. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to us because it helps us to stay on top of the problems and trends that industry sees,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIt\u2019s also very important to industry because that\u2019s the main means of output that we have to tell industry what the latest research is and to have a discussion with them.\u201d In the consortium, industry partners can send engineers to the university to work together with researchers on-site. The program will also include opportunities for representatives of industry participants to give seminar lectures or guest lectures on campus and recruit students. While the consortium will mostly be for researchers and graduate students, undergraduate students will also benefit from interactions with companies through classroom interactions and events. \u201cWe invite an engineer to come and give a lecture in a classroom or to just come by and talk a little bit about what they\u2019re doing, which can help the students decide if this is an interesting company they\u2019d like to work for,\u201d says Peter. \u201cIt also gives them hands-on experience on how the systems concepts that we\u2019re teaching here are being used in practice in industry.\u201d One factor in the creation of the systems consortium was that UT Computer Science added three new systems faculty - Peter , Rossbach and Chidambaram - in 2016. Peter, whose PhD advisor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich had previously worked in industry and started a similar program there, says he realized the importance of collaboration with industry and knew he wanted to do something similar at UT. \u201cOur students do internships at these companies, they take the technology that we develop in the lab, they bring them into the company, they can potentially bring back interesting problems and new challenges,\u201d Witchel says. \u201cThat\u2019s where the magic happens in these relationships.\u201d",

    "text_content": "New Faculty Profile: Dana Moshkovitz | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Faculty Profile: Dana Moshkovitz Posted by Seshu Brahma on Thursday, March 16, 2017 Dana Moshkovitz earned her bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Israel while most people her age were filling out their college applications\u2014at the age of 17. She continued her education at Tel Aviv University, Weizmann Institute of Science, and Princeton, collecting computer science degrees at each and a postdoc at the latter. She has previously worked at MIT where she won a teaching award for her course on the design and analysis of algorithms. She has also published a rather popular paper on the Probabilistically-Checkable Proofs algorithm, which concludes an important result about randomized algorithms to verify proofs of certain problems. Here at UT, Dr. Moshkovitz is an associate professor in theoretical computer science, focusing on the more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and the theory of computation. Moshkovitz fell in love with this field at only 15 when she took a class on complexity and was hooked, fascinated at how tweaking a simple algorithm could create a problem that has yet to be solved for decades. \"It's mind-blowing that in mathematical theory, there is this well-lit side and a dark side\" that coexist when it comes to complexity theory. Set theory and induction also amazed her in college, and she really \"connected to the notion of proofs\" and how they could show \"the absolute truth of something.\" The field of theoretical computer science, however, is not an easy one. A major challenge theoretical computer scientists face every day is how they can think about a problem for years and years, can try all different ways to tackle a big problem, and still not get anywhere near a solution. But Moshkovitz says they're not all setbacks; sometimes the paths that don't work for one problem \"can be adapted to a different problem,\" which is a huge payoff in her line of work. When asked what a day in the life looks like for her, she laughs, saying, \u201cWhat I was doing when you came in here.\u201d (She was on a couch, surrounded by books and staring intently at another in her hand.) Currently, Moshkovitz is working hard on a problem that has been unsolvable since its inception in 2002, the Unique Games Conjecture. The conjecture postulates that the problem of determining the approximate value of a certain type of game, known as a unique game, has NP-hard algorithmic complexity. It has broad applications in the theory of hardness of approximation. Even though she is in the \"far end of the spectrum of theoretic computer science,\" Moshkovitz still thinks her work can be applied to and benefit society. She cites encryption, which makes all online commerce possible, as one such example on how theoretical work can in fact contribute to society. Moshkovitz is happy to be researching and teaching at UT, which has a \"magnificent track record in producing some of the stars of theoretical computer science\" and she wishes to do her part in contributing to that legacy.

Ritchie Doctoral Dissertation Award for his research in operating systems and file storage. The award is for a dissertation from the last two years that has had an impact in the field of software systems research. He won the award for his doctoral dissertation about decoupling ordering from durability in file systems from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2015. Up until recently, file systems could only be fast or reliable; either a file system could have high performance, or it could be reliable and accessible after power loss, but not both. Chidambaram\u2019s thesis research explored file systems that could both be reliable and provide high performance. \u201cStorage is one of the bedrock of applications everywhere,\u201d Chidambaram said. \u201cWhatever application you write, whether it\u2019s a mobile application, server application, desktop application, the games that you play or Netflix, everything depends on storage. Being able to store data in a safe, but at the same time highly efficient, manner is really critical to the systems we\u2019re building today.\u201d The Dennis M. Richie Doctoral Dissertation Award is given annually by SIGOPS , a special interest group by the Association for Computing Machinery focused on research and development of computing systems. The award was created by ACM SIGOPS in 2013 to \u201crecognize research in software systems and to encourage the creativity that Dennis Ritchie embodied, providing a reminder of Ritchie\u2019s legacy and what a difference one person can make in the field of software systems research,\u201d according to the award website .

Genter, who presented her Ph.D. dissertation on flocking behavior and other research in UT\u2019s Learning Agents Research Group to a panel of computer scientists this May, wanted to know if she could control the movement of virtual flocks by adding certain autonomous agents into the mix. In computer science, an agent is a computer program that acts on its own by following a series of pre-written rules. In this case, Genter developed \u201cflocking\u201d agents, which acted in the way a normal bird would, and \u201cinfluencing\u201d agents, which learned from the flock to push all the flocking agents in a certain direction. \u201cOnce you know who the neighbors of a bird are, (you can determine) what behaviors of the neighbors affect the behaviors of the agent,\u201d Genter said. \u201cThe model averages the orientation of the neighbors, and that determines the orientation of the individual agents.\u201d Genter said she doesn\u2019t control these agents: They must observe neighbors to make their own decisions through a type of artificial intelligence called ad hoc learning. \u201cYou\u2019re joining a team that you haven\u2019t pre-coordinated with and that you might not be able to communicate with, and you\u2019re still helping them accomplish the goal,\u201d Genter said. Through her thesis and a series of papers published through computer science journals and conferences, Genter tested how different combinations of neighbors and environmental factors affected the agents. \u201cIntuitively I thought that the birds that were closer to the agent would have a stronger impact,\u201d Genter said. \u201cBut \u2026 inherently there\u2019s no reason that closer agents should have more knowledge than further agents.\u201d Peter Stone, director of the research group and Genter\u2019s Ph.D. advisor, said researchers normally approach flocks by studying where they end up rather than how they can be pushed in one direction or another. \u201cEverybody up to this point had thought of flocking as something where all of the birds or fish are doing the same thing, rather than having this separation of flocking agents and influencing agents,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut we can insert some birds ourselves and influence what the rest of the flock is going to do.\u201d Genter said that these models have applications in real-life situations: Robot birds programmed with similar algorithms could infiltrate real flocks of birds and lead them away from dangerous areas such as airports and wind farms. \u201cIf you design a robot bird that has the same silhouette and the same wing-flap pattern, (birds will) actually think the robot bird is just another member of the flock,\u201d Genter said. \u201cOur method would \u2026 not scare the birds, not kill them, not take away their natural habitat, but just \u2026 lead the flock safely around the airport.\u201d Dutch company Clear Flight Solutions has already developed working robot falcons and eagles, with prototypes operating at the Edmonton International Airport, but Genter said that these robots must be controlled by a human operator and rely on scaring birds away rather than leading them in a specific direction. A representative from the city of Austin Aviation Department said in an email that the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport currently uses habitat management, spikes in roosting areas and propane cannons to keep birds away and scare them when necessary. \u201cBird challenges vary by time of year,\u201d they wrote. \u201c(The airport is) currently rated as moderate.\u201d According to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s wildlife strike database, the airport reported 35 strikes in 2016, with 289 strikes reported across Texas. Genter added that the models could also be applied to insects, fish and even herds of grazing animals. Stone said that artificial intelligence could lead flocks towards areas as well as away from them. \u201cThe airport is a representation of something that you want the flock to avoid, but in principle you could have them try to go somewhere, not avoid something,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou could have them try to go to wildlife preserves or avoid \u2026 areas where there\u2019s not a lot of food for them.\u201d Genter, who moved to Florida after her dissertation defense, said that although she plans to tour universities around the world as a guest lecturer, there are still many questions left open by her research. \u201c(Researchers) could actually be able to take flocking models that biologists are proposing, try them out in our simulators and see if the resulting behavior is the same as what they\u2019re experiencing in nature,\u201d Genter said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, there\u2019s something wrong with the model that they\u2019re using \u2014 if it is, it validates their model.\u201d News Categories Graduate Students Research Tags Katie Genter Learning Agents Research Group",

    "text_content": "An artificial intelligence learns to speak | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content An artificial intelligence learns to speak Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, October 7, 2015 Humanoids.io | July 29, 2015 The deep learning, a way of learning through experience for AI, seem to have a bright future. After enabling an AI to discover Mario or learn to read, this method is now used to teach a robot the language subtleties. A study, released this week at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, describes the experiment led by a research team from Austin University, Texas. This study, called \u201cLearning to Interpret Natural Language Commands through Human-Robot Dialog\u201d, was made to create dialogue agent that can be implemented in a robot to enable it to understand basic language. For the researchers, the latest approaches on the subject were not satisfactory, since they did not take into account some new language variations. So far, the most common approaches were based on keyword search to get the meaning of the sentence or the creation of an initial data base and the robot could learn the terms and make links between words. The dialogue agent designed for this study has an unprecedented system. Its learning method is based on three characteristics. First of all, the robot is capable of understand and identify terms thanks to semantic parsing, that is to say its ability to divide a sentence in syntactic categories. Besides, it can eliminate the ambiguities as regards some words thanks to its dialogue system. Finally, thanks to paraphrase, the robot can progressively learn human-robot interactions. The conversations were hold with the robot\u2019s web-based interface via the Mechanical Turk platform. The dialogue agent was also implemented on a mobile robot, which had to learn and understand delivery and navigation requests in a working environment. The mobile robot was an improved version of a segway, on which a laptop is installed and makes the Robot Operating System (ROS) work. The test was divided into three categories : navigation, delivery and validation. To make the robot navigate, it is necessary to ask it to go in a random room with the order : \u201c[Name] needs the robot. Send it to the office where he/she is working.\u201d The designations were chosen with complete names, first names, nicknames and titles. The delivery involved to send the robot to help a person with the order : \u201c[Name] needs the item [number]\u201d. The persons and items were selected randomly. This part consisted in asking a person to \u201cgive the first name and family name of the person in the office [number]\u201d. Incorrect answers were then annualized and validated or refused, no to take in to account spelling mistakes for example. The dialogue agent used the semantic parsing structure of Washington University. Lambda calculus formula were used to represent the words\u2019 meaning (lexical items). A system of combinatory categorial grammar to tag each word with a synthetic category including a template-based GENLEX, a generic lexical analyser based on existing models. It would enable the robot, once a question re-worded, to associate unknown terms with the ones it already knows. Therefore, if a person asked the robot \u201cdeliver item 5 to Pierre\u201d and then said it in other words because the robot said it did not understand, \u201cbring the item 5 to Pierre\u201d, the dialogue agent could relate deliver and bring to deduce the meaning of the order. Moreover, the dialogue agent could correct grammar mistakes in its interlocutor\u2019s sentences during the interactions with the people in charge of the test. The researchers are now considering to implement a speech recognition software to know if it can automatically correct consistent speech recognition errors.",

Bagels as they eagerly await the announcement of the secret theme at the third game jam hosted by Jolly, a local development studio. A game jam is an event during which participants must create a video game that satisfies a particular theme within a time limit. Student teams designed multiplayer video games over the course of the weekend to present at a showcase. Computer science senior Joshua Hurt, a member of Team Gimli, said he was excited for the weekend\u2019s theme of \u201cCouch Games\u201d \u2014 multiplayer games you play with your friends on the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hackathon that\u2019s totally restricted to games. I like to make games that make you hate your friends.\u201d The event took place in the Gates Dell Complex, where six teams of three to five members set up laptops and game controllers around tables, each table assigned the name of a Lord of The Rings character. The teams were organized by Jolly, who also provided meals and instruction throughout the event.  Jolly is an Austin game studio, comprised of notable members such as the team behind Words With Friends. Technical director Karl Gluck said the Jolly team would be circulating throughout the two-day event to help teams overcome problems. \u201cSomething different we\u2019re doing this time is we\u2019ll actually be helping them with their code,\u201d Gluck said. \u201cWe thought students could benefit more from direct interaction.\u201d Computer science junior Corbin Rogerson, a member of Team Aragorn, said even though participating in his first game jam was intimidating, the event doesn\u2019t require advanced experience, since teams match experienced participants with beginners. \u201cNobody cares if you make something terrible,\u201d Rogerson said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about getting the experience.\u201d Barely a day after receiving their instructions, teams showed off their games at a showcase Sunday afternoon. Games ranged from Team Aragorn\u2019s battle royale between dust bunnies and Roombas, to Team Gimli\u2019s John Cena arena, where players jousted each other on a 2-D battlefield. Vijay Thakkar, Jolly co-founder and chief technology officer, said game jams prepare students for the real world of game development. \u201cIt\u2019s always inspiring for us too, to be around students who have that raw passion to create and make something together,\u201d Thakkar said. \u201cWe want to cultivate it with students and hopefully bring them into the industry afterwards.\u201d News Categories Industry Relations Undergraduate Students Tags Game Jam Jolly Friends of Computer Science FoCS",

The department has won this accolade for its achievements in recruiting and retaining women into UTCS and for it\u2019s successful allocation of resources towards building a department-wide culture of support and community for women. UTCS has employed a constellation of recruitment and retention strategies that rely on goals shared by administrations, faculty, students, and staff. Organizations such as Women in Computer Science (WiCS) and Lean In, which are open to everyone but targeted towards women, provide a space for the department\u2019s women to connect with each other and form support systems. In fact, just last week WiCS hosted their 3rd, annual Week with Women (WWW). WWW is a week long series of company and social events that celebrate women in tech and specifically the one\u2019s in this department. Recruitment has also seen success through student-led initiates that involve various outreach activates such individually calling admitted high school women. Furthermore, every summer the department hosts First Bytes , a week long residential, summer camp for high school girls. The camp aims to intrigue young women with the potential of computing and the excitement of problem solving in hopes that they will pursue computer science in college. The initiative\u2019s success can be attributed to the fact that about 25% of the women in next year\u2019s incoming CS class are First Bytes alumni. There is no doubt that all of these efforts have been paying off; the numbers speak for themselves. The fraction of women in each year\u2019s incoming class has steadily increased from 13.58% in 2011 to 19.02% in 2015. In addition to being recognized, UTCS will receive up to $50,000, which the department plans on funneling back into more creative recruitment and retention efforts. The collaborative team that spearheaded the effort includes Ms. Tiffany Grady Buckley, Dr. Lori NcNabb, and Dr. Bruce Porter. Nevertheless, our department would not be what it is without all the amazing students, faculty, administration, and staff. News Categories Awards & Honors Outreach Tags First Bytes NCWIT",

    "text_content": "Inderjit Dhillon Awarded ACM Fellowship & Texas 10 Teaching Award | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Inderjit Dhillon Awarded ACM Fellowship & Texas 10 Teaching Award Posted by Chelsey Pena on Friday, May 1, 2015 Every year, the Texas Exes Alcalde asks UT alumni to vote on their favorite UT professors for a teaching award called the \"Texas 10.\" This year, UT Computer Science is proud to have our own Dr. Inderjit Dhillon represented among the winners. This prestigious award comes on the heels of Dhillon being named 2014 Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in recognition of outstanding research. The story below is a profile of a professor who has achieved remarkable success both in his research and in the classroom. Inderjit Dhilon started off his computer science career the way a lot of computer scientists do, with having a love for math. In his schooling at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay he continued to work with numbers and solving problems. This affinity would lead him towards the path of developing ground-breaking research in computer science. \u201cI always liked mathematics and I was never into computers before I went to school,\u201d Dhillon said. \u201cI started computer science there and in my final year I did a fellowship with a very famous mathematician. I never thought I would be a professor of computer science because I just wanted to do research.\u201d His research, and interest in the success of his students, is what makes him a great professor. After receiving his Ph.D in computer science from the University of California Berkeley he worked in several places that allowed his research to flourish. Dhillon\u2019s research focuses on data mining, machine learning, data analysis, linear algebra and optimization. His emphasis is on developing algorithms that analyze the problem structure and work with massive data sets. Some of his current research topics include high dimensional data analysis, social network analysis and predicting gene disease associations. A project that he is currently working on combines machine learning and applied mathematics, which is commonly called big data analytics. \u201cThrough this I try and look at data that comes up in different applications and develop new models,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe also worry about the computing the infrastructure we have and develop methods that help better use the computing structure. We design new machine learning algorithms that explore modern hardware.\u201d Dhillon\u2019s hardwork and research efforts do not go unnoticed. In fact he has won several awards and received great amounts of recognition.  Most recently he was named the 2014 Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for his contributions to large-scale data analysis, machine learning and computational mathematics. However he didn\u2019t find out about this until a month after he was notified. When you walk into Inderjit Dhillon\u2019s office on the fourth floor of the Gates Dell Complex his desk will immediately catch your eye. That\u2019s because it\u2019s completely covered in papers, letters, books and an array of other documents. It\u2019s a beautiful organized messed, where it seems like anything could get lost. \u201cI\u2019m terrible about checking my physical mail and when I do I just put it on my desk,\u201d Dhillon said. \u201cAfter exams had finished I sat down at my desk and start sifting through papers and I found a letter titled ACM. This was December 15 and the letter was dated November 1. I thought usually these things were sent through e-mails!\u201d ACM, the world\u2019s largest educational and scientific computing society, delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession. ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources. This fellowship comes after being awarded the IEEE and SIAM fellow. Dhillon is also featured in the Alcalde magazine in their Texas 10 piece . The Texas 10 is a highlight of ten professors that have been nominated by UT alum for being \u201cinspiring\u201d, \u201clife-changing\u201d, and \u201cmemorable\", to name a few adjectives the Alcalde\u2019s said were used in this year\u2019s nominations. In the Alcalde piece he talks about his days in college and how his research led him to work at places like AT&T Bell labs. A place he says where the names on the books he had studied and read were waiting in the same cafeteria line as he was. Dhillon also talks about in the feature how as a teacher he works to demystify math and put it in a larger context and explains how it has a more practical use. For example the usage of linear algebra in search engine searches. At the end of the day, Dhillon is glad that his path led him to teach and continue his research. Seeing students learn and grow is something that makes his job worth it every day. \u201cThe most fun for me is seeing the students when they come in and seeing how raw they are in their first years,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing the maturity over the years and then going out and seeing them being successful. Really that is what the best part of teaching is for me.\u201d News Categories Alumni Awards & Honors Faculty Press Release Research Undergraduate Students",

The soon to be graduates of the UT Computer Science department have left their mark on the school in many ways. And now, through a special program called Project Giving Tree, these students can continue to leave their mark for years and years to come. Project Giving Tree is a program developed by the UTCS department and run by a group of senior CS students with the goal of bringing the entire graduating class together. By creating a sense of community, the program hopes to strengthen the connection that these seniors feel towards the school and department. Along with building strong connections while on the forty acres, the campaign also strives to get these soon-to-be alumni to donate to create that same sense of community for students in the department for years to come. In it\u2019s second year of campaigning, the group plans to launch this week with their sights set high. Senior Sai Avala is a co-organizer along with Keerthana Kumar and six other CS seniors.  He says that having something like Project Giving Tree is essential for both past and present students. \u201cWe\u2019ve thrown events like trivia and pizza nights, have field days and do a final senior banquet to get people involved and one last chance for seniors to reflect on themselves,\u201d Avala said. \u201cThrough this we hope to increase alumni relations and increase awareness of how important it is to give back to the department through donations.\u201d Last year was the campaign\u2019s initial launch. Student organizers and Dr. Bruce Porter, chair of the UTCS department, sat down and decided that the money raised through Project Giving Tree should be spent in areas that will help undergrads. When you donate through Project Giving Tree your money will go towards projects like getting adjunct professors to teach new upper division specialty electives. Additionally, if you give a gift of $200 or more, your name will be etched in the GDC stairwell. The campaign committee hopes to gain momentum within these last few weeks of school with their events to get students excited and inspired to give back. The big event on their agenda is the senior banquet to be held on April 28. All UTCS seniors are invited to night of socializing, raffle prizes (maybe even an Xbox One), and tips on how to give back to the department. The committee hopes that through the events and tabling they do that they will be able to bring more awareness and shed light on a fundraiser that can benefit the department for many years to come. \u201cWe aren\u2019t necessarily trying to get students to give back right now. Now is great but that\u2019s not our main goal,\u201d Avala said. \u201cThrough this campaign we hope that we can create the community and inspire these students to give back throughout their lifetime. It may be now, it may be five years down the line or maybe longer but we want to get them to give back eventually.\u201d News Categories Outreach Undergraduate Students Tags Project Giving Tree",

    "text_content": "Dr. Dana Ballard Publishes New Book, Titled \"Brain Computation as Hierarchical Abstraction\" | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Dr. Dana Ballard Publishes New Book, Titled \"Brain Computation as Hierarchical Abstraction\" Posted by Brent Winkelman on Wednesday, March 11, 2015 UT Professor of Computer Science Dr. Dana Ballard recently published a new book, titled \"Brain Computation as Hierarchical Abstraction.\" Please see below for a complete overview. The following was originally published by MIT Press . Brain Computation as Hierarchical Abstraction By Dana H. Ballard Overview The vast differences between the brain\u2019s neural circuitry and a computer\u2019s silicon circuitry might suggest that they have nothing in common. In fact, as Dana Ballard argues in this book, computational tools are essential for understanding brain function. Ballard shows that the hierarchical organization of the brain has many parallels with the hierarchical organization of computing; as in silicon computing, the complexities of brain computation can be dramatically simplified when its computation is factored into different levels of abstraction. Drawing on several decades of progress in computational neuroscience, together with recent results in Bayesian and reinforcement learning methodologies, Ballard factors the brain\u2019s principal computational issues in terms of their natural place in an overall hierarchy. Each of these factors leads to a fresh perspective. A neural level focuses on the basic forebrain functions and shows how processing demands dictate the extensive use of timing-based circuitry and an overall organization of tabular memories. An embodiment level organization works in reverse, making extensive use of multiplexing and on-demand processing to achieve fast parallel computation. An awareness level focuses on the brain\u2019s representations of emotion, attention and consciousness, showing that they can operate with great economy in the context of the neural and embodiment substrates. About the Author Dana H. Ballard is Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, where he has appointments in Psychology, the Institute for Neuroscience, and the Center for Perceptual Systems. He is the author of An Introduction to Natural Computation (MIT Press). Endorsements \u201cLevels of abstraction is a key architectural approach in computer science. This approach to hierarchical systems is not sufficiently utilized in other fields. In this important volume Dana Ballard explores how computation in the human brain can be effectively modeled using levels of abstraction.\u201d \u2014 Joel Moses , Institute Professor and former Provost, MIT \u201cThis is a straightforward and highly readable formalization of brain function that has been needed for many years. The author synthesizes widely diverse material and concepts and presents a charming text derived from many years of intensive reflections and thoughtful dialogues.\u201d \u2014 Wolfram Schultz , University of Cambridge \u201cNeuroscientists see molecules, spikes, and synapses, yet fail to grasp the computing essence of neural processes; computational scientists are not yet fluent in the language of evolution to graduate from engineering to reverse engineering. Hopping on the giant shoulders of David Marr and Churchland & Sejnowski, Ballard finds a remarkable vantage point on brain computation.\u201d \u2014 Giorgio Ascoli , University Professor, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, George Mason University; author of Trees of the Brain, Roots of the Mind",

    "text_content": "University Students Interest in Mobile App Development Shows Continued Industry Growth | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content University Students Interest in Mobile App Development Shows Continued Industry Growth Posted by Chelsey Pena on Tuesday, February 17, 2015 Cellular devices are an agent for convenience for every day life. Mobile applications on these devices play a large part in this virtual accessibility. From having apps that allow you to make a payment transaction, to playing a quick game of Sudoku on a commute to work, to having all of your social media and news outlets in one setting. There\u2019s an app developed for something in almost every industry and no signs of this development slowing down. There are over two million apps in existence across a variety of different application outlets. To put the number in perspective, during the 2014 fiscal year Apple reported making $10 billion just on their iOS apps, which was more revenue than all Hollywood movies generated last year. This is because the demand from consumers to have a specific tool on a phone continues to grow. UT CS\u2019s student run Mobile App Development organization, most commonly known as MAD, caught on to this desire for people to both have apps but also to learn how to create them. \u201cIf you look at the industry there is huge demand for mobile applications that have a large user base because the company can use,\" MAD founder Sai Avala said. \"Students are going out and pursuing on their own because they have an idea. Applications are particularly relatable to people. Mobile phones took a fraction of the time to be popular and things are just speeding up. \u201c The organization founded by computer science seniors Niko Lazaris and Avala just a year ago has grown to be one of the largest organization in the UT CS school with a few hundred members. The group meets every day Monday through Friday, offers courses on iOS android, and web app development, hosts monthly hack nights and has a mobile app conference. The University of MAD, or uMAD, is a conference that MAD created to give students a chance to learn more about mobile app development through industry professional developers. Saturday February 21 marked the second annual event. Hundreds of students came out to the event, eager to learn more about the industry and hear from different company engineers. A few of the big name companies that made an appearance at this year's conference were BuzzFeed, HubSpot and RetailMeNot. \u201cWe started this and expanded it because it was a common interest between us,\" Lazaris said. \"It\u2019s picked up because mobile app developers are in demand now. We want to see our community be successful. We want to see them get jobs. The conference allows us to get as engaged as possible without power points, just hands on with the engineers.\" MAD isn\u2019t the only group catching on to the popularity of developing apps, UT\u2019s curriculum is as well. This semester\u2019s course schedule includes CS 371M Mobile Computing and CS 378 Mobiles News App Design, a crossover course with both journalism and computer science students. Professor Robert Quigley of UT\u2019s journalism school, teaches the crossover course. He says that offering this kind of a class to students allows them to collaborate and explore all aspects of the development process. \u201cTo develop a complete mobile app from scratch, students have to pull from nearly everything they know, and then some,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just coding - it is design, writing, critical thinking, teamwork and much more. I love the intersection of humanities and technology, and this class is designed to give the students experience in that space.\u201d In terms of the future of mobile apps, the industry does not show signs of slowing down production. \u201cApps are here to stay,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how they transition over to the wearable space. Will wearables just be notifications or are there bigger uses we haven\u2019t thought of yet?\u201d News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags Student Organization uMad",

    "text_content": "UT Hosts Conferences in Formal Verification and System Design | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Hosts Conferences in Formal Verification and System Design Posted by Rohan Ramchand on Monday, November 2, 2015 Three conferences and a workshop, all in the field of formal verification and system design, were held from the end of September through the beginning of October. The first, MEMOCODE \u201815, in its thirteenth year, is dedicated to bringing principles of formal methods to hardware development, which enables hardware designers to prove rigorously that their chips will function as intended. Indeed, as hardware has grown exponentially more complex, traditional methods of testing have become unreliable, and instead formal proofs of correctness are preferred. The second, SAT \u201815, is focused on the propositional satisfiability problem, which asks if a given logical statement, which is a mix of Boolean operators and variables, admits a set of assignments to those variables which make the logical statement true. SAT \u201815 also focuses on finding new applications of solutions to this problem. The third, FMCAD \u201815 (Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design), is dedicated to presenting novel approaches in the theory of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD focuses heavily on using formal methods to automate system design. In addition, the 13th annual workshop on the ACL2 theorem prover, a Lisp-based computer modeling software package, was held immediately after FMCAD \u201815. The ACL2 theorem prover was heavily developed by Dr. J Strother Moore, Professor Emeritus at UT Austin, and his work on the class of theorem provers of which ACL2 is a member (known as Boyer-Moore theorem provers), won him the prestigious ACM Software System Award in 2005. Dr. Warren Hunt, Jr., a professor of computer science at UT whose research focus includes writing formal specifications for computer hardware and proving their correctness, served on the steering committee of FMCAD and the program committee for the ACL2 workshop, and helped organize MEMOCODE and SAT as well. According to Dr. Hunt, the results presented at these conferences, which represent the cutting edge of research in their respective areas, are significant, but their utility may not be immediately apparent. Said Dr. Hunt, \u201cIt's often hard to say what is significant when it first appears. Why? Well, it's not yet [known] how much of an effect some newly-reported result will have until some time has passed.\u201d As is often the case with theoretical results, like the ones presented at these conferences, while their utility is not immediately known, they end up having a tremendous impact after further research. One famous example is PageRank, an algorithm that ranks results of a web search; this algorithm, created by Sergey Brin and Larry Page at Stanford, now powers Google\u2019s ranking engine. All three conferences will be held again in one year and the ACL2 workshop will be held again in 18 months. News Categories Events Faculty Tags Warren Hunt Newsletter-2015-Winter",

Gallaga Should we heed the warnings of movies such as \u2018Terminator Genisys\u2019 and the TV show \u2018Humans\u2019? Remember, in 1984, when a scary robot from the future told us he\u2019d be back? He IS back, fronting the lunkheaded summer blockbuster \u201cTerminator Genisys,\u201d in which former California Gov.

But this time, 30 years on, we\u2019re ready for him. The idea that robots will one day take over our jobs, our households, even our driving, no longer seems so sinister or remote. In fact, for many of us, it sounds great. Who wouldn\u2019t rather lean back and read an e-book than keep eyes on a congested Interstate 35? We\u2019re now cloud-dwelling information-agers. Why not let the higher machine power take over? Last week, when on the same day United Airlines, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Stock Exchange were stalled by computer glitches, one analyst from the research firm Gartner seemed ready to throw in the towel on human brainpower. \u201cOur best hope may be that computers eventually will become smart enough to maintain themselves,\u201d said Avivah Litan in an Associated Press story. +Ask any robot: Future of humans and AI will be complicated photo On the AMC TV show \u201cHumans,\u201d robots live among people in modern-day England as nannies, servants, elder caretakers and prostitutes.

In the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, robots are either stone-cold killers determined to wipe out humans or they\u2019ve been programmed to save us, mostly through blowing up other robots and trying to smile convincingly to assure us they are friendly. It never occurs to anyone in the \u201cTerminator\u201d films that a benevolent robot might be better at hacking the system by writing some decent pro-human computer code than toting shotguns and giant magnets in a futile fight against advanced robot models. If the robots in \u201cTerminator\u201d are big metal hunks of stock character, the artificially intelligent beings in \u201cEx-Machina\u201d are much more complex, though no less disturbing. +Ask any robot: Future of humans and AI will be complicated photo On the AMC TV show \u201cHumans,\u201d robots live among people in modern-day England as nannies, servants, elder caretakers and prostitutes.

Can they gain sentience? In other words, can we make robots that are more perfect humans? And why would they want us around if they existed? +Ask any robot: Future of humans and AI will be complicated photo Art Markman is a University of Texas at Austin psychology professor who edits the journal \u201cCognitive Science.\u201d He says our relationship ...

In one compelling scene, a stressed-out mom is told by her young daughter that she\u2019d rather hear a bedtime story from helper droid Anita than from Mom. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t rush,\u201d the little girl says. The mother is far from thrilled. \u201cHumans\u201d is like a less-depressing version of the British hit anthology series \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d which treats technology as an alluring trap that will always be subject to a nightmarish worst-case scenario. +Ask any robot: Future of humans and AI will be complicated photo Risto Miikkulainen is a professor of computer science and neuroscience at the University of Texas at Austin. He says the kill-all-humans ... Read More Art Markman, a University of Texas professor of psychology who edits the journal \u201cCognitive Science,\u201d says that over time, we\u2019ve gotten more used to the idea of yielding control to computer systems, but when it comes to the idea of robots made to resemble us, we are bothered by factors we might not even be aware of. For instance, the \u201cUncanny valley\u201d is the scientific theory that \u201cas things get more and more human-like, they get weirder for us until they\u2019re perfectly human,\u201d Markman said. \u201cWe\u2019re set up to make all kinds of exquisite predictions about human behavior. When you have something that\u2019s off, it\u2019s not just off \u2014 it\u2019s off-putting.\u201d Robots that don\u2019t age or die also remind us of our own mortality, Markman said. \u201cThe way we deal with this is clinging to the idea that though we ourselves may die, our culture may live on beyond us.\u201d If robots took over and didn\u2019t carry the same set of values, it\u2019s unlikely that the culture we treasure would be carried on in the same way. And lastly, we\u2019re pretty freaked out by \u201cthe Singularity\u201d (see this week\u2019s Digital Savant Micro), the concept that machines will eventually become self-aware, self-sustaining and evolved beyond our species. \u201cThe fear you see a lot in movies like the \u2018Terminator\u2019 films or \u2018The Matrix\u2019 is the point where the machines start programming themselves and undo whatever checks and balances put in by their human creators,\u201d Markman said. Would these future robots have much need for us? Would they value humanity the same way a human would? Why should they? In the new \u201cTerminator\u201d movie, humanity is doomed by the Skynet global network of the previous film, but it\u2019s now being Trojan-horsed into the world\u2019s systems as \u201cGenisys,\u201d a mass-marketed operating system that promises to unify everybody\u2019s smartphones, tablets and computers, something Apple has struggled with of late with its iCloud online service. In the near-future of \u201cGenisys,\u201d all the oblivious humans have their noses stuck in their phones and laptops and welcome Genisys as a life-changing, evolutionary computing step. Nobody in 2017, apparently, has learned the hard lesson that you should always wait a few days before a major software upgrade to try it out. See what happens, people? The Earth blows up and the robots take over. Likely scenario? Let\u2019s ask a computer scientist. Risto Miikkulainen specializes in neuroscience and \u201cbiologically-inspired computation.\u201d He says that while some advances, like self-driving cars, have happened faster than expected, that Hollywood scaremongering about robots is unrealistic. The kill-all-humans scenario, he says, is a \u201cvery, very unlikely course of events.\u201d \u201cSmart machines are always designed and built to serve humans, and to augment human abilities,\u201d Miikkulainen said. \u201cHumans will be augmented with machines, and perhaps merge with them, but a situation where humans would want to replace humans is not a logical future scenario. \u201cIn the very long-term future, it is of course possible that humans will become machines completely, but that will be a step in human evolution, on human terms, not an aggressive replacement of humans,\u201d he said. Feel better? Perhaps the biggest shift in pop culture\u2019s love affair with robots is that so little of it seems so far-fetched in an era when we can beam down maps practically anywhere on the planet and hear nearly every song ever recorded with the push of a few buttons. Artificial intelligence seems awfully real, and the fictional explorations of its morality and intent feels all the more compelling now. Says Markman, \u201cIn my own experience this week, I was driving down the street and saw one of those Google self-driving cars. And this is the week I got one of those Amazon Echos. You talk to it and it does things for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sort of feeling a \u2018future is now\u2019 moment.\u201d News Categories Faculty Research Tags Risto Miikkulainen Artificial Intelligence robot",

From cell phones, computers, and the internet, technology is a part of our every day life. It's a trend that is consistent throughout America and leading to a growing number of technology related jobs. From 2004 to 2014, the number of tech-related jobs grew 31% faster than jobs in other industries like business and healthcare.  In a wider scope, STEM jobs (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) grew 11.4 percent over the same period compared to the 4.5 percent growth of other jobs. While the U.S as a whole is experiencing major growth in this job category, it isn't wide spread. Specific areas of the country are dominating the job market when it comes to creating new tech jobs. Forbes magazine did a study on the percent of tech job growth in the last 10 year across 52 of the largest metropolitan cities in the country. According to the magazine, Austin, Texas takes the top spot in cities with the most technology-related careers.

    "text_content": "UTCS Students Win IBM Watson Competition | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UTCS Students Win IBM Watson Competition Posted by Brent Winkelman on Friday, January 16, 2015 AUSTIN, Texas \u2014  Computer science students from The University of Texas at Austin won $100,000 in seed funding for developing an idea for a smart phone app that would use artificial intelligence to help Texas residents get information about health care, food assistance and other social services in partnership with the United Way for Greater Austin\u2019s 2-1-1 Navigation Center. The Watson University Competition prize from IBM and The Entrepreneurs\u2019 Fund was awarded after students developed a prototype app, CallScout, that would use IBM\u2019s automated question-answering system Watson to streamline the delivery of information about social services available through 2-1-1. With the app in place, Central Texas residents, regardless of home Internet access, could find information about community services. For example, those seeking to know more about signing up for Medicaid or CHIP health care could get information on their mobile devices about hours of operation for sign-up, bus routes and necessary paperwork to bring to appointments. They could also receive notifications on their phones about relevant deadlines. The winning student team worked with Professor Bruce Porter , who was one of the computer scientists initially responsible for contributing expertise to the construction of Watson. Unlike search engines that yield an array of results from a keyword search, Watson works out specific answers to questions using complex artificial intelligence operations. In an upper-division class titled \"Automated Question Answering,\" Porter and colleagues at UT Austin and six other universities work with students to build applications that harness Watson to solve industry-specific challenges. \u201cOne of the things that set the UT team apart in competition is that they found and nurtured strong, viable partnerships with leaders in the social services field,\u201d said Porter, who is also chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201cIt was not just a class project. It broke out of the classroom. None of the other university teams in this competition had a partnership like that.\u201d Porter said the CallScout app will be available this spring for the general public to download through Apple\u2019s App Store. If the CallScout app is successful in Central Texas, it could also be rolled out by other 2-1-1 systems throughout the state. \"It was a privilege to partner with these intelligent and creative students,\u201d said Kay Garza, vice president of the United Way for Greater Austin\u2019s 2-1-1 Navigation Center. \u201cWe are excited to see this mobile app make a difference for residents of our local communities by bringing the convenience of 2-1-1 directly to their fingertips.\u201d News Categories Awards & Honors",

The movements of a maestro conducting his opus are similar to those of paintbrush strokes. In the case of Casey though, he substitutes thse art supplies for software and lets his programmed paintbrush create what he compare\u2019s to composer end results of an unexpected score. The Los Angeles based artist\u2019s work has recently found residence in the Gates Dell Complex. A Mathematical Theory of Communication is a two-part mural titled after Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver\u2019s book. \u201cI became fascinated with wall drawings but not with how they looked,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIt was less of how I felt but more of the system of drawing in itself. \u201c The mural was created by generating thousands of images with infinite variations to illustrate the idea that information is always circling all around. From radio, micro and satellite waves, the work captures and transforms it with an algorithm that produces the images. \u201cThe origin of the piece is based on television signals that are collaged in real time,\u201d explained Casey. \u201cCuts from the original camera are being cut in the software. This is my first time working with images in the mass media in a work.\" Over six million pixels and four million lines collectively make up the mural that took 143 days to complete. Despite the dedication and elaborate aspects of the project, Casey says that the process never ceases to fascinate him. \u201cIt\u2019s continuously challenging your perception and keeping your eye active. As a viewer you get to be put in an algorithm, and in doing that made the process of doing this a pleasure from start to finish.\u201d Casey currently resides and works in Los Angeles, California where he is an associate professor in the Department of Design Media Arts at the University of California, Los Angeles. His work has been featured in more than one hundred exhibitions and venues around the world.",

For new Assistant Professor Eric Price the interest in computer science dates back to his days of high school Olympiad. This math-based competition sparked the interest in computer science for the Virginia native and has taken him on the path that has led him to UT Computer Science. \u201cComputer science is a way you can do math and have it actually matter,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI have always liked to do math type stuff.\u201d Eric completed both his undergrad and, most recently in 2013, his Ph.D. in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was additionally a postdoctoral research fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing and the IBM Almaden Research Center. An affinity for math and the eagerness to learn has allowed Eric to excel in his research.  Fields that he has explored include sparse recovery, compressive sensing, and sparse Fourier sampling. His research focuses on Fast Fourier Transform and how to make it faster. Fast Fourier Transform is a Fast Fourier algorithm that reduces the number of computations needed to make the algorithm even faster.  Fourier transforms take a signal and expresses it in terms of the frequency waves that make up that signal. It is easiest to think about it in terms of sounds, like for instance playing a piano.  When a key is played you hear a sound but don\u2019t see the air moving back and forth. The goal is to find out how many samples are needed from the potential in the air to figure out how many frequencies are being played with each key. Eric\u2019s research has been featured in Technology Review\u2019s list of 10 breakthrough technologies of 2012. He has received the George M. Sprowls award for best doctoral thesis in computer science at MIT. His work expands beyond Fast Fourier. Eric is the co-creator of NewsDiffs, which tracks changes made on articles after they are published. NewsDiffs has been cited several times by the New York Times to reference old versions of its own articles. When Eric is not working on his research or teaching, he pays tribute to his roots by being an Olympiad coach. His interests range far outside of just the computer science spectrum though. This past summer he and a colleague rode their bikes over 800 miles from Spain to Germany. Eric also says he has recently been interested in puzzles after winning this year\u2019s MIT Mystery Hunt, an international renowned puzzle competition.  As the winner of the competition, Eric must now create the puzzles for the next mystery hunt this upcoming January. In the future Eric hopes to continue his research and teach algorithms. He feels that teaching is not only a way to share his research but also a way for him to continue to better learn it. \u201cIn teaching it you learn it better and more carefully,\u201d Eric said.  \u201cIt\u2019s more complimentary to the research. A student will ask a question and I will go \u201cOh I didn\u2019t think of that\u201d and it just gives me a new angle of the research to look into and think about.\u201d News Categories Faculty Tags Eric Price",

In the tech community, the live music capital of the world is home to one of the largest and oldest communities of artificial intelligence researchers in the world. That fact made it easy for the Association of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to select the city as its annual conference location. AAAI is an international non-profit society devoted to promoting research in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose of this conference is to showcase and encourage different AI research, and scientific exchange among AI researchers, practitioners, scientists, and engineers in various areas of disciplines. The conference held at the Hyatt Regency from January 25-30 featured various guest speakers, games, demonstrations and researchers that presented their work. Popular technology that gained interest was that of unmanned aircrafts, or drones, for their work in assisting public safety and search missions. Robotics also drew in interest with researchers participating in the \u201cRoboCup\u201d and letting their self operated robots play a game of soccer. University of Texas at Austin students programmed their robots to allow them to respond to specific situations on the field. The team, coached by UTCS professor Peter Stone, has recently won a previous RoboCup in Brazil just last year. The goal of the project is to create robots that are capable of playing against humans in the 2050 World Cup. UT has more than a dozen AI-related labs on its campus. This allows students, faculty and researchers the chance to explore various AI avenues. This made the city an appealing host for the conference. \u201cThis is a great way to be inspired and get up to speed on what artificial intelligence is really about,\u201d Stone said in an interview with Time Warner Cable News. The next AAAI conference will be held February 12, 2016 in Phoenix, Arizona. For more information on this year\u2019s conference and artificial intelligence, you can visit www.aaai.org .",

    "text_content": "UT Professor Explores Virtual Reality in Relation to Human Sight | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Professor Explores Virtual Reality in Relation to Human Sight Posted by Chelsey Pena on Thursday, October 30, 2014 Why do we look where we look? That is the question that UT Computer Science professor Dr. Dana Ballard is trying to answer. Through his research in virtual reality he has begun to solve this inquiry. Recently, UT Computer Science alumni filled the auditorium to hear Dr. Ballard\u2019s presentation of his research on virtual reality and it\u2019s effect on human vision and motor control. \u201cWe try to get answers on how brains are behaving in the world. To figure out these answers what we like to do is change things,\u201d Dr. Ballard said. \u201cWe have found that you have to change things rather quickly on a 100 millisecond time scale. In real reality that\u2019s hard but in virtual reality it\u2019s very easy.\u201d The human eye makes such rapid gaze changes that it achieves velocities up to 700 degrees per second between making 150,000 fixations per day. Dr. Ballard\u2019s research explores the idea that instead of the visual scene causing a shift in gaze, it is the brain\u2019s cognitive agenda. This result suggests that the location that the eye chooses to focus on is based on the value of furthering this agenda. Dr. Ballard began his presentation by illustrating how the visual scene causes a shift in gaze through the process of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As the knife moves from the jelly to spread on the bread, the focus of the eye is constantly shifting based on movement without much reliance from the brain. In the video below you can see that the round yellow cursor represents where the eye is currently focusing. When it moves across the screen, that indicates that the eye is shifting its gaze and focusing on another object. To illustrate shifts in sight based on a cognitive agenda, a  car is shown driving down the street on the GDC Auditorium projector screen. With every turn and motion of the vehicle the perception of view changes as the brain adjusts.  This explores the concept of the brain having a cognitive agenda in that it knows it must drive a vehicle and get to where it\u2019s going. Dr. Ballard's work has led to an increased understanding of the role of behavior in vision, and led to the extension of his research in regard to human\u2019s natural behavior in virtual reality environments.",

Instead he thinks of it as an individual\u2019s effort that can change a large part of science and how things are functioning for a lot of people. From Munich, Germany, Thomas came to the United States to attend Stanford University for college. Initially he went into his undergraduate career not knowing that his path would lead him towards computer science. \u201cIn the beginning I was interested in some sort of technology and business,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThrough this I became more drawn to the computer. I was very intrigued how stuff that could be done through computer science could really have an impact.\u201d After receiving his PhD in computer science at Stanford, he was a senior lecturer at University College London in the United Kingdom and an assistant professor at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. At UT Thomas teaches undergrad programming language and auto verification of software to those in the graduate program. He says that he enjoys teaching both levels of students. \u201cUT CS is a great department and I really enjoy working here,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cOf what I teach one is more hands on while the other is lecturing, which is transmitting information while being a stand up comedian. I am very pleasantly surprised by how engaged the students are.\u201d Thomas\u2019 research focuses on program verification and constraint solving. This includes automated ways to make programs more secure and run faster. Constraint Solving focuses on online constraint simplification and integer linear programming. When Thomas isn\u2019t teaching or working he enjoys traveling, scuba diving, hiking and being outdoors.  In his free time he also finds himself working on different home improvement projects. In the future Thomas hopes to continue his research and see the interest in computer science grow. \u201cA long term goal is to get us to the point where we can build software the way we can build a house, it\u2019s reliable and we know how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt is equally important to get students to be excited and push the field even more. I think it\u2019s about inspiring people to find their passion and finding something that is truly interesting.\u201d",

Opening Doors In FRI's Autonomous Robots research stream, Patricio \"Pato\" Lankenau built a \"telepresence\" system that let users anywhere drive a robot around one of UT Austin's buildings and see what it sees. His experience as a freshman and sophomore helped him land internships at Google and Apple. He's graduating next month after only three years in college. In the fall, he'll go back to work for Apple full time on a distributed computing project. He says the FRI was the conversation-starter that got him an in with companies he might want to work for one day.

Robert and Maggie have enhanced the course by working with MathWorks to enable participants to use Matlab freely during the course. The Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers , which offers a certificate of completion, was launched by edX, UT\u2019s non-profit partner which manages MOOCs in January of 2015. The course saw over 39,000 registrants in its inaugural year and, so far, over 6,000 students have signed up with over a month to go before the course begins. By linking the theory of linear algebra to issues that arise when implementing high-performance software libraries, the course content connects the mathematics to issues encountered in computer architecture, software engineering, and program correctness. The course builds on ongoing research by the instructors on how to develop and implement high-performance linear algebra libraries, funded by the National Science Foundation, so that the participant is simultaneously exposed to introductory material and the cutting edge of the field. http://youtu.be/c0fy5V7hA4g In reviewing this course, one student wrote: \"This course operates at three levels, I think. First, it helps you get some important principles around computational science and why efficient algorithms are fundamental to computation. Second, it gives you the rationale, foundations, and logic about the principles of matrix manipulation. And third, certainly not least, you get to learn the mathematics and specific practical skills to work with matrices and linear algebra.\" News Categories Faculty Tags Margaret Meyers Massively Open Online Course MOOC Robert van de Geijn",

The free weeklong camp showcases the potential of a career in technology to selected Texas high school girls. Campers attended presentations on subjects such as mobile app development, computer vision, game development, computer security, computational neuroscience, and gender roles. At Corporate Chat, professional women working in the field of computer science talked with girls over lunch about what it\u2019s like to have a fascinating, well-paying job, and provided career mentoring. VMWare hosted a coding challenge, and there were tours of the Visualization lab, and a Virtual Reality lab. The campers also had ample opportunity for hands-on learning. They participated in programming a game in Scratch and setting up and programming on a Raspberry Pi, and disassembled computers (Tool Time) . Campers went on a field trip to St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery to see how the robotic da Vinci Surgical System works and to learn about how data is managed in the healthcare industry; VMware to learn about cloud computing and participate in traversing a maze (blindfolded) by following simple instructions (as you would in a computer program); FreeScale to view the semiconductor fabrication rooms. This year\u2019s lab project used Arduino hardware, an open-source electronics prototyping platform, to control a strand of programmable color changing LED lights. Campers first complete a C++ tutorial and programmed in a language similar to C++ to blink the lights and control their color and brightness. By the end of the week, they progressed to creating complicated moving light patterns set to their team's song of choice. Campers enjoyed campus life and had a taste of what it\u2019s like to be a UTCS student. Associate Director of Academics Tiffany Grady talked to the girls about earning a degree in computer science, getting into UT, dual majors, scholarships, and career opportunities for UTCS graduates. They had a pool party at UT RecSports, went to Underground Bowling, shopped on the drag, went to a star viewing at RLM, practiced yoga, went running, and took a UT Tower Tour. There was even time for a Friday night celebration of the completion of Project Illuminate. Sponsors, including the CIA, Freescale Foundation, FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Texas Film Commission, Texas Workforce, Commission Summer Merit Program, and VMware, pay all expenses for camp attendees. First Bytes Camp would not be possible the without the contribution of individuals and companies that participate in the numerous presentations, labs, and workshops throughout the weeklong camp: Professor Dana Ballard, Marjorie Morales, Dr. Alison Norman, Scott Sutcliffe, Google, Lockheed Martin, St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery, Kristen Grauman, Mike Scott, Sarah Abraham (UTCS grad student), Jonathan Pillow (Computational Neuroscience).

AUSTIN, TX \u2014 A University of Texas at Austin program offering teachers certification to teach computer science has been fortified with a new $5 million grant from the Texas Education Agency, officials said. The university's WeTeach_CS program, a project of the College of Education\u2019s Center for STEM Education, secured the grant from the TEA, enabling it to increase its teacher education initiatives preparing Texas teachers to become certified in computer science. The program provides intensive and sustained K-12 professional development for Texas computer science teachers and already is responsible for a dramatic increase in the number of certified computer science teachers in Texas in tandem with the national CS for All initiative, university officials said. In 2015-16, the program trained 1,352 Texas educators and helped 177 teachers receive their CS certification, university officials added. The grant monies come at a critical time. Only 2 percent of Texas high school graduates completed a computer science class in 2015, even though 60 percent of today\u2019s science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs are in computing, according to the Texas Education Agency (TEA), officials noted. One of the main reasons for this shortcoming is that few Texas teachers are certified to teach computer science. The upshot: In 2014-15, pre-service teacher preparation programs produced only 14 computer science teachers in the entire state. \u201cTEA\u2019s previous support of WeTeach_CS has already been transformative for districts across the spectrum \u2014 from giant urban districts like Houston and Dallas to remote rural districts like Presidio and Iraan-Sheffield,\u201d said Carol Fletcher, director of WeTeach_CS. \u201cIn the Houston Independent School District, for example, the number of certified computer science teachers has grown from eight to 29 since 2015 as a result of the HISD-WeTeach_CS partnership. In 2015, the number of students in the district who were enrolled in advanced computer science courses was 151. In 2016, they had 1,042.\u201d About half of the grant will be used to fund 29 computer science collaborative efforts throughout the state to provide direct training and support for teachers in their region, according to university officials. The collaborative arrangements, which will be the largest state network of computer science teacher professional development in the country, are modeled on the Center for STEM Education\u2019s Texas Regional Collaboratives for Excellence in Science and Math Teaching, a statewide network of 57 pre-K-16 partnerships that provide professional development to pre-K-12 science and math teachers, university officials said. That program has developed the capacity of approximately 46,000 teachers of science and mathematics, according to school officials. The grant also will fund pilot teacher externship projects connecting Texas educators to industry experiences in STEM fields to deepen teacher knowledge about the trends, skills and opportunities in industries that will enrich instruction and bring relevance to student learning. \"TEA is thrilled to partner with UT on these initiatives,\u201d said Penny Schwinn, the TEA\u2019s deputy commissioner of academics. \u201cWe believe deeply in Texas educators and know that this investment in their collaboration with industry partners will not only enrich their ongoing professional learning, but significantly impact the achievement of their students.\" Manuel Justiz, dean of the College of Education, added: \"The Texas Education Agency\u2019s investment in WeTeach_CS ensures that Texas will lead the nation in K-12 computer science education. We are confident that the work we are doing will truly change lives.\u201d News Categories Outreach Tags WeTeach",

I\u2019d like to update you on these trends. As a reminder, during the years after the dot com bust, enrollments in computer science fell as low as about 700 undergraduates here at UT. We started this year with 2,100 students. Early estimates next year are starting to crystallize now, and we expect to pass the 2,300 marker, which brings us fully back to dot-com levels with no sign of a slow down in sight. Very recently, TechCrunch published an article reporting on NCWIT conducted research looking at computer science trends at a larger selection of universities, including UT Austin. The statistics are absolutely eye-popping. Stanford, MIT, the University of Washington, Michigan, and any number of others are seeing demand for their intro CS classes doubling and tripling. Students are continuing on to more advanced coursework at record levels, and there are early signs at some universities that the percentage of women in the field may be slowly starting to creep upward as well. If you\u2019d like view the complete article and accompanying slide deck, it\u2019s well worth your time. Perhaps most importantly, with computing now lying at the core of the world economy, all signs point to more permanent demand. These trends mark the beginning of enormous potential for our field and equally difficult challenges as we try to manage this explosive growth. While only time will tell how these patterns will play out, it is clear to us that as one of the leading institutions in the field, we carry significant responsibility as stewards of the field\u2019s next generation. As these patterns evolve, I will continue to keep you updated on these remarkably exciting shifts and what they mean for all of us who care deeply about the future computer science education at the University of Texas at Austin.

Each year, the cognitive and information sciences department of UC Merced invites one professional to the campus to be recognized for his or her work in field of cognitive science. This year, Ballard was selected for his contributions to artificial intelligence and computer vision, according to David Noelle, associate professor at the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts. Ballard is considered a pioneer in the investigation of biologically based approaches to computation, including neural networks, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms, Noelle said. After receiving his award, Ballard gave a presentation titled \u201cWhy Do We Look Where We Look?\u201d During his talk, Ballard, whose work focuses on computational theories of the brain with an emphasis on human vision, discussed his research on the eye\u2019s movement system. The system reaches velocities of about 700 degrees per second, he said, making about about 150,000 stable fixations per day. And every fixation, he explained, has a purpose directed by the brain. His research focused on finding out how the human brain determines what the eye will focus on. He explained how findings suggest that the gaze system does not choose locations based on the visual itself, but rather on their value in \u201cfurthering the brain\u2019s cognitive agenda.\u201d Ballard was part of a team that designed and built a high-speed binocular camera control system capable of simulating human eye movements. This system led to a better understanding of the role of behavior in human vision. Ballard said he plans to continue this research. \u201cThe mission (of this research) is to learn to take the direction of gaze very seriously,\u201d Ballard said. His studies of the human visual system have led to fundamental changes in how perceptual processes are conceived, according to his biography. Ballard is also known for developing innovative artificial intelligence methods for radiology and medical image processing, as well as co-writing a textbook on computer vision. Ballard spent 30 years at the University of Rochester before joining the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin in 2006. Sun-Star staff writer Ana B.

    "text_content": "UT Computer Science Unveils Cognitive Computing Course Based on IBM Watson in Fall 2014 | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Computer Science Unveils Cognitive Computing Course Based on IBM Watson in Fall 2014 Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, May 7, 2014 UT Computer Science is partnering with IBM to launch a new cognitive computing course that gives students unprecedented access to one of IBM\u2019s most prized innovations: Watson . UT-Austin is one of seven universities offering the new course this fall. Watson is a cognitive technology that interacts in natural language, processes vast and disparate forms of big data and learns from each interaction. Watson can sift through and understand massive amounts of big data at unprecedented speeds to assist professionals in understanding data quickly and easily, while increasing knowledge and value over time. Watson famously beat champion players on the TV show Jeopardy! in 2011. The upper-division course, co-designed by Bruce Porter , professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science, along with other leading academic experts and IBM\u2019s Watson Group, will empower students with the technical knowledge and hands-on learning required to develop new cognitive computing applications fueled by Watson\u2019s intelligence. Students will form business teams and have access to their own Watson instance via the Watson Developer Cloud. As a class, they will select an industry to focus on, such as retail, travel or healthcare, and then will work as a team to import relevant data into Watson and train it. Ultimately, the students will break into teams and develop prototype apps and a business plan based on their Watson industry of choice. For example, in the retail domain questions can focus on: \"How can Watson be applied to personalize the consumer shopping experience?\u201d In the travel industry: \"What changes would be applied to help consumers target their next vacation based on their experiences and interests?\u201d As result, each student will gain the perspective and vision of a technology entrepreneur who can transform industries and professions with cloud-delivered expert advisors that think, learn and discover valuable insights from massive amounts of data. This class contributes to an important strategic goal of the Department of Computer Science, according to Professor Porter, \"Watson demonstrates the power of machine learning and data analytics. These are increasingly important technologies that are transforming entire industries and creating new ones. They are important to every top computer science program.\" Over two decades of research, Porter and his team have developed core technologies for automated question answering that have been incorporated into Watson. Four members of the team currently work on the Watson project at IBM. According to research firm Gartner, Inc., smart machines will be the most disruptive change ever brought about by information technology, and can make people more effective, empowering them to do \"the impossible.\" Building on the 4.4 million IT jobs Gartner predicts will be created to support Big Data by 2015, the following universities will educate a new generation of innovators who can bring to life this new dynamic of people and machines working together to solve pressing industry and societal challenges.

    "text_content": "UT Launches New Mobile Certificate Program | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Launches New Mobile Certificate Program Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, April 28, 2014 It\u2019s common to check Instagram, what the weather will be like, and fight personal battles against starting another game of 2048 before even getting out of bed these days. Mobile computing is completely changing everyone\u2019s lives, and yet the people capable of making these changes are extremely uncommon. Responding to industry needs, UT-Austin has created the Mobile Computing Certificate. The certificate is part of the Game And Mobile Media Applications (GAMMA) Program \u2014an interdisciplinary undergraduate program jointly developed by the Computer Science department, College of Fine Arts , and Radio-Television-Film department. To earn the certificate, students must complete five classes , including Introduction to Wireless Networks , Computer Networks , two upper division electives related to mobile computing and a mobile platform requirement. Starting next spring, students will be able to fulfill the mobile platform requirement with either iOS or Android. While mobile computing classes have been offered at UT before, Dr. Paul Toprac notes that the certificate will show that students \u201chave collected a series of courses that sum up to something beyond just taking a bunch of random courses.\u201d Toprac recognized the need to train students to participate in the rapidly growing mobile industry when he first started at UT two years ago. He explains that those who complete this certificate will become more specialized, able to fulfill the need for entry-level mobile jobs in industry. \"Our re-designed curriculum allows students to focus on one or two areas of computer science, including mobile, gaming, security and big data. There is a growing demand for students to specialize in a certain area, so we are giving students the tools to be successful in the ever-changing world of technology,\" says Tiffany Grady, Associate Director of Academics for UT Computer Science. This program has received a lot of support and encouragement from companies interested in hiring mobile computing graduates in the future. One in particular is called Mutual Mobile here in Austin, which was started by UTCS students who took Autonomous Multiagent Systems , and realized that concepts from the class also had mobile applications. Companies that aren\u2019t entirely focused on mobile computing, such as RetailMeNot , are also interested in hiring graduates of the program and see the value of growing their mobile operations in the future. Dr. Bruce Porter, the chairman of UT Computer Science, also highly supports the certificate program. Last summer, he started talking to faculty members about the importance of opportunities to bring mobile computing to students, which Toprac claims is \u201canother indication that they\u2019re trying to respond to industry needs, particularly ones that fit very well with UT and Austin. Austin is very big in game development and mobile computing.\u201d Toprac says that the typical student that he expects to complete the certificate will be more interested in front end work, and that they will be working on teams with people like customers, artists and designers to create their apps. He explains, \u201cthey have to understand interface design and interaction design\u2026 that being said there are people who love doing back end stuff who take these courses and learn how to do the front end stuff\u201d as well. One of the things Toprac says he\u2019s most excited for is that \u201cwe\u2019re going to see an explosion of apps being created by students.\u201d There really isn\u2019t a better place and time for this program to exist than here in Austin.

Cook was awarded the Senior Prize for his contributions to the theory and practice of object-oriented programming. Cook currently teaches Programming Languages and his research focuses on improving the ability of programming languages to facilitate the development of efficient and maintainable software. The AITO Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard prize, established in 2005, is awarded to two individuals each year who have made significant technical contributions to the field of object-orientation. Work selected for the prize must be in the spirit of the pioneer conceptual and/or implementation work of Dahl and Nygaard, which shaped our present view of programming and modeling, now known as object-orientation. The AITO Dahl-Nygaard Prizes are named for Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, two pioneers in the area of programming and simulation. Their foundational work on object-oriented programming, made concrete in the Simula language, is one of the most important inventions in software engineering. Their key ideas were expressed already around 1965, but took over 20 years to be absorbed and appreciated by the broader software community. After that, object-orientation has profoundly transformed the landscape of software design and development techniques. It was a great loss to our community that both Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard passed away in 2002. In remembrance of their scholarship and enthusiastic encouragement of young researchers, in 2004 AITO established a prize to be awarded annually to a senior researcher with outstanding career contributions and a younger researcher who has demonstrated great potential for following in the footsteps of these two pioneers. AITO (Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets) is a non-profit association registered in Kaiserslautern, Germany. The purpose of the Association is to promote the advancement of research in object-oriented technology, primarily in Europe, in particular through the organization of the annual European Conference for Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP). In addition, AITO Co-Sponsors Agile Development, The Conference and backed 1st International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development . AITO (Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of object technology. As of March 2014, it has 41 members and is registered in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Current President of AITO is Professor Eric Jul. For further information, visit www.aito.org .

    "text_content": "Meet Two Robot-Programming Sophomores | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Meet Two Robot-Programming Sophomores Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, May 2, 2014 Two computer science sophomores are using the skills they gained in the Freshman Research Initiative to program flying robots and show them off to other students on campus. Robert Lynch and Matt Broussard, who were both involved in the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics FRI stream run by Dr. Peter Stone, had different ways of arriving in computer science but say research has enriched their undergraduate experience more than anything else. The stream's ultimate goal is something called the building-wide intelligence project, which will fully integrate the Gates Dell Complex with robotic intelligence, designed in part by Lynch and Broussard, to aid people around the building. The pair now demo their quadcopters from 12:30-1:30 p.m. every Monday in the GDC atrium. They allow students to try a device that lets them steer the copter just by adjusting the angle of their hand over a sensor pad. I sat down with the pair to see how they got started in computer science and what the FRI and research mean to them. Check out the video! Kaine Korzekwa: So how did you get started in computer science? Matt Broussard : I had been pretty involved in computer science before college, actually programming since sixth or seventh grade. My dad works at IBM and I've just always been around it and he got me a book about programming and said 'Hey I think you'd be interested in this.' At first I didn't think I would be but I started realizing how fun it can be. To some degree it's like you're typing magical incantations into the computer and then things happen \u2014 that's a very broad abstraction though. Robert Lynch : I got started a little differently than Matt. I had no computer science background coming to the university. To be completely honest, I flipped a coin my senior year of high school to decide on a major. It was between this and engineering. I knew I liked computers but did not know if I liked the engineering side or the programming side. And how did you get involved in this research on robots? Lynch : Coming in we were both presented with the opportunity to join the Freshman Research Initiative, which is a program here in the College of Natural Sciences where freshmen first learn certain research methods and how to use research journals and think scientifically and then you actually go on board in different research streams. We were sorted into this stream, Autonomous Intelligent Robotics. Broussard : We all have different projects we work on. In our first semester Robert did a lot with wi-fi localization and I did a lot of work on touch screen programming. It's pretty cool because the research has to do with this building itself. Later we both got interested in the control of aerial vehicles and got involved in this quadcopter and drone work. Do you like doing the demos? Lynch : The absolute coolest thing to experience in this field is when something works. I just throw my hands in the air and shout 'YEAAASSSS!!!' To see something you made from nothing make people's lives easier or more fun is very rewarding. At the demos more technical people ask how it works or how to get involved, but most say '*expletive* that's cool!' They think it's awesome and then you ask if they want to try it and their eyes light up. Do you think the Freshman Research Initiative was a good experience? Broussard : FRI puts you in an environment with people the same as you. The point is that you're just going to dive into something that's probably much larger than you. We're talking about computer vision, computer navigation and robot assembly that I don't think we necessarily would have been exposed to if we hadn't been in the stream. Lynch : Well we were in here as freshman and that was actually the coolest. You could just walk up to the lab and just touch your card on the card scanner and you felt like a secret agent, to let the kid in me out. I believe everyone should try research because you don't know if you like it or not until you try it. Why do you think computer science is so important right now? Broussard : After you get to know the field and mature a bit you start thinking about how computer science is applicable to many career fields. In comparison to other majors I think it has the most potential to do good in any number of different domains just because it's so flexible and so applicable and everything in the world runs on software: organizations, governments, even this university, all run on some kind of software system.

    "text_content": "UTCS Students Launch Project Giving Tree | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UTCS Students Launch Project Giving Tree Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, April 9, 2014 On April 4, the UTCS student body launched the first student-driven giving campaign in the Department of Computer Science. This campaign, called Project Giving Tree, is dedicated to improving the overall quality of UT Computer Science undergraduate education. The campaign will culminate in a fundraiser for graduating UTCS seniors on April 23. Project Giving Tree is a response to the changing dynamics of University funding. With state funding at all-time lows and tuition at all-time highs, the campaign seeks to raise awareness about the importance of giving back to UTCS starting as soon as students graduate. State funding for UT Austin has been declining for years, and today, the overall percentage that the state contributes to the University budget has fallen to 13%. Thirty years ago that number was nearly 50%. The slow and inexorable decline of state funds has forced public schools to follow in the path of their private counterparts to ramp up funding from alumni to fill the shortfall. Some universities do this better than others. Nationally, the average university has an alumni giving rate of 8.7% annual participation. Some institutions are fare more effective, with Princeton at the head of the pack with an alumni giving rate of 62.5%. Historically, UTCS alumni have not been asked to contribute significantly to the department's future, and in 2012 the annual giving rate was a mere 0.5%. The students with Project Giving Tree aim to change that momentum. One of the many challenges the campaign faced is a series of building project on campus, including the newly completed Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex. These new facilities can create the impression that underlying academic budgets are sound. A portion of the campaign is focused on educating students about how construction projects heavily funded by foundation and private gifts use funds that aren't eligible for core academic and teaching purposes. This year's Project Giving Tree committee is led by student co-chairs William Combs ad Elynn Lee. The two students sat down with Dr. Bruce Porter prior to the launch of the campaign to discuss how the money raised by Project Giving Tree would be spent. They decided that in an effort to directly support the area that impacts undergraduates the most, the money would be used to fund special classes the department couldn't otherwise offer. These will be specialty classes with wide appeal chosen by the chair in consultation with the student body. In speaking of their motivation for taking on the project, co-chair William Combs said, \"In the end, we won't be able to experience the benefits of this project firsthand. What we can do is make sure that the school we're leaving behind us is better for the next generation of UTCS students, and that the legacy of a UTCS degree remains strong.\"",

It will be funded through a $5 million allocation approved last year by the Texas Legislature the largest state level investment in identity theft protection in the country. The new resource center will provide research, educational materials, workshops and outreach to the public, with an initial emphasis on materials for the groups most at risk for identity theft: seniors, children and small businesses. It will provide clear and accessible resources to empower citizens\u2014both online and offline\u2014to be better informed and make smarter choices to protect their personal information. \u201cIdentity fraud is an increasingly common occurrence and a huge expense for state and federal government,\u201d said Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, who serves on the Center for Identity\u2019s Board of Advisors and chairs its Child ID Task Force. \u201cSmarter, more informed consumers lead to less fraud, theft, and abuse of identity information. We believe this effort can help prevent millions lost to the state of Texas as a result of identity fraud cases.\u201d \u201cThe Texas Legislature has given us the opportunity to grow the Center for Identity into an international center of excellence and an unparalleled resource for Texans and beyond,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Barber, director for the Center for Identity. \u201cWe will equip individuals with the knowledge and tools needed to manage, protect and value their identity in today\u2019s ever-connected world.\u201d The new resource center is expected to launch in the summer of 2014. It was announced this week at the Center for Identity\u2019s third annual ID360 conference at The University of Texas at Austin. ID360 brings together thought leaders from every angle of identity management including researchers, industry leaders, policy makers and technologies to discuss trends, concerns and solutions related to identity management. The Center for Identity brings together researchers and scholars from across UT Austin\u2019s top-ranked schools and programs in Business, Communications, Law, Public Affairs, Engineering and Computer Science to focus on issues related to identity management, privacy and security. Leveraging the resources of The University of Texas and those of its public and private sector members, the Center forecasts threats and delivers solutions that define and protect identity in physical and cyber environments.

    "text_content": "Alumni Profile: Hideko Kunii Paves the Way for Women in Tech Industry | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Alumni Profile: Hideko Kunii Paves the Way for Women in Tech Industry Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, July 29, 2014 College of Natural Sciences alumna, Hideko Kunii (Ph.D. \u201983) is a trailblazer in a culture that has a history of discouraging women from advancing in the workforce, most notably in the technology industries. Despite these hurdles, Kunii has had an illustrious career and is one of very few women to be promoted to the top levels of the tech industry in Japan.  For over twenty years she worked in upper management at the Ricoh Company, Ltd. and is the only woman to have risen to the rank of corporate vice president. Kunii attributes much of her success and skill to the time she spent at the College of Natural Sciences. Kunii came to The University of Texas in the late seventies on her own, although one summer her husband, Tosi Kunii, joined her as a visiting professor in the Department of Computer Science . Hideko Kunii had master\u2019s degrees in physics from Ochanomizu University in Japan and computer and information sciences from San Jose State University. She originally considered studying for her Ph.D. degree in Japan but was so impressed by the practical applications of computer research at The University of Texas at the time that she decided to come to Austin. Kunii pursued a Ph.D. in graph databases under the guidance of her advisor and now good friend, James C. Browne (Professor Emeritus, Department of Computer Science). In a graph database, each bit of data includes information about how it relates to other bits of data. The most well known example is Facebook, where that photo of you at Disneyland also contains information about who else has seen the photo and liked it or shared it. Kunii's research explored how databases could be represented visually using a Graph Data Model (GDM). According to her dissertation, \u201cThe capabilities of the GDM include direct representation of many-to-many relationships and of the relationships within a single record type.\u201d \u201cShe was a person of determination, as well as talent and class. She finished an excellent Ph.D. in graph databases, which at the time was extremely pioneering. When you think of Facebook and things like that, the underlying technology is a graph database. Her work was too pioneering to get the recognition it deserves today,\u201d remarks Dr. Browne. After graduating from the College of Natural Sciences in the early eighties, Kunii returned to Japan, armed with newfound confidence and superior computer software skills and joined the Ricoh Company, Ltd. as a manager. At the time, Ricoh was in need of employees with software experience but they couldn\u2019t find a man with her level of proficiency. Recalls Kunii, \u201cThe attitude toward women was getting better in Japan\u2026 but once you join companies, the promotion is quite slow for women. I was introduced as a man when I joined Ricoh. It meant I was treated as a professional.\u201d According to Kunii, she did not set out on a mission to change the cultural norms for professional women in Japan but she now acknowledges that since graduating with her Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from The University of Texas at Austin, this has become a very important part of her personal mission. \u201cWhen I went back [to Japan] in 1982 I had two missions. One was to push the issue of women\u2019s empowerment in society and industry. The other is software,\u201d reflects Kunii. Over the years Kunii has continued to break down gender barriers and pave the way for Japanese women in the technology industry. Last month the Honda Motor Company appointed Kunii as the first female board member in the history of the company , marking a turning point in Japan\u2019s biases towards women in the technology industry. She currently serves as general manager of the Gender Equality Promotion Office of the Shibaura Institute of Technology and won the 2006 IEEE Tokyo Section Women Pioneer Award. She has also been nominated to the Tokyo Electric Power Company Board, which has been tasked by the Prime Minister to carry out a compensation plan for Fukushima losses as well as decontaminate the site, and provide a stable electric supply. Dr. Browne sums up the life and attitude of his friend and former student best, \u201cThere are people that want to use their positions for self aggrandizement\u2026 and then there are people who want to use their position to make the world a better place and I think she is one of those people.\u201d News Categories Alumni Tags Hideko Kunii Computer Science",

    "text_content": "UT Austin-AISD Partnership to Support Computer Science Education | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Austin-AISD Partnership to Support Computer Science Education Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, April 4, 2014 UTEXAS.EDU The University of Texas at Austin and the Austin Independent School District (AISD) are partnering to offer college credit to computer science students in AISD high schools. The partnership will prepare five AISD teachers to deliver \u201cThriving in Our Digital World,\u201d a computer science principles course aligned with the Texas College and Career Readiness Standards. The course was developed by the UT Austin Computer Science Department\u2019s Project Engage through support from the National Science Foundation and UT Austin\u2019s new dual-credit initiative, OnRamps . AISD and UT Austin will offer the yearlong curriculum to high school students with an option to be dual enrolled in a UT Austin undergraduate course through the University Extension. To help increase the number of teachers prepared to deliver such innovative computer science education, Google will fund a cohort of AISD teachers to participate in OnRamps and Project Engage\u2019s Professional Development Summer Institute. \u201cPart of the mission of OnRamps is to develop a cadre of teachers in the state of Texas who are facilitating dual-credit at the level of rigor required for students to excel in subsequent college coursework,\u201d says Dr. Julie Schell, director of OnRamps and Strategic Initiatives in the Center for Teaching and Learning at UT Austin. \u201cWe are excited by early reports that the Project Engage curriculum is helping high school students see the beauty of computer science in their pre-college years. We could not be more thrilled that Google is interested in helping us reach our ambitious goals right here in Austin.\u201d \u201cThriving in Our Digital World\u201d exposes students to the big ideas in computer science that exist across disciplinary boundaries. High school students who maintain a grade of 75 percent or above in the first semester of the high school course are eligible to earn college credit during the second semester for CS 302\u2014Computer Fluency, an introductory course to computer science for nonmajors at UT Austin. CS 302 covers the fundamental concepts of computing: how computers work, what they can do and how they can be used effectively. Students who successfully complete the course will receive a UT Austin transcript. \u201cUT Austin is enthusiastic about partnering with Austin ISD, Google and other school districts, community colleges, universities and additional partners across the state to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities that are engaging for students and their teachers and directly aligned with what students need to be competitive in other college-level courses,\u201d says Dr. Harrison Keller, vice provost for higher education policy and executive director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at UT Austin. Dr. Paul Cruz, AISD\u2019s chief schools officer, says he appreciates the opportunity to expand the district\u2019s offerings for students to earn college credit in high school. Throughout the course, diverse student populations engage with computer science through a series of projects, working with content that is both rigorous and relevant to their lives. \"We are proud to be supporting innovative partnerships like the one being announced today by The University of Texas at Austin and the Austin Independent School District,\u201d says Gerardo Interiano, Google\u2019s public affairs and government relations manager. \u201cIt is through these relationships that we can further expose children from diverse backgrounds to computer science. Through this initiative, our community can ensure that this next generation is ready to meet the demands of our high-tech employers.\" Dr. Calvin Lin, a UT Austin computer science professor and developer of the OnRamps course, adds, \u201cThe lack of computer science courses in high schools is a serious problem, so we're excited to address this issue. We're going to need to do much more, but this is a great start.\u201d This partnership between UT Austin and AISD is representative of OnRamps\u2019 broader mission to collaborate with innovative educators to increase the number and diversity of students who experience rigorous, high-quality dual-credit coursework that develops deep conceptual knowledge and academic skills aligned with the expectations of leading research universities. The initiative offers three additional dual-credit courses, including English, pre-calculus, and statistics, also to be implemented in AISD schools during the 2014-2015 school year.

This is the third year for the KPCB Engineering Fellows program with almost 2500 applicants from over 200 universities. Throught the KPCB Fellows Program, Wesley will have an opportunity to gain significant experience working on uniquely challenging technical, design and product problems while also developing new relationships that are meaningful to his career. He will also attend private events hosted by portfolio companies where he can meet talented engineering and design icons from across Silicon Valley. Wesley will be working with MyFitnessPal this summer. When asked about his experience with the selection process, Wesley took us back to October 2013 when he had just met the MyFitnessPal team. Vijay, their VP of engineering, saw a post that Wesley made on Hacker News about his Ph.D. research, which looks at the effects of diet on chronic illness. Vijay thought there could be an opportunity there to collaborate. Since then, the MyFitnessPal team has grown at a rapid pace\u2014from around 20 people in October to over 60 at the moment. Wesley spent this spring break in San Francisco working out of their offices to do some initial data preparation for the summer. Specifically, Wesley will be working on modeling users and making recommendations. The goal is to understand which diets people are following, how those diets change over time, which diets work and which lead to people quitting, and how MyFitnessPal can make suggestions to people to help them reach their weight loss goals. These are challenging problems and will require a lot of cutting-edge machine learning techniques. With over 50 million users, the potential for impact is huge. MyFitnessPal could potentially help people to lose just 1 more pound on average. It's also the first time the team will have a chance to really understand dieting with a large population of users. Most nutritional studies are either a small sample size (e.g. 10 people who each log their exact diets every day) or use simplified surveys (e.g. a questionnaire sent to 60,000 people will ask how much fish people eat on average every day). At MyFitnessPal, the team can actually look and see\u2014at a fine grained level\u2014what MILLIONS of people are eating every single day. It's an awesome opportunity to discover new scientific knowledge by leveraging this huge dataset that was only made feasible in the last couple of years.

However, students voluntarily taking classes on a Friday night seemed dubious to some. \u201cI thought it was a very ambitious and enterprising idea, but I also had this sinking feeling that it would probably attract 25 students,\u201d Professor and Chairman of the Department of Computer Science, Bruce Porter said, \u201cI was absolutely blown away by the success of it.\u201d Success was not only measured in the number of students that attended. \u201cWhen the students were walking around the atrium they were having really casual, normal conversations with the engineers, like they were talking to friends,\u201d Avala said. \u201cAt a hackathon or a career fair you go to the companies and you pitch yourself to them because you want to impress them as much as possible, but at a conference everybody is there doing something they like. Some students actually got jobs on the spot. The interview was just being with the engineer.\u201d Although some looked for jobs, most students were focused on learning. \u201cThis may be what higher education should look like,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIncreasingly in the future students will be more responsible for their own education, and that\u2019s what this showed me. A student run event on a topic that the students all passionately care about; that sparks the engagement of the students much more than I can do in the classroom, or that my faculty can do. I\u2019ve not seen anything like this. 400 students sign up for this event? On a snow day?\u201d The students weren\u2019t the only ones learning that evening. \u201c[uMAD] taught me that there is a way to higher education that doesn\u2019t depend on old people talking about things they think the students should care about. There\u2019s an alternative to that,\u201d Porter said. \u201cPick a topic that\u2019s timely, that people care about, get the old people out of the picture, and let the students train themselves, teach themselves on this topic.\u201d With over a quarter of the CS undergraduate class signed up and over 300 students attending, the MAD officers can\u2019t help but be excited for what they accomplished this year. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much why we had uMAD,\u201d Avala said. \u201cJust bringing all the students throughout the community together and giving them the opportunity to learn. And next year will be even bigger.\u201d News Categories Events Industry Relations Undergraduate Students Tags Comyar Zaheri Daniel Monroy Eddie Saenz MAD Mobile App Development Niko Lazaris Sai Avala Student Organization uMad",

This marked the third time the university was a part of the event. Facebook Open Academy started in spring 2013 with the goal of improving the curriculum at various top university computer science departments all over the world. The event is a day three day kick off at the Facebook headquarters. The real work comes when the students return home and work on their projects remotely. Through this program, students are not only allowed to receive academic credit for their work but also attain practical, applied software engineering experience. Downing took students Ryan Brooks, Samantha Cooper, Tim Sherlock, Amanda Steinwedel and Kevin Wheeler to the academy. Together they began working on a project called GeoMesa. GeoMesa is an open-source, distributed, spatio-temporal database built on top of the Apache Accumulo column family store. Apache Accumulo is a computer software project that developed a sorted, distributed key/value store based on the BigTable technology from Google . The project aims to provide as much of the spatial querying and data manipulation to Accumulo as possible. GeoMesa's concerns range from executing user queries optimally against Accumulo to integrating with GeoTools and GeoServer to provide dynamic, usable visualizations and data analysis. With the broad range of the project, there is room to add new ideas at any number of points along the way. In spring 2014, a course in conjunction with the Facebook Open Academy will be offered through UT Computer Science. CS 378: Open Source Software Engineering will be taught by a chief architect at PayPal, Mike McCartney. The next Facebook Open Academy course wil begin in early February when all participating faculty, students and mentors from around the world fly to Facebook's headquarters for the event.",

The explosive amount of digital data being generated, collected and captured has created an even greater need for parallel processing and interactive exploration capabilities, according to Gaither. Not all people think in terms of statistics and probabilities, but almost everyone thinks visually in varying degrees, she said. Niall Gaffney, TACC\u2019s director of data intensive computing, said: \u201cThis system will be great for big data analysis \u2014 every node in Maverick will have large memory, a state-of-the-art GPU accelerator, and be connected to massive data storage. Data scientists and all researchers will be able to use visual analysis techniques to explore data.\u201d Thanks to generous funding from the O\u2019Donnell Foundation, TACC is now expanding its data-intensive computing infrastructure. In addition to launching Maverick in January, TACC this month is deploying Stockyard , a 20-petabyte large-scale global file system. Other systems for storing and analyzing data sets and for hosting Web portals and gateways that provide access to scientific data will be announced in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely grateful to Peter O\u2019Donnell and his foundation for supporting TACC\u2019s efforts to provide leadership-class systems for data-driven science and data-intensive computing,\u201d said TACC Director Jay Boisseau. Maverick System Specifications Composed of five racks containing 132 HP ProLiant SL250s Gen 8 compute nodes and 14 HP ProLiant management, login and Lustre router servers. Each of the 132 compute nodes will include two 10-core Intel Xeon E5-2680 V2 processors with 256GB of DDR3 1866MHz memory, a Mellanox Connect-X3 FDR InfiniBand FlexibleLOM adaptor, and one NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU accelerator. A Mellanox FDR InfiniBand interconnect will provide a high-performance communication platform. \u201cIncreasingly the limiting factor in HPC systems performance is not just floating point performance but data movement,\u201d said Scott Misage, HPC engineering director at HP. \u201cThe new Maverick system is based on HP ProLiant compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPUs that offer double the GPU memory of previous GPUs, minimizing the need for data movement and enabling new levels of large-scale scientific data analysis.\u201d \u201cMaverick is part of a growing trend in which researchers and technologists are expanding the use of accelerated supercomputers for big data analytics, in addition to traditional science,\u201d said Sumit Gupta, general manager of Tesla Accelerated Computing products at NVIDIA. \u201cCombining HP ProLiant servers with Tesla K40 GPUs, the world\u2019s highest performance accelerators, will give TACC users the fastest computational horsepower for big data analytics with industry-leading visualization capabilities.\u201d In addition, Maverick will offer cloud-like visualization capability and analytics through the ongoing evolution of TACC\u2019s remote visualization software. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to offer our remote visualization suite and services leveraging traditional OpenGL-based visualization applications (VisIt, ParaView), commercial third-party applications (EnSight, Amira), and TACC-developed applications (DisplayCluster, GLuRay),\u201d Gaither said. Maverick, which replaces TACC\u2019s Longhorn system, will be available to the open science community in January 2014 through TACC\u2019s allocation process and the National Science Foundation\u2019s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project.

    "text_content": "Team from Rice, BCM, and UT Austin develop new statistical tools for mining cancer data | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Team from Rice, BCM, and UT Austin develop new statistical tools for mining cancer data Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, November 14, 2013 BIO News Texas A team of researchers at Rice University , Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and the University of Texas at Austin are working together to develop new statistical tools that can find clues about cancer that are hidden like needles in enormous haystacks of raw data. \u201cThe motivation for this is all of these new high-throughput medical technologies that allow clinicians to produce tons of molecular data about cancer,\u201d says project lead Genevera Allen in a Rice U. release . Dr. Allen is an Assistant Professor at Rice University in the Departments of Statistics and the Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy), and at Baylor College of Medicine in the Department of Pediatrics-Neurology. She is also Rice\u2019s Dobelman Family Junior Chair of Statistics, and a member of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital . \u201cFor example,\u201d Dr. Allen notes, \u201cwhen a tumor is removed from a cancer patient, researchers can conduct genomic, proteomic and metabolomic scans that measure nearly every possible aspect of the tumor, including the number and location of genetic mutations and which genes are turned off and on. The end result is that for one tumor, you can have measurements on millions of variables.\u201d This type of data exists \u2014 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has compiled such profiles for thousands of cancer patients \u2014 but scientists don\u2019t yet have a way to use the data to defeat cancer. Dr. Allen and her collaborators hope to change that, thanks to a new $1.3 million federal grant that will allow them to create a new statistical framework for integrated analysis of multiple sets of high-dimensional data measured on the same group of subjects. \u201cThere are a couple of things that make this challenging,\u201d observes Dr. Allen, who is a principal investigator (PI) on the new grant, which was awarded jointly by the National Science Foundation and the NIH. \u201cFirst, the data produced by these high-throughput technologies can be very different, so much so that you get into apples-to-oranges problems when you try in make comparisons. Second, for scientists to leverage all of this data and better understand the molecular basis of cancer, these varied \u2018omics\u2019 data sets need to be combined into a single multivariate statistical model.\u201d For example, Dr. Allen explains in the Rice release that some tests, like gene-expression microarrays and methylation arrays, return \u201ccontinuous data\u201d \u2014 numbers with decimal places that represent the amounts of a particular protein or biomarker. Other tests, like RNA-sequencing, return \u201ccount data\u201d \u2014 integers that indicate how often a biomarker shows up. And for yet other tests, the output is \u201cbinary data.\u201d An example of this would be a test for a specific mutation that produces a zero if the mutation does not occur and a one if it does. \u201cRight now, the state of the art for analyzing these millions of biomarkers would be to create one data matrix \u2014 think one Excel spreadsheet \u2014 where all the numbers are continuous and can be represented with bell-shaped curves,\u201d says Dr. Allen. \u201cThat\u2019s very limiting for two reasons. First, for all noncontinuous variables \u2014 like the binary value related to a specific mutation \u2014 this isn\u2019t useful. Second, we don\u2019t want to just analyze the mutation status by itself. It\u2019s likely that the mutation affects a bunch of these other variables, like epigenetic markers and which genes are turned on and off. Cancer is complex. It\u2019s the result of many things coming together in a particular way. Why should we analyze each of these variables separately when we\u2019ve got all of this data?\u201d She notes that developing a framework where continuous and noncontinuous variables can be analyzed simultaneously won\u2019t be easy. For starters, most of the techniques that statisticians have developed for parallel analysis of three or more variables \u2014 a process called multivariate analysis \u2014 only work for continuous data. \u201cIt is a multivariate problem, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it,\u201d Dr. Allen says. \u201cBut a proper multivariate distribution does not exist for this, so we have to create one mathematically.\u201d To do this, Dr. Allen and her collaborators \u2014 grant co-PIs Zhandong Liu of BCM and Pradeep Ravikumar an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas, Austin \u2014 are creating a mathematical framework that will allow them to find the \u201cconditional dependence relationships\u201d between any two variables. A member of the International Society of Computational Biology, Dr. Zhandong Liu develops bioinformatics approaches for analyzing high-throughput biological data produced by gene expression arrays, RNA-seq and genomic sequencing. His work integrates multiple data types in the interest of advancing our understanding of neurological diseases. Dr. Liu developed a graphical random walk (GRW)-based algorithm that can accurately predict pathway activity from microarray gene expression data. GRW uses gene-gene interaction data to construct a pathway signature in a manner analogous to particle-particle interactions described by Coulomb\u2019s law. By comparing GRW to other standard approaches, he has demonstrated that GRW can sensitively and specifically predict pathway activity across tissues, species, and platforms.The Liu lab\u2019s long-term goal is to develop computational models and algorithms in areas of genomics and computational biology. These tools will allow us to better understand the etiology of neurological diseases from computational and systems biology perspectives. Dr. Ravikumar heads the Statistical Machine Learning Group at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas, Austin , and is the assistant director of an upcoming Center for Big Data Analytics at UT Austin. He is also affiliated with the Division of Statistics and Scientific Computation , and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences . He was Program Chair for the Sixteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2013. His main area of research is in statistical machine learning. The core problem here is to infer conclusions from observations or data. The caveat is to do so reliably with limited computation and limited data. Of particular interest are modern settings where the dimensionality of data is high, and simultaneously achieving these twin objectives is difficult. To illustrate how conditional dependence works, Dr. Allen suggests considering three variables related to childhood growth \u2014 age, IQ and shoe size. In a typical child, all three increase together. \u201cIf we looked at a large dataset, we would see a relationship between IQ and shoe size,\u201d she says. \u201cIn reality, there\u2019s no direct relationship between shoe size and IQ. They happen to go up at the same time, but in reality, each of them is conditionally dependent upon age.\u201d For cancer genes, where the relationships aren\u2019t as obvious, developing a mathematical technique to decipher conditional dependence could avoid the need to rule out such errors through years of expensive and time-consuming biological experiments. Dr. Allen and her collaborators have already illustrated how to use the technique by producing a network model for a half-\u201dmillion biomarkers related to a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma. The model acts as a sort of road map to guide researchers to the relationships that are most important in the data. \u201cAll these lines tell us which genetic biomarkers are conditionally dependent upon one another,\u201d she says in reference to the myriad connections in the model. \u201cThese were all determined mathematically, but our collaborators will test some of these relationships experimentally and confirm that the connections exist.\u201d Dr. Allen says the team\u2019s technique will also be useful for big data challenges that exist in fields ranging from retail marketing to national security. \u201cThis is a very general mathematical framework,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do math. It works for everything.\u201d Collaboration and leadership in genetics and neuroscience have allowed faculty at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital to discover the underlying causes of dozens of neurological disorders. Dr. Allen is also an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at BCM and a member of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute (NRI) at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital that opened in December 2010. Dedicated to improving the lives of patients facing devastating neurological disorders, the NRI is a basic research institute committed to understanding the pathogenesis of neurological diseases with the ultimate goal of developing treatments. The Texas Medical Center (TMC) is the largest in the world, and its institutions treat about 6 million patients each year. The 344,000 square foot silver-level LEED-certified NRI building, nestled in the heart of the TMC, relocates BCM and TCH researchers working on neurodevelopment and neurological diseases under one roof and provides space for us to recruit investigators with complementary areas of expertise. NRI also physically links BCM and TCH to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where University of Texas collaborators lend strength in developmental biology and epigenetics. Most importantly, NRI\u2019s location adjacent to the hospitals fosters relationships between the lab and the clinic, which are integral to the translational research enterprise.

    "text_content": "University of Texas at Austin Unveils Cognitive Computing Course Based on IBM Watson | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content University of Texas at Austin Unveils Cognitive Computing Course Based on IBM Watson Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, May 9, 2014 The University of Texas at Austin's  Department of Computer Science is partnering with IBM to launch a new cognitive computing course titled \u201cAutomated Question Answering\u201d that gives students unprecedented access to one of IBM\u2019s most prized innovations: Watson . The University of Texas at Austin is one of seven universities offering the new course this fall. Watson is a cognitive technology that interacts in natural language, processes vast and disparate forms of big data and learns from each interaction. Watson can sift through and understand massive amounts of big data at unprecedented speeds to assist professionals in understanding data quickly and easily, while increasing knowledge and value over time. Watson famously beat champion players on the TV show Jeopardy! in 2011. The upper-division course, co-designed by Bruce Porter , professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science, along with other leading academic experts and IBM\u2019s Watson Group, will empower students with the technical knowledge and hands-on learning required to develop new cognitive computing applications fueled by Watson\u2019s intelligence. Students will form business teams and have access to their own Watson instance via the Watson Developer Cloud. As a class, they will select an industry to focus on, such as retail, travel or healthcare, and then will work as a team to import relevant data into Watson and train it. Ultimately, the students will break into teams and develop prototype apps and a business plan based on their Watson industry of choice. For example, in the retail domain questions can focus on: \"How can Watson be applied to personalize the consumer shopping experience?\u201d In the travel industry: \"What changes would be applied to help consumers target their next vacation based on their experiences and interests?\u201d As result, each student will gain the perspective and vision of a technology entrepreneur who can transform industries and professions with cloud-delivered expert advisors that think, learn and discover valuable insights from massive amounts of data. This class contributes to an important strategic goal of the Department of Computer Science, according to Professor Porter, \"Watson demonstrates the power of machine learning and data analytics. These are increasingly important technologies that are transforming entire industries and creating new ones. They are important to every top computer science program.\" Over two decades of research, Porter and his team have developed core technologies for automated question answering that have been incorporated into Watson. Four members of the team currently work on the Watson project at IBM. According to research firm Gartner, Inc., smart machines will be the most disruptive change ever brought about by information technology, and can make people more effective, empowering them to do \"the impossible.\" Building on the 4.4 million IT jobs Gartner predicts will be created to support Big Data by 2015, the following universities will educate a new generation of innovators who can bring to life this new dynamic of people and machines working together to solve pressing industry and societal challenges. Other universities offering the course are Carnegie Mellon University, New York University, The Ohio State University, Rennelaer Polytechnic Institute, University of California, Berkeley and The University of Michigan.

Kristen Grauman , her postdoc, Lu Zheng, and doctoral student, Yong Jae Lee, presented their technique named \"story-driven\" video summarization at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition this summer. The major reason for development of the method is that a wearable camera technology such as Google Glass and Looxcie that generate immense amounts of video need summarization. Kristen Grauman, associate professor of computer science in the College of Natural Sciences said, \"The amount of what we call 'egocentric' video, which is video that is shot from the perspective of a person who is moving around, is about to explode.\" She explained, \"We're going to need better methods for summarizing and sifting through this data.\" Grauman and her colleagues\u2019 method automatically examines recorded films and then creates a shorter \"story\" of the video. Military officials will benefit from the technology and easily scan the information from a soldiers' camera, investigators would be able to go through cellphone video data with ease in the wake of disasters, and senior citizens will be able to use video summaries of their days to compensate for memory loss, explained Grauman. Grauman said, \"There's research showing that if people suffering from memory loss wear a camera that takes a snapshot once a minute, and then they review those images at the end of the day, it can help their recall.\" The team of researchers used a combination of methods to give weight to the frames to be added to the summarization. The team then ran human \u201ctaste tests\u201d in order to understand how their method performed with respect to previous methods that were created for the same purpose. Between 75 and 90 percent of people who evaluated the summaries agreed that Grauman and her team\u2019s method was superior.

    "text_content": "Make Coding a Requirement for All UT Students | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Make Coding a Requirement for All UT Students Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, November 11, 2013 THE DAILY TEXAN College students tend to define themselves by their majors, but they need to realize that what they study isn\u2019t a binding contract spelling out what skills they can and cannot develop before graduation. For instance, despite the clear value of computer science as a field of study, coding and programming are often viewed as incomprehensible skills that are reserved for tech wizards. But knowing code is an asset that can be applied to any field of study: As a journalist, you may need to code an online media site. As a linguist, you may want to build a game to help children learn languages. The list goes on and on. So why doesn\u2019t the University realize that it may serve students best by equipping them with coding and programming skills through the core curriculum? The UT computer science department does offer a program called Elements in Computing , designed to give non-majors basic literacy and competency in the subject. Students can either take a few courses individually or work toward either a 12-hour certificate awarded by the department of computer sciences or an 18-hour certificate awarded by the University that are recognized on their official transcripts \u2014 the latter of which would be, notably, visible to employers and thus potentially helpful in a job search. Bill Young , a computer science professor who teaches Elements of Navigating Cyberspace, one of the courses that counts toward the certificate, said that some students who received the certificates have gone on to jobs in computer science. \u201cIt seems to me that one key is making students aware that computing is so ubiquitous that it is needed and helpful for nearly every career path these days,\u201d Young said. \u201cOur Elements program attempts to do that.\u201d Collaborations between the department of computer science and other departments and schools also exist. In the School of Journalism, a class called Mobile News App Design was first introduced last semester to bring journalism and computer science students together and allow them to share knowledge about their respective fields. The ultimate goal of that class is to develop a mobile news app that is good enough to be accepted to the Apple app store by the end of the semester. Next spring, the computer science, fine arts and radio-television-film department are also providing an interdisciplinary program through the Game Development Capstone: 3D Games. Chandrajit Bajaj , a professor of computer science at UT and director of the Computational Visualization Center, said that interdisciplinary courses widely prevalent in graduate curriculum are starting to become increasingly available in undergraduate education, bringing together subjects such as computational mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering and architecture. \u201cComputer science today is at the hub of the wheel, with spokes to all the other sciences and engineering and arts majors,\u201d Bajaj said. Nevertheless, despite these attempts by the department of computer science to reach out and integrate non-majors, the efforts may be not be widespread enough to give all students the basic computer science tool kit which is currently only an \u201cadvantage\u201d in the job market but may soon be a requirement. Not everyone has the space in his or her degree plan to participate in the Elements of Computing program, and the number of students who do enroll in this program is small. Compared to the vastly more popular Business Foundations Program, which gives out approximately 1,100 certificates a year, only 19 students received a certificate from the Elements in Computing program last year. Additionally, acceptance into the journalism and RTF classes can be competitive. Given the low number of non-computer science majors that are actually learning these skills, UT should consider lobbying the Texas Higher Education Coordinating board to include computer science in the state-mandated core curriculum, or else include it in the University-mandated core curriculum. Bajaj, for one, said that he strongly supports the addition of basic computer science to the core curriculum. Incorporating required core classes on coding and programming would be a relief for students, not an added stress. It\u2019s shameful how many times I\u2019ve told myself to go to Code Academy, a free website that teaches various coding and programming \u201clanguages\u201d such HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and Python, and yet never made the time. Amid a busy schedule, the personal motivation isn\u2019t there, despite the clear value of learning to code before entering the job market. Required coding classes would become a part of a student\u2019s schedule, creating an immediate incentive with a big payback: being able to graduate. It\u2019s true that under the current UT core curriculum, students may take a computer science class to count toward a science and technology requirement. However, making computer science classes compulsory is an idea worth consideration. UT\u2019s 42-hour core curriculum is, admittedly, decided in large part by the notoriously-slow moving Texas Higher Education Coordinating board and, consequently, is unlikely to change anytime soon. But hopefully, the growing realization that technological skills provide huge benefits for students will inspire the inclusion of classes that teach basic coding skills into the core curriculum in the years to come.

    "text_content": "Professor continues research on video summarization technology | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor continues research on video summarization technology Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, September 24, 2013 THE DAILY TEXAN Researchers at the University are working to perfect a computer algorithm designed to summarize first-person perspective films, with the hope of aiding the elderly and memory-impaired. Kristen Grauman , a computer science associate professor and project leader, said her team produced an algorithm capable of analyzing long segments of video and creating short, storyboard summaries. The algorithm uses a combination of machine-learning technology and optimization to predict the important elements in a video and demonstrate how they are connected. The story-driven video summarization technology is the first of its kind to focus on egocentric video, rather than on video shot from a stationary camera. Grauman said this perspective allows for greater applications of the summarizing feature and may be of use for memory-impaired individuals. \u201cIf you think about who needs a first-person video summarized, you first think about life loggers, people who just do this for fun or for social media,\u201d Gruman said. \u201cBut also what I would say are even more serious applications are clinical health or elder care kind of things where you need to monitor someone\u2019s ability to do activities of daily living, or to help them recap or re-experience visual memories to help them jog [their] memory.\u201d Grauman said that while there are many uses for the technology, her team is focused on developing a more basic application. \u201cThe data that we have now is more of a daily living kind of thing,\u201d Grauman said. \u201cIf you talk about commercializing then you could think about specializing for specific application needs. We\u2019re just focused on things we can come up with that would most likely be relevant for any kind of scenario.\u201d Grauman conducted her initial research with former postdoctoral research fellow Lu Zheng and former doctoral student Yong Jae Lee. Lee said his role focused on how to use machine-learning techniques in order to make the technology predict important objects. \u201cSince the video can be many hours, we aimed to find the frames that contain the most important people and objects,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn order to find these frames, we train an algorithm to predict important image regions using egocentric cues, like how often objects appear in the center of the frame.\u201d Zheng said he worked closely with Grauman in order to shape their ideas and formulate solutions to problems they encountered. \u201cI was mainly responsible for coming out with the research ideas, working on details of the algorithm, programming the algorithm and designing and performing experiments,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cProfessor Grauman worked with [us] closely in various ways, such as shaping the initial idea and suggesting possible solutions to difficulties encountered along the way.\u201d Grauman and her team published several papers over the two years they spent working in this area of computer science, but she said the technology still has a lot of growing and evolving to do. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting better and looking at more technical problems that arise based on what we\u2019ve done so far,\u201d Grauman said. \u201cYou could certainly release some version of what we\u2019re researching right now, but there\u2019s just so much room for innovation and improvement.\u201d News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Research Tags Kristen Grauman Lu Zheng Yong Jae Lee",

The award entitled, \"Statistical Methods for Integrated Analysis of High-Throughput Biomedical Data\", was granted to Dr. Zhandong Liu, assistant professor of pediatrics at BCM and the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital (NRI); Dr. Genevera Allen, assistant professor of pediatrics-neurology at BCM and the NRI as well as assistant professor of statistics and electrical engineering at Rice University; Dr. Matthew Anderson, assistant professor of OB/GYN at BCM; and Dr. Pradeep Ravikumar , assistant professor of computer science at UT - Austin. The grant will support their research focused on statistical tools needed to analyze and \"mine\"data to discover biomarkers, drug targets, disrupted disease networks and disease sub-types. Liu and his colleagues will seek to address two issues that have made this effort challenging. First, next generation sequencing technology produces varied data sets that do not fit into standard statistical models. Second, in order for scientists to leverage all of their data and understand the complete molecular basis of disease, these varied sets need to be combined into a unified statistical model. Their proposal seeks to address these two issues with a new statistical framework for integrated analysis of multiple sets of high-dimensional data. This research will be applied to cancer genomics data and will have the potential to make scientific discoveries critical for personalized medicine. Beyond medicine, the theoretical framework and statistical methods could lead to significant advances in the theory of exponential families, statistical learning and the emerging field of integrative analysis.

    "text_content": "TACC Longhorn Takes On Natural Language Processing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content TACC Longhorn Takes On Natural Language Processing Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, June 14, 2013 HPC Wire For all the progress we've made in IT over the last 50 years, there's one area of life that has steadfastly eluded the grasp of computers: understanding human language. Now, researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) are utilizing a Hadoop cluster on its Longhorn supercomputer to move the state of the art of language processing a little bit further. Over the years, programmers have tried many different ways to improve the capability of computers to understand human language. IBM found some success with the brute force approach with Watson, which was loaded with 4 terabytes of dictionary and encyclopedia entries. While the Power-based system won the game show Jeopardy!, it flubbed an easy one on the show, when its question for an answer in the \"US cities\" category was \"What is Toronto?\" The problem of natural language processing is not an easy nut to crack. Exactly replicating a human's method for understanding speech--which involves a combination of context, syntax, logic, and a sense of the speaker's intention (what tripped up Watson)--is not (yet) a suitable option to take with computers. But a new project at the University of Texas at Austin hopes to improve one aspect of natural language processing: understanding context. Katrin Erk, a professor of linguistics at the university, figures that if hard coding word meanings into a computer doesn't work, then giving a computer a better model for determine meanings just might. Erk's approach assumes a vast, multi-dimensional space where words and their meanings live. The further apart the words are in the model, the further apart their meanings. In particular, the approach helps the computer to parse homonyms, like \"charge,\" which have multiple meanings. \"An intuition for me was that you could visualize the different meanings of a word as points in space,\" Erk says in a story on the TACC website . \"You could think of them as sometimes far apart, like a battery charge and criminal charges, and sometimes close together, like criminal charges and accusations\u2026The meaning of a word in a particular context is a point in this space. Then we don't have to say how many senses a word has. Instead we say: 'This use of the word is close to this usage in another sentence, but far away from the third use.'\" Erk's model required a lot of human text (books, etc) to work. In 2009, she started loading digitized works into her model, which resided on a desktop computer. This approach may have worked for a few million words, but what Erk really needed to flesh out her model was lots of human text, or billions of words. That's where TACC and the Hadoop subsystem on the Longhorn supercomputer come in. \"With Hadoop on Longhorn, we could get the kind of data that we need to do language processing much faster,\" Erk says. \"That enabled us to use larger amounts of data and develop better models.\" In addition to creating a word cloud, Erk and her collaborators, including University of Texas computer science professor Ray Mooney , expanded the model to measure the closeness of whole sentences, which is an even more computationally complex task than measuring word meanings. Researchers loaded one sentence into the system, and asked Hadoop to determine if another sentence was true based on the first. Hadoop scored an 85 percent accuracy rate on this test. Erk and Mooney were recently awarded a DARPA grant to explore the possibilities of their model. \"We want to get to a point where we don't have to learn a computer language to communicate with a computer. We'll just tell it what to do in natural language,\" Mooney said. \"We're still a long way from having a computer that can understand language as well as a human being does, but we've made definite progress toward that goal.\" News Categories Faculty Research Tags natural language processing Ray Mooney",

    "text_content": "Disruptions: How Driverless Cars Could Reshape Cities | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Disruptions: How Driverless Cars Could Reshape Cities Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, July 8, 2013 New York Times | Nick Bilton SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 By now, seeing one of Google\u2019s experimental, driverless cars zipping down Silicon Valley\u2019s Highway 101, or parking itself on a San Francisco street, is not all that unusual. Indeed, as automakers like Audi, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz make plans for self-driving vehicles, it is only a matter of time before such cars become a big part of the great American traffic jam. While driverless cars might still seem like science fiction outside the Valley, the people working and thinking about these technologies are starting to ask what these autos could mean for the city of the future. The short answer is \u201ca lot.\u201d Imagine a city where you don\u2019t drive in loops looking for a parking spot because your car drops you off and scoots off to some location to wait, sort of like taxi holding pens at airports. Or maybe it is picked up by a robotic minder and carted off with other vehicles, like a row of shopping carts. Inner-city parking lots could become parks. Traffic lights could be less common because hidden sensors in cars and streets coordinate traffic. And, yes, parking tickets could become a rarity since cars would be smart enough to know where they are not supposed to be. As scientists and car companies forge ahead \u2014 many expect self-driving cars to become commonplace in the next decade \u2014 researchers, city planners and engineers are contemplating how city spaces could change if our cars start doing the driving for us. There are risks, of course: People might be more open to a longer daily commute, leading to even more urban sprawl. That city of the future could have narrower streets because parking spots would no longer be necessary. And the air would be cleaner because people would drive less. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 30 percent of driving in business districts is spent in a hunt for a parking spot, and the agency estimates that almost one billion miles of driving is wasted that way every year. \u201cWhat automation is going to allow is repurposing, both of spaces in cities, and of the car itself,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who specializes in robotics and drones. Harvard University researchers note that as much as one-third of the land in some cities is devoted to parking spots. Some city planners expect that the cost of homes will fall as more space will become available in cities. If parking on city streets is reduced and other vehicles on roadways become smaller, homes and offices will take up that space. Today\u2019s big-box stores and shopping malls require immense areas for parking, but without those needs, they could move further into cities. The Autonomous Intersection Management project, created by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, imagines cities where traffic lights no longer exist but sensors direct the flow of traffic. Although a video showing off the automated traffic intersection looks like total chaos, the researchers insist that such intersections will reduce congestion and fuel costs and can allow cars to drive through cities without stopping. Of course, getting to a utopian city will take a little longer than circling the block looking for a spot. A spokesman for Audi said a fully automated car would not be available until the end of the decade. And the regulatory issues to be addressed before much of this could come true are, to put it mildly, forbidding. But the pieces are starting to fall into place, at least enough to excite future-minded thinkers. Last year, Jerry Brown, the governor of California, signed legislation paving the way for driverless cars in California, making it the third state to explicitly allow the cars on the road. And federal agencies are starting to consider their impact. In May the Transportation Department made its first formal policy statement on autonomous vehicles, encouraging cities to allow testing of driverless cars. But to some, this promise \u2014 or overpromise as the case may be \u2014 sounds familiar. \u201cThe future city is not going to be a congestion-free environment. That same prediction was made that cars would free cities from the congestion of horses on the street,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and a member of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford. \u201cYou have to build the sewer system to accommodate the breaks during the Super Bowl; it won\u2019t be as pretty as we\u2019re envisioning.\u201d Mr. Smith has an alternative vision of the impact of automated cars, which he believes are inevitable. Never mind that nice city center. He says that driverless cars will allow people to live farther from their offices and that the car could become an extension of home. \u201cI could sleep in my driverless car, or have an exercise bike in the back of the car to work out on the way to work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time spent in my car will essentially be very different.\u201d \u201cDriverless cars won\u2019t appear in a vacuum,\u201d Mr. Smith said. Other predictions for the future city imagine fewer traditional-looking cars. Taking their place will be drones and robots that deliver goods. Oh, and that food-delivery car double-parked outside? That, Mr. Calo said, will be replaced by a delivery drone.

    "text_content": "Student Entrepreneurs Meet With President Obama | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Student Entrepreneurs Meet With President Obama Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, May 9, 2013 Austin, TX \u2014 Student entrepreneurs and computer science faculty met with President Obama on Thursday to showcase new student ventures from the Longhorn Startup Program. President Barack Obama chose Austin as the first stop on his Middle Class Jobs and Opportunities tour for its reputation as a hub for innovation, technology, and education. The president\u2019s visit included a stop at Capital Factory, a high-tech startup incubator founded by entrepreneur Josh Baer, an instructor with the department of computer science who teaches and co-leads the Longhorn Startup Program. Chris Slaughter, engineering student and CEO of Longhorn Startup\u2019s Lynx Laboratories, gave the president a demonstration of the company\u2019s 3D camera. The camera is supported by student-developed software that can capture and help accurately render all the 3D surfaces in a room. Lynx Laboratories was presented as an example of the innovation coming out of both the university and the vibrant Austin entrepreneurship scene. In addition, the White House issued a statement saying that, \u201cPresident Obama will meet with entrepreneurs at the Capital Factory\u2014a startup incubator\u2014who are already leveraging open government data to create new products and services as part of his new series of middle-class jobs and opportunity tours to highlight how a growing, thriving middle class is critical to America\u2019s economic future.\" The meeting served to highlight the executive order he issued on the same day making government data available to the public in machine-readable formats to enable entrepreneurs and researchers to use the data to create new businesses and services. The president also announced his intention to create three new manufacturing innovation institutes, where businesses, universities, and government would partner to develop new manufacturing technologies. Started in 2011, Longhorn Startup is a course designed to give entrepreneurial support to undergraduates at The University of Texas at Austin. An interdisciplinary project led by computer science\u2019s Josh Baer and engineering\u2019s Bob Metcalfe, the Longhorn Startup is open to all UT Austin undergraduates who have ventures or are launching companies. As part of the program, each startup team is connected to an entrepreneur mentor from the Austin area. In addition to mentoring, students gain business, networking and presentation skills during the one semester course.

With events like trivia geek-outs, inspirational talks and discussions, yoga, photo booths, and a banquet with faculty members, members were out in full force, whether that meant attending events, advocating for them, or just talking about them. \u201cAll the events have been really fun so far,\u201d CS sophomore Emma Stearman said. \u201cAnd the fact that it\u2019s even happening shows that the school cares about us, there is a support system, and gives us a really good opportunity to network with one another.\u201d Networking isn\u2019t always easy in computer science, but WiCS knows how to bring all the CS majors together: food. Between hor d'oeuvres, bar-b-q, breakfast tacos, and of course, Tiff\u2019s Treats, there was a meal at almost every event. \u201cA lot of people have come. It\u2019s really nice to see people sitting down and eating and talking, not just taking the food and going away,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cPeople are coming in and actually participating in the events. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d Even though the event drew to a close on Friday, it ended with something to brag about. \u201cI think so many people learned about Women in Computer Science, got to benefit from it, got to meet other people in computer science,  and meet professors,\u201d said Hinkle. \u201cIt was great. It was a great success.\u201d With such a success this year, students can\u2019t help but think about the future of WiCS. \u201cHopefully this week has raised awareness of WiCS, shown that it\u2019s a group for guys and girls.\u201d Stearman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s proved that we\u2019re a strong presence within the department, and we\u2019ll continue to grow every year.\u201d News Categories Outreach Undergraduate Students Tags Student Organization WICS Women in Computer Science",

What do you get when you bring journalism students together with computer science students? Five teams working on creating mobile apps and getting them into the iPhone app store by semester\u2019s end. Robert Quigley , a senior lecturer in journalism, designed the class not knowing whether that expectation could be met. But by App Demo Day, on April 27, the proof was in the presentations. Journalism students learned code, while computer science students learned more about the journalism industry. Teams pitched, designed, coded and marketed their apps through blog posts and social media, with help from local entrepreneur Joshua McClure. \u201cJournalists and computer scientists are carrying similar tool boxes these days so we\u2019re trying to learn each other\u2019s language,\u201d says Wanda Garner Cash , associate director of the School of Journalism and one of the competition\u2019s judges. Cash adds the course is a good example of how the School of Journalism\u2019s new undergraduate curriculum is synching with changes in the news and information business. At Demo Day on April 27, judges named Glos Guide \u2014 an ioS AP Style reference guide and study tool \u2014 the Best Overall App. Available on iTunes , the 99-cent app includes style rules, bookmarks capability and journalistic tips. \u201cBecause this class is in the School of Journalism, we thought, \u2018Why not make an app to help journalism students?\u2019\u201d says Monica Zhang , Glos Guide team member and senior journalism student. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous calling card for any student,\u201d says Rodney Gibbs , a competition judge and chief innovation officer for The Texas Tribune, who believes the app-building experience will set students apart from 75 percent of journalism job applicants. \u201cA successful applicant to our organization cannot survive on writing alone. He must at least be able to collaborate with technologists \u2014 be they app developers, data journalists or programmers. And if he has experience creating an app, managing a tech team and finding a market for his app? That\u2019s like an actor who can sing and dance, too. In showbiz they call that person a triple-threat,\u201d Gibbs says. Other apps included: Pxljam , a photo-sharing app that bridges fans and music artists (Voted \u201cBest Design\u201d and \u201cBest Commercial Value\u201d) PicBook , an iPad app that aggregates Facebook photos and allows users to create scrapbooks (Voted \u201cMost Original\u201d) Prix-Party , a Formula 1 Austin event guide (Voted \u201cBest Presentation\u201d) Nerv , an app that provides local, social news for urban travelers Judges included Cash; Gibbs; Gerald Bailey , founder of SnakeHead Software; Carmen Cano , general manager, digital and innovation at The Dallas Morning News; Debbie Hiott , editor of The Austin American-Statesman; and Christopher Visit , founding principal of Frank+Victor Design. In the fall of 2013, the School of Journalism will offer a similar class: Introduction to Mobile Programming for Journalists. The course will prepare journalism students for Mobile News App Design, which will be offered again in the spring of 2014.

    "text_content": "UT Mobile Design Students Present 5 Apps at Demo Day | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Mobile Design Students Present 5 Apps at Demo Day Posted by Staff Writer on Sunday, April 28, 2013 SILICONHILLS NEWS Two years ago, UT journalism professor Robert Quigley had an idea \u2013 put together University of Texas students from both the journalism and computer science schools with the goal of producing commercially viable mobile apps in a single semester. Recently, Quigley posted the following on Facebook: \u201cThis class was just a blurry idea a year ago. Today, one of my student groups \u2013 Glos Guide for Journalists \u2013 got an app in the Apple App Store. Amazing work for a team of undergrads to pull this off in one semester.\u201d The Mobile News App Design class held their first ever Demo Day at the Belo Center for New Media at the University of Texas Austin campus on Saturday. The class produced five apps \u2014 all of which will be available in the Apple App Store at some point. Students will be able to keep the revenue. Judges from several different news organizations provided feedback and advice to the student developers and gave them awards. The Glos Guide for Journalists iPhone app won Best Overall App. It is essentially a quick reference guide for the AP stylebook \u2013 the official grammar, punctuation, and practices guide of the U.S. news industry. The app breaks down rules into categories for easy navigation, and allows users to bookmark and print out rules in a PDF format. The students who created the Glos Guide consulted different journalism professionals throughout its development. As a result, they compiled a resource of tips and advice given by each professional. Users can search these journalism tips by author. Several UT journalism professors contributed advice, including Robert Quigley and Kate Dawson. The app does not include the complete AP stylebook \u2013 that would have caused a copyright issue \u2013 but it does include basic hard-to-find rules such as when to capitalize directions such as \u201cnorth\u201d. It is available in the Apple App Store for 99 cents. One of the reasons for the Glos Guide\u2019s success was the simplicity of the product, as the team was careful to avoid a problem known as \u201cfeature creep\u201d. \u201cSome of the more successful apps are the apps that are just simpler in nature,\u201d said Event Judge Chris Visit of Frank+Victor design. \u201cApps that are resources tend to be the most successful because they have a finite universe of content. You\u2019re not aggregating data or dealing with user submissions.\u201d The most news-related app of the bunch was Nerv, a newsfeed app that piggybacks on Twitter. Nerv aggregates credible twitter news handles for major cities, and makes them easily searchable. The app\u2019s goal is to help users find out what is going on quickly and easily. \u201cThe big difference is that it\u2019s credible,\u201d said UT computer science senior Jonathan Long. \u201cIt is definitely easier to use and the information is more readily available.\u201d Currently the app only covers Austin, Boston, San Francisco and Portland; but the team is looking at adding more cities. Nerv is available in the App Store for free. Long hopes that local businesses in these cities will want to work with their app to provide better information and perhaps some revenue. The one iPad app of the bunch was PicBook \u2013 a scrapbooking app integrated with Facebook. PicBook works with the picture tags in Facebook to let users pull the photos they have in common with one or multiple friends. Once the pictures load, the iPad app will automatically resize them to fit in a digital scrapbook were users can easily move and rotate the photos. Users can also add text, colorful backgrounds, and other touches to their digital scrapbook. Implementing a good graphic design was a major challenge for all the teams, and PicBook\u2019s biggest development issue was keeping the layout clean and simple enough for anyone to use the PicBook interface. \u201cIt was hard to decide how to set up the pages so that they were really intuitive to use and also looked aesthetically pleasing,\u201d said journalism graduate student Jeana Bertoldi. \u201cFor the journalism students it was hard to make the design, and then for them (Computer Science students) it was hard to implement the design.\u201d PicBook will have a freemium business model where the core app is free and users can purchase additional features. The PicBook team is now putting the finishing touches on the app and will submit it to the App Store next month. They will eventually incorporate a website where users can upload and compare their PicBooks. Users will also be able to post the PicBooks to their Facebook pages. An app with a more narrow news approach was Prix-Party \u2013 which focused on Formula One racing news. Designed to keep people keep connected to Formula One events, the app keeps track of the location, time, and cost of the events around Austin with a simple list view. The Prix-Party team worked closely with Kevin Olsen at The Austin Grand Prix to bring the app to market. Additionally, their app collects Formula One tweets so users know what the racing community is talking about. The Prix-Party team experienced the pressures of a real world app development cycle first hand, giving them valuable experience in working with team dynamics. \u201cAt first our team was getting along great, and then as the pressure began to build we started to have this stormy phase where we were getting irritated with each other,\u201d said journalism senior Caleb Ingles. \u201cIt got to the point where we had no choice but to figure out a way to work together.\u201d \u201cYou have to learn a lot about project management,\u201d said computer science major Angela Deng. \u201cIf you don\u2019t manage things right you\u2019re going to hold up your entire team and just waste time.\u201d The Prix-Party app will be submitted to the App Store a few weeks from now. The students have already created an iPhone style commercial for the app. Last but not least is Pxljam . This app is designed to give the \u201c360 concert experience\u201d by allowing all the users who attend a concert to easily upload the photos to a consolidated gallery accessible with the Pxljam app. After a fan takes a concert picture, they add the name of the band and the location before uploading the image. Pxljam will then collect all these images and sort them. The Pxljam team realizes that their app\u2019s success depends on how many users upload content, so they have focused a lot of development time on promoting their app through social media in order to create a pre-release fan base. One of the biggest challenges the Pxljam team faced was settling on a layout design and style for the product that really represented who they are. \u201cWe went through so many phases of what Pxljam was,\u201d said journalism graduate student Carlos Morales. \u201cThe hardest part was coming to a point where we could say \u2018ok, this is what it is.\u2019\u201d Pxljam has already been submitted to the App Store as a free download, and will notify fans on their Pxljam Facebook page when the app is live. They hope to work with Austin music venues to begin creating revenue. The Mobil News App Design course was the first class of its kind at the journalism school of the University of Texas in Austin. The class was composed of 13 computer science students and 13 journalism students. Senior Lecturer Robert Quigley led the class from a journalism perspective. Austin tech entrepreneur Joshua McClure mentored the class on the app development and computer science side. Students in both disciplines had to quickly learn basic skills in iOS coding language \u201cObjective C\u201d, as well as Photoshop skills, app layout principles, and the basic principles of media and journalism. \u201cThe idea was to bridge the two disciplines and try to make journalists who can apply to geek jobs and know that they\u2019re going to get it because they have the experience of having built an app,\u201d said journalism professor Robert Quigley. \u201cAnd also to give the computer science students more of a well rounded communications perspective.\u201d Quigley originally pitched the idea for the class to Journalism School Director Glenn Frankel and Associate Director Wanda Cash more than a year ago. After this class\u2019s success, the Journalism School will continue to pursue app design courses. Quigley will help create an Intro to Mobile Programming for Journalists course this fall, which will be taught by freelance iPhone developer Jeff Linwood who helped teach coding in this inaugural class. The class has been posted and is already full. Professor Quigley is more than impressed with the students in his first app design class, and can\u2019t wait to teach the next Mobile News App Design class In spring of 2014. \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably proud of my students. They worked so hard. They were so creative. They had so much fun. They learned so much. I can\u2019t put it into words how exciting this is for me,\u201d said Quigley. \u201cThis was a really special class.\u201d News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags application development mobile applications UT Mobile Design",

    "text_content": "Glenn Downing Spearheads Collaborative Open Source Project Course | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Glenn Downing Spearheads Collaborative Open Source Project Course Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, July 9, 2013 The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science (UTCS) collaborated with Facebook and 12 universities from Europe, China and the United States to provide practical, collaborative software engineering experience as part of its computer science curriculum. UTCS Professor Glenn Downing joined Facebook's Faculty Thought Leader Council to spearhead a project course at UTCS that aimed to better prepare motivated CS students of any background to succeed in professional software environments. The class\u2014designed to provide students with the expertise, insight and learning opportunities in the areas of software engineering\u2014combined student teams with a select group of open source software projects. The course leveraged asynchronous learning, a student-centered teaching method that utilizes online learning resources to facilitate information sharing among a network of people. Student teams spanned universities to produce better learning outcomes by promoting shared lessons and experiences and by forcing a greater investment in team communication and coordination. The philosophy behind the class was that the best way to learn software engineering is to do software engineering. Teams of three to eight students learned by doing, by working within an established open source code base. This is different than most project courses that have the students begin their projects from scratch; learning how to get a handle on a code base and build understanding of it to the point where one can make coding contributions is a valuable skill that is called upon repeatedly in a professional software engineering role. The student teams worked to improve their project in two ways: by knocking out low hanging fruit issues that already existed and by identifying and pursuing new functionality they conceived. The student teams worked on their projects for anywhere from 8-20 weeks, depending upon the schedules of the universities involved. Glenn originally sent out a request for application to previous students in his classes and chose three to be a part of the program: Daniel Jordan, a Turing Scholar; Alex Coomans and Adrian Maceiras, both seniors. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the first projects I've worked on that has been really collaborative,\u201d said Alex Coomans. Glenn\u2019s students collaborated on MongoDB , an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind, and got acquainted with a giant software stack with which many of them had no previous experience, including Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, RSpec, Jasmine, Paper.JS, Capybara, Devise, CanCan, OmniAuth, Guard, and MongoMapper. They learned to create op count graphs to track operations per time on a database in real time, Ajax requests and jQuery. Adrian \u201clearned a ton about ruby idioms, the rails ecosystem, and open source development in general.\u201d They learned how to integrate the Jasmine testing framework into MongoTools and to build authentication and authorization for MongoTools. Overall, the project was a success for Glenn and his students. \u201cI think it was a very positive experience and I would definitely do it again,\u201d says Glenn. Daniel said he learned a lot and was very grateful for the experience. Adrian described the class as an \u201cincredibly fun and useful experience.\u201d News Categories Faculty Industry Relations Undergraduate Program Tags Facebook Glenn Downing Stanford University",

For the 2nd year in a row, UT's team won the student cluster overall competition at the international Student Cluster conference! At SC13 in Denver, our team defeated teams from China's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT--the leading HPC institution in China, and maker of the current #1 system in the world), Australia's 5-institution consortium team, and Germany (Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremburg), as well as teams from a Massachusetts university consortium, U. Colorado, U. of the Pacific (put together by LBL), and the faux UT (Knoxville, via their joint institute with ORNL). The team was expertly coached by Carlos Rosales, John Cazes, and John Lockman of TACC, and had two of last year's championship team members as student advisors: Michael Teng (CS) and Andrew Wiley (CS, ECE). Thank you to Raytheon for sponsoring this year's team. Student Cluster Competition Eight student teams from universities in the United States, Germany, China and Australia were selected to compete in the Standard Track of the Student Cluster Competition at SC13. This year\u2019s teams include the first ever team from Australia, who traveled nearly 9,000 miles from Perth for the competition. Competition Details Prior to the competition, a team works with its advisor and vendor partners to design and build a cutting-edge, commercially available small cluster constrained by the 26-amp power limit (Standard track) or $2500 USD cost limit and a 15-amp power limit (Commodity track).  Teams were encouraged to enlist the help of domain specialists to assist with building, tuning, and understanding how the applications work. A fourth mystery application was revealed on Monday night when the competition officially kicked off. During SC13, teams assemble, test, and tune their machines and run the HPCC benchmarks until the starting bell rang at the Exhibit Opening Gala, when they were given the competition data sets for all four applications.  In full view of conference attendees, teams executed the prescribed workload while showing progress and science visualization output on large high-resolution displays in their areas. Teams race to correctly complete the greatest number of application runs during the competition period until the close of the exhibit floor on Wednesday evening. The showcase portion of the competition allowed teams to show off what they\u2019ve learned and what they can do with their equipment. Veteran HPC experts were present to judge the visualizations and interviewed each team on their cluster and application knowledge. The winning team in each track was based on a combined score for workload completed, benchmark performance, conference attendance, and interviews.  Recognition was given for the highest LINPACK (Standard track) and FLOPS-per-dollar LINPACK (Commodity track).

The University of Texas was the first public school system to join the partnership, which previously consisted of Harvard, MIT, and UC Berkeley. The goal of EdX is to transform the foundations of both teaching and learning by enabling the global exchange of information and ideas. UT faculty members will work with other members of the consortium to improve teaching and learning on campus by conducting extensive research on how students learn. This research will provide the knowledge necessary to build new technologies that will help transform teaching and learning worldwide. President Powers expressed excitement in the UT System\u2019s decision to join EdX, explaining UT\u2019s longstanding commitment \u201cnot only to embracing breakthroughs in education, but also helping create them.\u201d The partnership with EdX will allow the University of Texas to become a leader in online education and will also help the University meet the needs of a wider range of students. UTCS will contribute to UTx with a course titled \"Linear Algebra: Theory and Algorithms\", to be developed by Prof. Robert van de Geijn and Dr. Maggie Myers. This course will present introductory linear algebra from a computer science perspective. By linking the theory of linear algebra to issues that arise when implementing high-performance libraries, the course content will connect the mathematics to issues encountered in computer architecture, software engineering, and program correctness. The course will build on ongoing research by the instructors on how to develop and implement high-performance linear algebra libraries, funded by the National Science Foundation, so that the participant will simultaneously be exposed to introductory material and the cutting edge of the field. Students from around the globe will be able to sign up for this course, along with eight other massive open online courses (MOOCs), in the 2013-2014 school year. These courses, which will award students with certificates of mastery rather than course credit, will cover a variety of topics, with titles ranging from \u201cJazz Appreciation\u201d to \u201cFoundations of Data Analysis,\u201d and will be designed and led by award-winning faculty here at the University.

UTCS Professor Glenn Downing joined Facebook's Faculty Thought Leader Council to spearhead a project course at UTCS that aimed to better prepare motivated CS students of any background to succeed in professional software environments. The class\u2014designed to provide students with the expertise, insight and learning opportunities in the areas of software engineering\u2014combined student teams with a select group of open source software projects. The course leveraged asynchronous learning, a student-centered teaching method that utilizes online learning resources to facilitate information sharing among a network of people. Student teams spanned universities to produce better learning outcomes by promoting shared lessons and experiences and by forcing a greater investment in team communication and coordination. The philosophy behind the class was that the best way to learn software engineering is to do software engineering. Teams of three to eight students learned by doing, by working within an established open source code base. This is different than most project courses that have the students begin their projects from scratch; learning how to get a handle on a code base and build understanding of it to the point where one can make coding contributions is a valuable skill that is called upon repeatedly in a professional software engineering role.

    "text_content": "Rock Snot Genomics | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Rock Snot Genomics Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, April 19, 2013 [Originally published on the website of the Texas Advanced Computing Center ( TACC )] Maybe you\u2019ve heard the old joke: What\u2019s the worst thing you can do to a boat? Put it in the water. Once a boat enters the water, microorganisms begin accumulating on its surfaces, creating a significant amount of drag and a big mess. This may not matter for a small fishing boat, but for giant container ships, the drag created by microorganisms\u2014in particular single-celled, silica-shelled organisms called diatoms \u2014results in a significant amount of fuel loss every year. Diatoms are one of the most common types of phytoplankton and a major group of algae. They constitute a large percentage of all living matter in oceans, rivers and lakes. One species, Didymosphenia geminata , is responsible for creating thick blooms in mountain streams and ponds. It is colloquially known as didymo or rock snot . The species is a menace to hospitals as well, where it can coat moist surfaces and promote bacteria by secreting mucilage that supports all types of growth. For researchers in the lab of Edward Theriot at The University of Texas at Austin, diatoms (and their snot) are rich objects of biological research. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of thousands of species out there in every body of water you can think of in the world,\u201d said Matt Ashworth, a researcher in the lab. \u201cThey\u2019re a very successful group, a relatively young group, and we\u2019re interested in understanding how they\u2019ve evolved and colonized different ecosystems.\u201d For decades, diatoms resisted study. Their genome is notoriously difficult to analyze. Morphological studies, based on the shape of a species\u2019 shell or other features, often contradicted the results of molecular testing. However, next-generation sequencing methods, in combination with computational techniques and powerful supercomputers, are helping researchers better understand the biology, evolution and dispersal of the diatom. Using these new tools, researchers are trying to answer a number of basic questions about diatom evolution: What were the earliest diatoms like? How has the organism moved from a single site to every body of water in the world? And how have some species developed the ability to produce prodigious amounts of snot? The Search for the Ur-Diatom Researchers have sought to understand what the diatom\u2019s original ancestor might have looked like. Though Theriot and his team are still in the early stages of their analysis, some of their results are consistent enough that they can start to paint a picture of how the so-called \u201cur-diatom\u201d may have appeared. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that the early diatom was a small flagellate, but what we\u2019re finding at the base of the diatom tree are things that are long and tubular, much like the tube inside of a paper towel roll,\u201d said Edward Theriot, professor of molecular evolution at The University of Texas at Austin and director of its Texas Natural Science Center . \u201cIn the diatom world, this is a radical view, but it\u2019s exactly what the tree is telling us.\u201d To come to this conclusion, the researchers analyzed ribosomal and chloroplast genes of more than 200 diatoms and Bolidomonas (a closely related genus). They wanted to test the prevailing understanding of where certain diatoms fall on the evolutionary tree, and included species used as models in genomic studies and diatoms whose placement in the diatom phylogeny has been problematic or controversial. After generating massive amounts of data using next-generation gene sequencers, they used the Ranger supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to align, organize and analyze the DNA data, and to run phylogenetic programs that sketched out the evolution of diatoms as a whole. \u201cThere are a number of programs that compare DNA sequences and estimate how those DNA sequences evolved from each other, and some of these have very complex algorithms,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cBefore we had access to Ranger it would take weeks and months to run. Ranger does the same analyses in hours. So it\u2019s been a very powerful tool to give us quick ideas about how different strains are related to each other.\u201d The time that Ranger saves the researchers doesn\u2019t just get them to an answer faster. It also allows them to test many alternative hypotheses. \u201cSometimes, the best tree from molecular data looks radically different from what morphology tells us to expect,\u201d Theriot explained. \u201cWith Ranger, we can redirect our time away from just finding the best tree for a dataset, towards asking how different that best tree is from what scholars thought about diatom evolution, say, 100 years ago.\u201d Using a statistical comparative approach, the researchers arrived at a different tree of diatom evolution than traditionally conceived, and a different point of origin. They reported some of their early findings at the XXII International Diatom Colloquium in August 2012 and they continue to investigate the sequencing results in light of previous research. So how does the didymo make all that mucus? For some of the lab\u2019s more focused studies, like the evolution of the rock snot\u2019s mucus-producing capability, the researchers sequenced the transcriptomes (all of the messenger RNA molecules expressed from an organism\u2019s genes) of half a dozen species to identify the key genes for the molecular production of the mucilage. \u201cPeople have been trying to characterize that mucilage chemically for 20 years and haven\u2019t come up with much information,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cTaking a transcriptome approach, I can generate a lot of data very quickly and tackle the issue not at the end results\u2014which is the sugar that is secreted\u2014but at the very beginning, at the point of the molecular machinery that assembled and allowed for the secretion of that sugar in the first place.\u201d Four of the taxa they sequenced produce visible mucilage, and the other three taxa do not, but are closely related to the mucilage producers. They believe that closely related diatoms should share similar transcriptomes, except for the mucilage-related genes. There are hundreds of genes involved in the assembly, packaging and secretion of these products, Ashworth said. If he can find 10 genes that are definitively involved in this process, then he is 10 genes closer to understanding how this function occurs. \u201cGenerating DNA sequences in itself isn\u2019t particularly exciting, but the way the sequences fit together, or the existence of certain sequences at all, tells us a lot about the biology of these organisms.\u201d Protist Central Theriot uses TACC to host a web portal that supports the research in the lab, called Protist Central . He and his team use the portal to manage images and information about all the diatoms that they\u2019re working on. They also use it to manage information from their collaboration with researchers in Guam on the diatom flora of the coral reefs of the Pacific.

We construct asymptotically good codes that can be deterministically encoded in almost linear time and sub-linear space, as well as asymptotically good codes that can be deterministically decoded in this complexity. The encodable codes are based on condenser graphs. The decodable codes are based on locally correctable codes and a new efficient derandomization method. We\u00a0believe that the new\u00a0derandomization method is of independent interest. The talk is based on joint works with Joshua\u00a0Cook. Jeremy Fineman, Georgetown University Beating Bellman-Ford: Faster Single-Source Shortest Paths with Negative Real Weights This talk presents a new randomized algorithm for the problem of single-source shortest path on directed graphs with real (both positive and negative) edge weights. Given an input graph with n vertices and m edges, the algorithm completes in $\\tilde{O}(mn^{8/9})$ time with high probability. Whereas there has been significant progress for the case of integer-weighted graphs, this result constitutes the first asymptotic improvement over the classic O(mn)-time algorithm for the case of real weights. Maryam Aliakbarpour, Rice University Hypothesis selection with computational constraints With the ever-growing volume of data, understanding the computational aspects of statistical inference is increasingly critical. A key question arises: Can we develop algorithms that are both fast and memory-efficient to tackle these challenges? In this talk, we focus on the computational aspects of Hypothesis Selection, a fundamental problem in learning theory and statistics. The task is to select a distribution from a finite set of candidate distributions that best matches the underlying distribution of the given dataset. This talk will delve into the hypothesis selection problem under constraints of memory and time. We will explore how to achieve a nearly optimal tradeoff between memory usage and sample complexity, as well as methods to attain optimal accuracy using algorithms with near-optimal time complexity. This talk is based on joint work with Mark Bun and Adam Smith. Barna Saha, UC San Diego Faster All Pairs Shortest Paths We consider the age-old all pairs shortest path problem. For graphs with n vertices, the all-pairs shortest paths conjecture states that there is no algorithm that is truly subcubic. We show how approximations (both multiplicative and additive) allow us to go way below the cubic bound beating the previous results. Joint work with Christopher Ye. \u0003 IFML at 12:15pm, GDC 6.302 Noah Golowich, MIT Computationally Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Linear Bellman Completeness One of the most natural approaches to reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation is value iteration, which inductively generates approximations to the optimal value function by solving a sequence of regression problems. To ensure the success of value iteration, it is typically assumed that Bellman completeness holds, which ensures that these regression problems are well-specified. I will discuss new results on the problem of learning an optimal policy under Bellman completeness in the online and offline models of RL with linear function approximation. In the online setting, while statistically efficient algorithms are known under Bellman completeness, these algorithms all relied on the principle of global optimism which requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem. We give the first polynomial-time algorithm when the number of actions is any constant. In the offline setting, we give the first algorithm which finds a near-optimal policy under a single-policy coverage condition. Our algorithm is also computationally efficient and generalizes to the setting with small inherent Bellman error, for which the suboptimality of our output policy scales with the square root of the Bellman error. We also prove a matching lower bound, showing that no algorithm can achieve better than square-root dependence on the Bellman error. This lower bound stands in contrast to many other settings in reinforcement learning with misspecification, where one can typically obtain performance that degrades linearly with the misspecification error. https://www.ifml.institute/index.php/events/computationally-efficient-reinforcement-learning-linear-bellman-completeness Venkatesan Guruswami, UC Berkeley The Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis The Parameterized\u00a0Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH) asserts that no fixed parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm can distinguish a satisfiable instance of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) parameterized by the number of variables, from one where every assignment fails to satisfy 1% of the constraints. PIH plays the role of the PCP theorem in parameterized complexity, with many downstream inapproximability consequences. This talk will introduce the context and statement of the PIH, and then sketch the ideas behind a recent proof showing that the well-known Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) implies the PIH.\u00a0 The approach involves two broad steps. The first identifies a highly structured ETH-hard CSP whose variables take vector values, and whose constraints are either parallel or linear. Both kinds of constraints are then checked with constant soundness via a \"parallel PCP of proximity\" based on the Hadamard code. We will briefly mention follow-up improvements that employ Reed-Muller code based PCPs to even get near-optimal runtime lower bounds, eg. showing that constant factor approximations to k-clique on n-vertex graphs requires n^{k^{1-o(1)}} time under ETH. Based on joint works with Bingkai Lin, Xuandi Ren, Yican Sun, and Kewen Wu. Kuikui Liu, MIT Strong spatial mixing for colorings on trees and its algorithmic applications Correlation decay is a fundamental and important property of distributions arising in statistical physics and theoretical computer science. A longstanding conjecture is that the uniform distribution over proper q-colorings on any tree of maximum degree\u00a0\u0394\u00a0exhibits a strong form of correlation decay whenever q\u2265\u0394+1. It is surprising that such a basic question is still open, but then again it also highlights how much we still have to learn about random colorings. In this talk, I will discuss a near-resolution of this conjecture, as well as its algorithmic implications for sampling colorings on bounded-degree graphs via Glauber dynamics. Based on joint work with Zongchen Chen, Nitya Mani, and Ankur Moitra. Nick Hunter-Jones, University of Texas at Austin Random unitaries in low depths We discuss recent progress in low-depth implementations of approximate unitary designs. A central question in quantum information theory is how efficiently can we construct unitaries which look indistinguishable from uniformly (Haar) random unitaries, mimicking moments of the Haar distribution. Through a combination of ideas from QI, TCS, and mathematical physics, it is now understood that such unitaries can be implemented in almost optimal depth. This has direct bearing on conjectures about circuit complexity growth and the incompressibility of quantum circuits. Sabee Grewal, University of Texas at Austin Improved Stabilizer Estimation via Bell Difference Sampling Stabilizer states, which are the outputs of Clifford circuits, play a central role in quantum information. Aaronson and Gottesman (2008) and Montanaro (2017) showed that n-qubit stabilizer states can be learned in poly(n) time. In this talk, I'll discuss joint work with Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, and Daniel Liang, where we establish new learnability and non-pseudorandomness results for outputs of Clifford+T circuits and generalizations thereof. Siddhartha Jain, University of Texas at Austin On Pigeonhole Principles and Ramsey in TFNP A celebrated theorem of Frank Ramsey says that in any undirected, simple graph on 2^n vertices, there must exist a clique or independent set of size n/2. RAMSEY is the search problem of finding such a clique or independent set given a succinctly represented graph as input. Similarly, PIGEON is the search problem corresponding to the Pigeonhole Principle. We\u00a0show that RAMSEY is not black-box reducible to PIGEON, refuting a conjecture of Goldberg and Papadimitriou in the black-box setting. We prove this by giving reductions to RAMSEY from a new family of TFNP problems that correspond to generalized versions of the pigeonhole principle, and then proving that these generalized versions cannot be reduced to PIGEON. Formally, we define t-PPP as the class of total NP-search problems reducible to finding a t-collision in a mapping from (t-1)N+1 pigeons to N holes. These classes are closely related to multi-collision resistant hash functions in cryptography. We show that the generalized pigeonhole classes form a hierarchy as t increases, and also give a natural condition on the parameters t1, t2 that captures exactly when t1-PPP and t2-PPP collapse in the black-box setting. Finally, we prove other inclusion and separation results between these generalized PIGEON problems and other previously studied TFNP subclasses, such as PLS, PPA and PLC. Our separation results rely on new lower bounds in propositional proof complexity based on pseudoexpectation operators, which may be of independent interest. Cristopher Moore, Santa Fe Institute Tensor networks and phase transitions in machine learning Suppose we observe a matrix of data with a low-rank \u201csignal\u201d obscured by noise. The standard way to find the signal, at least approximately, is PCA (principal component analysis): just look at the eigenvectors of the matrix. For Gaussian noise, random matrix theory tells us exactly how well this works: that is, the accuracy we can achieve as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. For tensors, such as three-index tables A_ijk, the situation is much more complex. Here there seems to be a \u201cstatistical-computational gap,\u201d namely a regime where finding the signal is possible but exponentially hard. Physically, this corresponds to a \u201cglass transition,\u201d where the optimum becomes hidden behind an energy barrier. Mathematically, it means that we believe no polynomial-time algorithm exists, and that something like exhaustive search is necessary. I\u2019ll give evidence for this exponential hardness by showing that no algorithm remotely similar to PCA can work: more precisely, no low-degree polynomial of the input can. Along the way, I\u2019ll give an introduction to tensor networks \u2014 a generalization of matrix products and traces that everyone, including network theorists, should know about. If we\u2019re really lucky I\u2019ll mention free probability and free cumulants... This is joint work with Tim Kunisky (Yale) and Alex Wein (UC Davis) and appeared in FOCS 2024. Jesse Goodman, University of Texas at Austin Improved condensers for Chor-Goldreich sources One of the earliest models of weak randomness is the Chor-Goldreich (CG) source. A CG source is a sequence of correlated random variables X = (X1, \u2026, Xt), where each block Xi is guaranteed to have some entropy, even conditioned on the blocks that come before it. Unfortunately, it is impossible to extract uniformly random bits from CG sources. Surprisingly, however, a recent work of Doron, Moshkovitz, Oh, and Zuckerman (STOC \u201923) showed that it *is* possible to *condense* CG sources into a string with extremely high entropy rate \u2014 and this is good enough for many applications in algorithm design and cryptography. In their work, [DMOZ23] showed how to condense CG sources where each block Xi has *constant length*. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work that handles CG sources where each block Xi can be *arbitrarily long*. In order to construct our condensers, we take a well-known paradigm for condensing independent sources, and bring it into the correlated world of CG sources. Our key ingredient is a powerful new type of object, which we call a non-malleable condenser for CG sources. Joint work with Xin Li and David Zuckerman.

Over the last 20 years, clustering in data streams has received a tremendous amount of attention and has been the test-bed for a large variety of new techniques, including coresets, the merge-and-reduce framework, bicriteria approximation, sensitivity sampling, and so on. Despite this intense effort to obtain smaller sketches for these problems, all known techniques require storing at least Omega(log(nDelta)) words of memory, where\u00a0n\u00a0is the size of the input and Delta is the aspect ratio. A natural question is if one can beat this logarithmic dependence on\u00a0n\u00a0and Delta. In this paper, we break this barrier by giving the first algorithm that achieves a (1+epsilon)-approximation to the more general (k,z)-clustering problem, using only ~O(dk/varepsilon^2)*(2^{z\u00a0log\u00a0z})*min(1/epsilon^z, k)*poly(log\u00a0log(n\u00a0Delta)) words of memory. Joint work with Vincent Cohen-Addad and David P. Woodruff. 01/26/2024 Thomas Rothvoss , University of Washington The Subspace Flatness Conjecture and Faster Integer Programming In a seminal paper, Kannan and Lov\\'asz (1988) considered a quantity \u00a0$\\mu_{KL}(\\Lambda,K)$ which denotes the best volume-based lower bound on the \\emph{covering \u00a0radius} $\\mu(\\Lambda,K)$ of a convex body $K$ with respect to a lattice $\\Lambda$. Kannan and Lov\\'asz proved \u00a0that $\\mu(\\Lambda,K) \\leq n \\cdot \\mu_{KL}(\\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace \u00a0Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\\log n)$ factor \u00a0suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\\'asz. We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that\u00a0 $\\mu(\\Lambda,K) \\leq O(\\log^{3}(n)) \\cdot \\mu_{KL} (\\Lambda,K)$. \u00a0Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a $(\\log \u00a0n)^{O(n)}$-time randomized algorithm to solve integer programs in $n$ variables. Another implication of our main result is a near-optimal \\emph{flatness \u00a0constant} of $O(n \\log^{3}(n))$. This is joint work with Victor Reis. 02/02/2024\u200b Brent Waters , University\u00a0of Texas Adaptively-Sound Succinct Arguments for NP from Indistinguishability Obfuscation A succinct non-interactive argument (SNARG) for NP allows a prover to convince a verifier that an NP statement x is true with a proof of size o(|x| + |w|) where w is the associated NP witness. A SNARG satisfies adaptive soundness if the malicious prover can choose the statement to prove after seeing the scheme parameters. In this work, we provide the first adaptively-sound SNARG for NP in the plain model assuming sub-exponentially-hard indistinguishability obfuscation, sub-exponentially-hard one-way functions and either the (polynomial) hardness of the discrete log assumption or the (polynomial) hardness of factoring. This gives the first adaptively-sound SNARG for NP from falsifiable} assumptions. All previous SNARGs for in the plain model either relied on non-falsifiable cryptographic assumptions or satisfied a weak notion of non-adaptive soundness (where the adversary has to choose the statement it proves before seeing the scheme parameters). This is joint work with David Wu. 02/09/2024 Gregory Kehne , University of Texas Online Covering: Secretaries, Prophets, and Samples What makes set cover harder to solve online than off? By way of an answer, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for online covering integer programs (IPs) with a competitive ratio of O(\\log mn) when the constraints are revealed in random order, essentially matching the best possible offline bound of \\Omega(\\log n) and circumventing the \\Omega(\\log m \\log n) lower bound known in adversarial order. We then leverage this O(\\log mn) competitive algorithm for the prophet version of online integer covering, where constraints are sampled from a sequence of known distributions. We present sample guarantees in the prophet setting, as well as in the setting where random samples from an adversarial instance are revealed at the outset. This talk is based on joint work with Anupam Gupta and Roie Levin. 02/23/2024 Parikshit Gopalan , Apple Omniprediction and multigroup fairness Consider a scenario where we are learning a predictor, whose predictions will be evaluated by their expected loss. What if we do not know the precise loss at the time of learning,\u00a0beyond some generic properties (like convexity)? What if the same predictor will be used in several applications in the future, each with their own loss function? Can we still learn predictors that have strong guarantees? This motivates the notion of omnipredictors: predictors with strong loss minimization guarantees across a broad family of loss functions,\u00a0relative to a benchmark hypothesis class. Omniprediction turns out to be intimately connected to multigroup fairness notions such as multicalibration, and also to other topics like boosting, swap regret minimization, and the approximate rank of matrices. This talk will present recent work in this area,\u00a0emphasizing these connections. 03/01/2024 Ainesh Bakshi , MIT Learning quantum Hamiltonians at any temperature in polynomial time A quantum system of n interacting particles at thermal equilibrium can be described using a polynomial number of parameters, which correspond to the strengths of the forces between particles. A natural open question has been whether these parameters can be estimated efficiently by running experiments on the system. We resolve this question by giving the first polynomial-time algorithm for this task. This improves over prior work, which uses polynomially many samples from the system, but requires exponential time. In this talk, I will introduce the problem and describe some of the key ideas behind our algorithm. No background in quantum information is required. Based on joint work with Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra and Ewin Tang. 03/08/2024 Josh Alman , Columbia University Faster Walsh-Hadamard Transform from Matrix Non-Rigidity The Walsh-Hadamard transform is a simple recursively-defined linear transformation with many applications throughout algorithm design and complexity theory. The folklore \"fast Walsh-Hadamard transform\" algorithm computes it using only N log N arithmetic operations, which is believed to be optimal up to constant factors. In this talk, I'll give two improved constructions: - A new algorithm which uses (23/24) N log N\u00a0+ O(N)\u00a0arithmetic operations. This is, to my knowledge, the first improvement of the leading constant. (Based on joint work with Kevin Rao.) - A new depth-2 linear circuit of size O(N^1.45), improving on size O(N^1.5)\u00a0which one gets from the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform approach. (Based on joint work with Ashwin Padaki and Yunfeng Guan.) A key idea behind both constructions is to take advantage of the matrix non-rigidty of the Walsh-Hadamard transform. A matrix is called \"rigid\" if it's impossible to change a \"small\" number of its entries to make it have \"low\" rank. L. Valiant showed that if a matrix is rigid, then this implies lower bounds for computing its linear transformation. However, a recent line of work has shown that many matrices of interest, including the Walsh-Hadamard transform, are actually not rigid. Although a formal converse to Valiant's result is not known, we'll make use of non-rigidity in our new constructions. 03/22/2024 Ce Jin , MIT 0-1 Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental 0-1 Knapsack problem. Recent research interest has focused on its fine-grained complexity with respect to the number of items n and the maximum item weight w_max. Under (min,+)-convolution hypothesis, 0-1 Knapsack does not have O((n+w_max)^{2-\u03b4}) time algorithms (Cygan-Mucha-W\u0119grzycki-W\u0142odarczyk 2017 and K\u00fcnnemann-Paturi-Schneider 2017). On the upper bound side, currently the fastest algorithm runs in O~(n + w_max^{12/5}) time (Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang 2023), improving the earlier O(n + w_max^3)-time algorithm by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\u0119grzycki (2021). We close this gap between the upper bound and the conditional lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors): The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in O(n + w_max^2 * log^4 w_max) time. 03/29/2024 Ryan Williams , MIT Beating Brute Force for Compression Problems A compression problem is defined with respect to an efficient encoding function f: given a string x, the goal is to find the shortest y such that f(y)=x. The obvious brute-force algorithm for solving a compression problem on n-bit strings runs in time about 2^s, where s is the length of the shortest description y. We show that every compression problem has a Boolean circuit family which finds short descriptions more efficiently than brute force. In particular, our circuits have size roughly 2^{4s/5}. Our construction builds on Fiat-Naor\u2019s data structure for function inversion [SICOMP 1999]: we show how to carefully modify their data structure so that it can be nontrivially implemented using Boolean circuits, and we show how to utilize hashing so that the circuit size is only exponential in the description length. One corollary is that the Minimum Circuit Size Problem for generic fan-in two circuits of size s(n) on truth tables of size 2^n can be solved by circuits of size 2^{4/5 w + o(w)}poly(2^n), where w=s(n)log_2(s(n)+n). This improves over the brute-force approach of trying all possible size-s(n) circuits for all s(n) >= n. This talk is based on joint work with Shuichi Hirahara and Rahul Ilango, which will be merged with concurrent and independent work of Noam Mazor and Rafael Pass. 04/05/2024 Moses Charikar , Stanford Breaking the\u00a0Metric\u00a0Voting\u00a0Distortion\u00a0Barrier We consider the following well-studied problem of\u00a0metric\u00a0distortion\u00a0in social choice. Suppose we have an election with voters and candidates who lie in a shared\u00a0metric\u00a0space. We would like to design a voting rule that chooses a candidate whose average distance to the voters is small. However, instead of having direct access to the distances in the\u00a0metric\u00a0space, each voter gives us a ranked list of the candidates in order of distance. Can we design a voting rule that, regardless of the election instance and underlying\u00a0metric\u00a0space, chooses a candidate whose cost differs from the true optimum by only a small factor (known as the\u00a0distortion)? A long line of work culminated in finding deterministic voting rules with\u00a0metric\u00a0distortion\u00a03, which is the best possible for deterministic rules and many other classes of voting rules. However, without any restrictions, there is still a significant gap in our understanding. Even though the best lower bound is substantially lower at 2.112, finding a randomized rule that guarantees\u00a0distortion\u00a0$3 - \\epsilon$ for some constant $\\epsilon$ has been a major challenge in computational social choice. In this work, we give a rule that guarantees\u00a0distortion\u00a0less than 2.753 by carefully randomizing between Maximal Lotteries, a natural game-theoretical voting rule dating back to the 60's, and new voting rules that we introduce. Based on joint work with Prasanna Ramakrishnan, Kangning Wang, and Hongxun Wu. 04/12/2024 Amit Sahai The Mathematics of Hiding Secrets in Software At least since the initial public proposal of public-key cryptography based on computational hardness conjectures (Diffie and Hellman, 1976), cryptographers have contemplated the possibility of a \u201cone-way compiler\u201d that translates computer programs into \u201cincomprehensible\u201d but equivalent forms. And yet, the search for such a \u201cone-way compiler\u201d remained elusive for decades. In this talk, we look back at our community\u2019s attempts to formalize the notion of such a compiler, culminating in our 2001 work with Barak, Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Vadhan, and Yang, which proposed the notion of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Roughly speaking, iO requires that the compiled versions of any two equivalent programs (with the same size and running time) be indistinguishable to any efficient adversary. The notion of punctured programming, introduced in our work with Waters in 2013, spawned an area of research dedicated to exploring the remarkable power of iO. We\u2019ll then discuss the intense effort that recently culminated in our 2021 work with Jain and Lin, finally showing how to construct iO in such a way that, for the first time, we can prove the security of our iO scheme based on well-studied computational hardness conjectures in cryptography. 04/19/2024 Euiwoong Lee , University of Michigan Recent Progresses on Correlation Clustering Correlation Clustering is one of the most well-studied graph clustering problems. The input is a complete graph where each edge is labeled either \"+\" or \"-\", and the goal is to partition the vertex set into (an arbitrary number of) clusters to minimize (the number of + edges between different clusters) + (the number of - edges within the same cluster). Until recently, the best polynomial-time approximation ratio was 2.06, nearly matching the integrality gap of 2 for the standard LP relaxation. Since 2022, we have bypassed this barrier and progressively improved the approximation ratio, with the current ratio being 1.44. Based on a new relaxation inspired by the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, the algorithm introduces and combines several tools considered in different contexts, including \"local to global correlation rounding\" and \"combinatorial preclusering\". In this talk, I will describe the current algorithm as well as how it has been inspired by various viewpoints. Joint work with Nairen Cao, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Shi Li, Alantha Newman, and Lukas Vogl. 04/26/2024 Yufei Zhao , MIT Equiangular lines and eigenvalue multiplicity I will discuss our solution to a longstanding discrete geometry problem where we determined the maximum number of lines in high dimension pairwise separated by a fixed angle. A key step is a new result in spectral graph theory showing that a connected bounded degree graph has sublinear second eigenvalue multiplicity. These results prompted further investigations into spherical codes and spectral graph theory. I will highlight some ongoing work and open problems. 05/03/2024 Mohsen Ghaffari Parallel Derandomization for Chernoff-like Concentrations Randomized algorithms frequently use concentration results such as Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. A longstanding challenge in parallel computing is to devise an efficient method to derandomize parallel algorithms that rely on such concentrations.\u00a0Classic works of Motwani, Naor, and Naor [FOCS'89] and Berger and Rompel [FOCS'89] provide an elegant parallel derandomization method for these, via a binary search in a k-wise independent space, but with one major disadvantage: it blows up the computational work by a (large) polynomial. That is, the resulting deterministic parallel algorithm is far from\u00a0work-efficiency and needs polynomial processors even to match the speed of single-processor computation. This talk overviews a duo of recent papers that provide the first nearly work-efficient parallel derandomization method for Chernoff-like concentrations.

One of the most important and well studied types of extractors is the so-called two source extractor, where the input consists of two independent weak sources. Assuming each source has n bits, one can show the existence of two source extractors for entropy k =log n+O(1). Such an extractor also gives a (bipartite) Ramsey graph with N=2^n vertices (on each side), such that there is no (bipartite) clique or independent set of size K=O(log N). Explicit constructions of two source extractors and Ramsey graphs are long standing open problems, dating back to the year of 1947 when Erd\u02ddos invented the probabilistic method. However, despite considerable effort and several recent breakthroughs, previously the best explicit two source extractor only works for entropy k=o(log n log log n). Correspondingly, the best explicit construction of Ramsey graphs only guarantees the non-existence of a clique or independent set of size K=(log N)^{o(log log log N)}. In this talk, I will describe a new construction of explicit two source extractors for asymptotically optimal entropy of k=O(log n), which gives explicit Ramsey graphs on N vertices with on clique or independent set of size K=log^c N for some absolute constant c>1. 08/25/2023 Geoffrey Mon , UT Austin Relaxed Local Correctability from Local Testing A relaxed locally correctable code is equipped with an algorithm that, when given query access to a (potentially corrupted) codeword and an index i, either returns the ith bit of the nearest codeword or detects corruption. We build the first asymptotically good relaxed locally correctable codes with polylogarithmic query complexity, which finally closes the superpolynomial gap between query lower and upper bounds. Our construction makes use of locally testable codes, which have algorithms that probabilistically detect the presence of corruption with few queries. By combining high-rate locally testable codes of various sizes, we can produce a code with local testers at every scale: we can gradually \"zoom in\" to any desired codeword index i, and a local tester at each step certifies that the next, smaller restriction of the input has low error. If no local tester detects corruption throughout this process, then the ith bit of the input is likely not corrupt and can be safely returned. Based on joint work with Vinayak M. Kumar. 09/01/2023 Kevin Tian , UT Austin Linear-Sized Sparsifiers via Near-Linear Time Discrepancy Theory Discrepancy theory provides powerful tools for producing higher-quality objects which \u201cbeat the union bound\u201d in fundamental settings throughout combinatorics and computer science. However, this quality has often come at the price of more expensive algorithms. We introduce a new framework for bridging this gap, by allowing for the efficient implementation of discrepancy-theoretic primitives. Our framework repeatedly solves regularized optimization problems to low accuracy to approximate the partial coloring method of [Rothvoss \u201917], and simplifies and generalizes recent work of [Jain-Sah-Sawhney \u201923] on fast algorithms for Spencer\u2019s theorem. In particular, our framework only requires that the discrepancy body of interest has exponentially large Gaussian measure and is expressible as a sub level set of a symmetric, convex function. We combine this framework with new tools for proving Gaussian measure lower bounds to give improved algorithms for a variety of sparsification and coloring problems. Joint work with Arun Jambulapati and Victor Reis. 09/08/2023 Raghu Meka , UCLA Resolving Matrix Spencer Conjecture Up to poly-logarithmic Rank The matrix Spencer conjecture is the following: given n symmetric matrices A1,..., An each of spectral norm at most 1, can we find signs for each of them such that their signed sum has spectral-norm at most O(sqrt{n}). If true, this would substantially generalize Spencer's 'Six standard deviations suffice' (a classical result in discrepancy theory). Spencer's result corresponds to the matrices Ai being diagonal. In this talk, I will describe a simple proof of the matrix Spencer conjecture up to poly-logarithmic rank, i.e., each matrix Ai has rank at most n/(log n)^3. Previously, the result was known only for rank sqrt(n). Our result also has implications for quantum random access codes in the low-error regime: in particular, it implies a (1*log n - 3*(log log n)) lower bound for quantum random access codes with an advantage of 1/sqrt(n). Based on joint work with Nikhil Bansal and Haotian Jiang. 09/15/2023 Scott Aaronson , UT Austin / Open AI Watermarking of Large Language Models I'll survey the research that's been done over the last year, by me and others, into the problem of how to insert statistical watermarks into the outputs of Large Language Models,\u00a0in order (for example) to help detect GPT-enabled academic cheating,\u00a0propaganda campaigns, and fraud.\u00a0 I'll explain how, by using pseudorandom functions, one can typically insert a watermark without degrading the quality of the LLM's\u00a0output at all.\u00a0 I'll highlight the theoretical computer science aspects of the problem, as well as the challenge of coming up with a watermarking scheme that resists rephrasing attacks,\u00a0or even of formalizing what one means by that.\u00a0 I'll also discuss some of the social and political issues around the deployment of LLM watermarking. 09/22/2023 Peter Manohar ,\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University Lower Bounds for Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation A code C is a q-locally decodable code (q-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit b_i of the k-bit message b with good confidence by randomly querying the n-bit encoding x on at most q coordinates. Existing constructions of 2-LDCs achieve blocklength n = exp(O(k)), and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when q = 3, far less is known: the best constructions have n = subexp(k), while the best known lower bounds, that have stood for nearly two decades, only show a quadratic lower bound of n >= \\Omega(k^2) on the blocklength. In this talk, we will showcase a new approach to prove lower bounds for LDCs using recent advances in refuting semirandom instances of constraint satisfaction problems. These new tools yield, in the 3-query case, a near-cubic lower bound of n >= \\tilde{\\Omega}(k^3), improving on the prior best lower bound of n >= \\tilde{\\Omega(k^2)} of Kerendis and de Wolf from 2004 by a polynomial factor in k. 10/06/2023 Ali Vakilian , TTIC Algorithms for Socially Fair Clustering: Min-Max Fairness to Cascaded Norms In the center-based clustering methods (e.g., k-means), the assignment cost of a point represents the quality of the clustering for the point. This has motivated a notion of min-max fairness for the clustering problem, also known as socially fair clustering: Select k centers that minimize the maximum average clustering cost incurred by any of the L pre-specified groups of points in the input. This problem can be used to select a set of vaccination or polling sites to ensure different communities in the population are served fairly. In this talk, I present our O(log L/ log log L)-approximation for the problem, which exponentially improves over the previously known O(L)-approximation and is optimal up to a constant factor. Then, I introduce a generalization of the problem called (p, q)-fair clustering, i.e., clustering with cascaded norms. This is a \u201crelaxed\u201d way of enforcing the fairness requirement, and its objective interpolates between the objective of classic k-clustering and that of socially fair clustering. 10/13/2023 Keegan Ryan,\u00a0USCD Fast Practical Lattice Reduction through Iterated Compression We introduce a new lattice basis reduction algorithm with approximation guarantees analogous to the LLL algorithm and practical performance that far exceeds the current state of the art. We achieve these results by iteratively applying precision management techniques within a recursive algorithm structure and show the stability of this approach. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of our algorithm for arbitrary basis matrices, and we show that the heuristic running time is small and comparable to the cost of performing size reduction, matrix multiplication, and QR factorization on similarly sized matrices. The heuristic running time of our algorithm depends on the log of the condition number of the input basis, which is bounded by the bit length of basis entries in common applications. Our algorithm is fully practical, and we have published our implementation. We experimentally validate our heuristic, give extensive benchmarks against numerous classes of cryptographic lattices, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing implementations. 10/20/23 Aaron Potechin , University of Chicago Separating MAX 2-AND, MAX DI-CUT and MAX CUT In 2008, Raghavendra's paper \"Optimal algorithms and inapproximability results for every CSP?\" showed that assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (or at least that unique games is hard), for any CSP on a finite set of predicates, the optimal worst-case polynomial time approximation algorithm is to use a standard semidefinite program and then apply a rounding algorithm. However, since the set of potential rounding functions is extremely large, Raghavendra's result does not tell us what the approximation ratio is for a given CSP. In fact, there are still several basic questions which are still open. For example, the question of whether there is a 7/8 approximation ratio for MAX SAT (where the clauses can have any length) is still open. In this talk, I will review Raghavendra's result and why additional work is needed to analyze particular CSPs. I will then describe why MAX 2-AND, MAX DI-CUT and MAX CUT all have different approximation ratios and how we can prove this. This is joint work with Joshua Brakensiek, Neng Huang, and Uri Zwick 10/27/23 Lijie Chen , UC Berkeley Polynomial -Time Pseudodeterministic Construction of Primes A randomized algorithm for a search problem is pseudodeterministic if it produces a fixed canonical solution to the search problem with high probability. In their seminal work on the topic, Gat and Goldwasser posed as their main open problem whether prime numbers can be pseudodeterministically constructed in polynomial time. We provide a positive solution to this question in the infinitely-often regime. In more detail, we give an unconditional polynomial-time randomized algorithm B such that, for infinitely many values of n, B(1^n) outputs a canonical n-bit prime p_n with high probability. More generally, we prove that for every dense property Q of strings that can be decided in polynomial time, there is an infinitely-often pseudodeterministic polynomial-time construction of strings satisfying Q. This improves upon a subexponential-time construction of Oliveira and Santhanam. Our construction uses several new ideas, including a novel bootstrapping technique for pseudodeterministic constructions, and a quantitative optimization of the uniform hardness-randomness framework of Chen and Tell, using a variant of the Shaltiel-Umans generator. This talk is based on joint work with Zhenjian Lu, Igor C. Oliveira, Hanlin Ren, and Rahul Santhanam. 11/03/2023 Jesse Goodman ,\u00a0UT Austin Exponentially Improved Extractors for Adversarial Sources Randomness is a powerful resource in computer science, with applications in cryptography, distributed computing, algorithm design, and more. Unfortunately, almost all of these applications require access to perfectly uniform bits, while the bits available in nature rarely look so pure. This motivates the study of randomness extractors, which are devices that can convert weak sources of randomness into perfectly uniform bits. The *independent source model* is the oldest and most well-studied setting in which to study randomness extraction. In this model, the goal is to extract uniform bits from a sequence of N independent random variables X1, \u2026, XN, each with min-entropy at least k. However, in real life, natural sources of randomness may sometimes produce samples with no entropy at all. This motivates the study of *adversarial sources*, which are identical to independent sources, except that only K of them are guaranteed to be \u201cgood\u201d (i.e., contain any min-entropy, k). Adversarial sources were first introduced by Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal and Li (STOC \u201820), who showed how to extract from just K \u2265 N^{0.5} good sources of polylogarithmic entropy. In a follow-up work, Chattopadhyay and Goodman (FOCS \u201821) improved the number of required good sources to K \u2265 N^{0.01}. In this talk, I will describe a new construction that works for *exponentially less* good sources K \u2265 polylog(N). In fact, for any constant N (e.g., N = 10^82), our extractor requires just K = 4 of the sources to be good. To construct our extractors, we exploit old and new tools from communication complexity, extractor theory, and extremal combinatorics. Based on joint work with Eshan Chattopadhyay. 11/10/2023 Greg Bodwin , University of Michigan Recent Progress on Fault Tolerant Spanners Given a large input graph, a k-spanner is a much smaller subgraph that preserves shortest path distances up to an approximation factor of k. When this distance approximation is robust to a bounded set of failing nodes or edges, the spanner is called fault tolerant.\u00a0 Fault tolerant spanners and their relatives have applications in networking and distributed computing. There has been a recent flurry of progress in our understanding of fault tolerant spanners, including faster construction algorithms and better tradeoffs between spanner size, error, and level of fault tolerance. We will survey this progress, spanning a sequence of 8 papers over the last 5 years. We will explain the new perspectives on the problem that have enabled progress, what has been solved, and what remains open. 11/17/2023 Thatchaphol Saranurak , University of Michigan Using Isolating Mincuts for Fast Graph Algorithms: A Tutorial The Isolating Mincuts algorithm is a new technique recently introduced by [Li and Panigrahi] and [Abboud Krauthgamer Trabelsi]. In the last three years, they found more than ten applications in fast graph algorithms. I will give a gentle tutorial on this technique. 12/01/2023 Sivakanth\u00a0Gopi , Microsoft Research Higher Order MDS Codes and List Decoding In this talk, we introduce 'higher order MDS codes', a fundamental generalization of MDS codes. An order-m MDS code, denoted by MDS(m), has the property that any m subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. Ordinary MDS codes correspond to m=2. We will then show that higher order MDS codes are equivalent to various seemingly unrelated concepts in coding theory: (1) optimally list-decodable codes (2) maximally recoverable tensor codes and (3) MDS codes with support constrained generator matrices (such as in GM-MDS theorem). This along with the GM-MDS theorem for Reed-Solomon codes implies that random Reed-Solomon codes over large enough alphabet are optimally list decodable. This closes a long line of work on list-decodability of Reed-Solomon codes starting with the celebrated result of Guruswami and Sudan (1998) who showed that they are list-decodable up to the Johnson bound. Later works showed that \"random\" Reed-Solomon codes are list-decodable beyond the Johnson bound. We show that they in fact are optimally list-decodable! Quantitatively, we show that a random Reed-Solomon code of rate R over a large enough field is list decodable from radius 1-R-(1-R)/(L+1) with list size at most L, which proves a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo (2020). Subsequent work by Guo, Zhang (2023) and Alrabiah, Guruswami and Li (2023) showed that random RS codes over linear-sized fields achieve list-decoding capacity (which is weaker than optimal list-decoding). Building on this, we show that random AG codes over constant-sized fields achieve list-decoding capacity. For this, we prove a generalized GM-MDS theorem for algebraic codes. Based on joint work with Joshua Brakensiek, Manik Dhar, Visu Makam and Zihan Zhang. 12/8/2023 Jinyoung Park , Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences NYU Thresholds For a finite set X, a family F of subsets of X is said to be increasing if any set A that contains B in F is also in F. The p-biased product measure of F increases as p increases from 0 to 1, and often exhibits a drastic change around a specific value, which is called a \"threshold.\" Thresholds of increasing families have been of great historical interest and a central focus of the study of random discrete structures (e.g. random graphs and hypergraphs), with estimation of thresholds for specific properties the subject of some of the most challenging work in the area. In 2006, Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai conjectured that a natural (and often easy to calculate) lower bound q(F) (which we refer to as the \u201cexpectation-threshold\u201d) for the threshold is in fact never far from its actual value. A positive answer to this conjecture enables one to narrow down the location of thresholds for any increasing properties in a tiny window. In particular, this easily implies several previously very difficult results in probabilistic combinatorics such as thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings (Johansson\u2013Kahn\u2013Vu) and bounded-degree spanning trees (Montgomery). I will present recent progress on this topic. Based on joint work with Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Huy Tuan Pham.

This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the\u00a0bulk\u00a0in linear time. Moreover, the\u00a0bulk\u00a0graph is planar, it has O(N^2)\u00a0vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it's ``universal,'' with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an ``inverse'' of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and we need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries -- where the boundaries could be connected wormholes -- including an upper bound of O(N^4)\u00a0vertices whenever a planar\u00a0bulk\u00a0graph exists, thus putting the problem into NP. The talk is meant to be accessible to a CS theory audience, and assumes no particular knowledge of quantum gravity or even quantum mechanics. Joint work with Jason Pollack (UT Austin) https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601 01/20/2023 Robert Andrews , University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign On Matrix Multiplication and Polynomial Identity Testing Determining the complexity of matrix multiplication is a fundamental problem of theoretical computer science. It is popularly conjectured that \u03c9, the matrix multiplication exponent, equals 2. If true, this conjecture would yield fast algorithms for a wide array of problems in linear algebra and beyond. If instead \u03c9 > 2, can the hardness of matrix multiplication be leveraged to design algorithms for other problems? In this talk, I will describe how lower bounds on \u03c9 can be used to make progress on derandomizing polynomial identity testing. 01/27/2023 William Kretschmer , UT Quantum Cryptography in Algorithmica In this talk, I will discuss the construction of a classical oracle relative to which P = NP yet single-copy secure pseudorandom quantum states exist. In the language of Impagliazzo's five worlds, this is a construction of pseudorandom states in \"Algorithmica,\" and hence shows that in a black-box setting, quantum cryptography based on pseudorandom states is possible even if one-way functions do not exist. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists a property of a cryptographic hash function that simultaneously (1) suffices to construct pseudorandom quantum states, (2) holds for a random oracle, and thus plausibly holds for existing hash functions like SHA3, and (3) is independent of the P vs. NP question in the black box setting. This offers further evidence that one-way functions are not necessary for computationally-secure quantum cryptography. Our proof builds on recent work of Aaronson, Ingram, and Kretschmer (2022).

Specifically, we construct a deterministic condenser that on input a Shannon-CG source, outputs a distribution that is close to having constant entropy gap, namely its min-entropy is only an additive constant less than its length.\u00a0 Therefore, we can simulate any randomized algorithm with small failure probability using almost CG sources with no multiplicative slowdown. This result extends to randomized protocols as well, and any setting in which we cannot simply cycle over all seeds, and a \"one-shot\" simulation is needed.\u00a0 Moreover, our construction works in an online manner, since it is based on random walks on expanders. Our main technical contribution is a novel analysis of random walks, which should be of independent interest. We analyze walks with adversarially correlated steps, each step being entropy-deficient, on good enough lossless expanders. We prove that such walks (or certain interleaved walks on two expanders) accumulate entropy.

A (binary) k-deletion code of length n is a set C of binary strings of length n capable of correcting k such errors, i.e. satisfying the property that no pair of elements of C shares a common subsequence of length at least n-k. Let D(n, k) be the size of the largest k-deletion code of length n. Two central problems are to determine (a) the order of D(n, k) for constant k, and (b) the supremum of all 0<p<1 such that D(n, pn) grows exponentially in n (the so-called \"zero-rate threshold\"). In this talk, we establish the first nontrivial lower bound for problem (a) when k > 1, improving the greedy lower bound for D(n,k) by a logarithmic factor. We also prove the first nontrivial upper bound for problem (b), showing that D(n,pn) = 2^o(n) for p > 1/2 - 10^{-60}. The proofs use a variety of techniques from extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, especially pseudorandomness and a regularity lemma.

First defined by Ji, Liu and Song, such states have found a number of applications ranging from cryptography to the AdS/CFT correspondence. A fundamental question is exactly how much entanglement is required to create such states. Haar-random states, as well as t-designs for t\u22652, exhibit near-maximal entanglement. Here we provide the first construction of pseudorandom states with only polylogarithmic entanglement entropy across an equipartition of the qubits, which is the minimum possible. Our construction can be based on any one-way function secure against quantum attack. We additionally show that the entanglement in our construction is fully \"tunable\", in the sense that one can have pseudorandom states with entanglement \u0398(f(n)) for any desired function \u03c9(logn)\u2264f(n)\u2264O(n). More fundamentally, our work calls into question to what extent entanglement is a \"feelable\" quantity of quantum systems. Inspired by recent work of Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define a new notion which we call \"pseudoentanglement\", which are ensembles of efficiently constructable quantum states which hide their entanglement entropy. We show such states exist in the strongest form possible while simultaneously being pseudorandom states. We also describe diverse applications of our result from entanglement distillation to property testing to quantum gravity. 03/03/2023 Robert Tarjan ,\u00a0Princeton University - James S.

While they have been shown to be extremely useful for cryptographic purposes, a natural question is \"what resources might be needed to construct them?\" We attempt to answer the question relative to the Clifford + T gate set, a commonly used universal quantum gate. As the name implies, the T gate is the most expensive operation in this set and the number of T gates needed to create a state is often the most important measure. Our results are as follows: Given blackbox access to an n-qubit quantum state that is promised to be either (1) a state prepared with Clifford gates and at most t uses of the T gate or (2) a Haar random state, we give an algorithm that distinguishes between the two cases with probability at least 1-delta using at most O(exp(t) log(1/delta)) samples and O(n exp(t) log(1/delta)) time. As such, the number of T gates necessary for the construction of pseudorandom quantum states is strictly greater than O(log n). Our proofs expand on recent results by Gross, Nezami, and Walter (2021).

First, I will show that CLWE is as hard as the widely studied (discrete) learning with errors (LWE) problem using techniques from leakage-resilient cryptography. In turn, I will use this to show the nearly optimal hardness of the long-studied Gaussian mixture learning problem. Secondly, I will show an application of CLWE to machine learning. In the increasingly common setting where the training of models is outsourced, I will describe a method whereby a malicious trainer can use cryptography to insert an *undetectable* backdoor in a classifier. Using a secret key, the trainer can then slightly alter inputs to create large deviations in the model output. Without the secret key, the existence of the backdoor is hidden.

In both cases, and many others, a third party wants to understand something in the aggregate about a large distributed database but under the constraint that each individual record requires some guarantee of privacy. Protocols satisfying so-called local differential privacy have become the gold standard for guaranteeing privacy in such situations, and in this talk I will discuss new such protocols for two of the most common problems that require solutions in this framework: frequency estimation, and mean estimation.

The SAT-solving approach is completely automatic and can produce clever though potentially gigantic proofs. We can have confidence in the correctness of the answers because highly trustworthy systems can validate the underlying proofs regardless of their size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAT approach by presenting some successes, including the solution of the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem, computing the fifth Schur number, and resolving the remaining case of Keller\u2019s conjecture. Moreover, we constructed and validated proofs for each of these results. The second part of the talk focuses on notorious math challenges for which automated reasoning may well be suitable. In particular, we discuss advances in applying SAT-solving techniques to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem (chromatic number of the plane), optimal schemes for matrix multiplication, and the Collatz conjecture.

In many high-dimensional optimization settings, there are significant gaps between the amount of data or number of iterations required by algorithms whose memory usage scales linearly with the dimension versus more complex and memory-intensive algorithms.\u00a0 Do some problems inherently require super-linear (or quadratic memory) to be solved efficiently? In this talk, we will survey the lay-of-the-land of fundamental tradeoffs between the amount of available memory, and the amount of data or queries to the function being optimized.\u00a0 This will include a discussion of our recent work showing that for optimizing a convex function, given the ability to query the function value/gradient at points, a (significantly) super-linear amount of memory is required to achieve the optimal rate of convergence obtained by algorithms using more than quadratic memory.\u00a0 Throughout, the emphasis will be on the many open problems in this area. 04/07/2023 Ruizhe Zhang , UT Austin Solving SDP Faster: A Robust IPM Framework and Efficient Implementation Semidefinite programming (SDP) is one of the most important tools in optimization theory. In this talk, I will introduce a new robust interior-point method analysis for SDP. Under this new framework, we can improve the running time of semidefinite programming (SDP) with variable size n\u00d7n and m constraints up to \u03f5 accuracy. For the case m=\u03a9(n^2), our algorithm can solve SDPs in m^\u03c9 time. This suggests solving SDP is nearly as fast as solving a linear system with equal number of variables and constraints. It is the first result that tall dense SDP can be solved in a nearly-optimal running time, and it also improves the state-of-the-art SDP solver [Jiang, Kathuria, Lee, Padmanabhan and Song, FOCS 2020]. In addition to our new IPM analysis, our algorithm also relies on a number of new techniques that might be of further interest, such as, maintaining the inverse of a Kronecker product using lazy updates, and a general amortization scheme for positive semidefinite matrices.

The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora's Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that the random variables are distributed independently. In this work, we consider Pandora's Box-type problems with correlations. Whereas the independent distributions setting is efficiently solvable, the correlated setting is hard and captures as special cases several algorithmic problems that have been studied previously -- e.g. min sum set cover and optimal decision tree. We provide the first approximation algorithms for the correlated setting under various distributional models. This talk is based on two papers with coauthors Evangelia Gergatsouli, Jeremy McMahan, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang. The first appeared at FOCS'20 and the second is under preparation. 05/03/2023 Yifeng Teng , Google Research Prophet Secretary Against the Online Optimal In the prophet secretary problem, a sequence of random variables with independent known distributions arrive in uniformly random order. Upon seeing a realized value at each step, an online decision-maker has to either select it and stop or irrevocably discard it. The goal is to maximize the expected value of the selected variable. Traditionally, the chosen benchmark is the expected reward of the prophet, who knows all the values in advance and can always select the maximum one. In this work, we study the prophet secretary problem against a less pessimistic but equally well-motivated benchmark; the online optimal. Here, the main goal is to find polynomial-time algorithms that guarantee near-optimal expected reward. As a warm-up, we present a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) through careful discretization and non-trivial bundling processes. Using the toolbox developed for the QPTAS, coupled with a novel frontloading technique that enables us to reduce the number of decisions we need to make, we are able to remove the dependence on the number of items in the exponent of the running time, and obtain the first polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem. 05/05/2023 Raghu\u00a0Meka , UCLA Strong bounds for 3-progressions Suppose you have a set S of integers from \\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\} that contains at least N / C elements. Then for large enough N , must S contain three equally spaced numbers (i.e., a 3-term arithmetic progression)? In 1953, Roth showed that this is indeed the case when C > \\Omega(\\log \\log N), while Behrend in 1946 showed that C can be at most 2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log N})}. Since then, the problem has been a cornerstone of the area of additive combinatorics. Following a series of remarkable results, a celebrated paper from 2020 due to Bloom and Sisask improved the lower bound on C to C = (\\log N)^{1+c}, for some constant c > 0. This talk will describe a new work that C >2^{\\Omega((\\log N)^{0.09})}, thus getting closer to Behrend's construction. Based on joint work with Zander Kelley.

They enable a computationally-bounded prover to convince a verifier of multiple NP statements with communication that is much smaller than the total witness length and with verification time that is smaller than individually checking each instance. In this talk, I describe a new and direct approach for constructing batch arguments from standard cryptographic assumptions on groups with bilinear maps (e.g., the subgroup decision or the k-Lin assumption). Our approach avoids heavy tools like correlation-intractable hash functions or probabilistically-checkable proofs common to previous approaches. In turn, we also obtain the first construction of batch arguments for NP from standard bilinear map assumptions. As corollaries to our main construction, we also obtain a delegation scheme for RAM programs (also known as a succinct non-interactive argument for P) as well as an aggregate signature scheme supporting bounded aggregation from standard bilinear map assumptions in the plain model.

We give overwhelming evidence that APEPP, defined originally by Kleinberg et al., is the natural complexity class associated with explicit constructions of objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method, by placing a variety of such construction problems in this class. We then demonstrate that a result of Je\u0159\u00e1bek on provability in Bounded Arithmetic, when reinterpreted as a reduction between search problems, shows that constructing a truth table of high circuit complexity is complete for APEPP under PNP reductions. This illustrates that Shannon's classical proof of the existence of hard boolean functions is in fact a universal probabilistic existence argument: derandomizing his proof implies a generic derandomization of the probabilistic method. As a corollary, we prove that EXPNP contains a language of circuit complexity 2^n^\u03a9(1) if and only if it contains a language of circuit complexity 2^n/2n. Finally, for several of the problems shown to lie in APEPP, we demonstrate direct polynomial time reductions to the explicit construction of hard truth tables. 03/11/2022 Matthew Ferland, USC Winning the War by (Strategically) Losing Battles: Settling the Complexity of Grundy-Values in Undirected Geography We settle two long-standing complexity-theoretical questions-open since 1981 and 1993-in combinatorial game theory (CGT). We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of Undirected Geography is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with a result from 1993 that Undirected Geography is polynomial-time solvable. By distilling to a simple reduction, our proof further establishes a dichotomy theorem, providing a \"phase transition to intractability\" in Grundy-value computation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundy value of Undirected Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-time computable, but over degree-four graphs-even when planar and bipartite-is PSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to construct Undirected Geography instances with Grundy value \u2217n and size polynomial in n. We strengthen a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisan games are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental ways. First, since Undirected Geography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums to impartial games, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not built from a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth game positions. We use the sum of two Undirected Geography positions to create our hard instances. Our result also has computational implications to Sprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of the disjunctive sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomial time-from their Grundy values. In contrast, we prove that assuming PSPACE \u2260 P, there is no general polynomial-time method to summarize two polynomial-time solvable impartial games to efficiently solve their disjunctive sum. 03/25/2022 Lisa Sauermann, MIT List-decoding for Reed-Solomon codes Reed-Solomon codes are an important and intensively studied class of error-correcting codes. After giving some background, this talk will discuss the so-called list-decoding problem for Reed-Solomon codes. More specifically, we prove that for any fixed list-decoding parameters, there exist Reed-Solomon codes with a certain rate, which is optimal up to a constant factor. This in particular answers a question of Guo, Li, Shangguan, Tamo, and Wootters about list-decodability of Reed-Solomon codes with radius close to 1. Joint work with Asaf Ferber and Matthew Kwan. 04/01/2022 Kevin Tian, Stanford University Semi-Random Sparse Recovery in Nearly-Linear Time Sparse recovery is one of the most fundamental and well-studied inverse problems. Standard statistical formulations of the problem are provably solved by general convex programming techniques and more practical, fast (nearly-linear time) iterative methods. However, these latter \"fast algorithms\" have previously been observed to be brittle in various real-world settings. We investigate the brittleness of fast sparse recovery algorithms to generative model changes through the lens of studying their robustness to a \"helpful\" semi-random adversary, a framework which tests whether an algorithm overfits to input assumptions. We consider the following basic model: let A be an nxd measurement matrix which contains an unknown mxd subset of rows G which are bounded and satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP), but is otherwise arbitrary. Letting x* in R^d be s-sparse, and given either exact measurements b = Ax* or noisy measurements b = Ax* + xi, we design algorithms recovering x* information-theoretically optimally in nearly-linear time. We extend our algorithm to hold for weaker generative models relaxing our planted RIP row subset assumption to a natural weighted variant, and show that our method's guarantees naturally interpolate the quality of the measurement matrix to, in some parameter regimes, run in sublinear time. Our approach differs from that of prior fast iterative methods with provable guarantees under semi-random generative models (Cheng and Ge '18, Li et al. '20), which typically separate the problem of learning the planted instance from the estimation problem, i.e. they attempt to first learn the planted \"good\" instance (in our case, the matrix G). However, natural conditions on a submatrix which make sparse recovery tractable, such as RIP, are NP-hard to verify and hence first learning a sufficient row reweighting appears challenging. We eschew this approach and design a new iterative method, tailored to the geometry of sparse recovery, which is provably robust to our semi-random model. Our hope is that our approach opens the door to new robust, efficient algorithms for other natural statistical inverse problems. Based on joint work with Jonathan Kelner, Jerry Li, Allen Liu, and Aaron Sidford 04/08/2022 Debmalya Panigrahi, Duke University Recent Results in Minimum Cut Algorithms Minimum cut problems are among the most basic questions in algorithm design. In the last few years, there has been a resurgence in new results in this domain, resulting in the first improvements in many decades for problems such as global min-cut, vertex min-cut, all-pairs min-cut, etc. In this talk, I will explore some of these results, focusing on the broad themes and techniques that have driven this progress. This talk will be based on papers that have appeared in FOCS '20, STOC '21, and FOCS '21. 04/15/2022 William Hoza, Simons Institute Fooling Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits We present the first non-trivial pseudorandom generator (PRG) for linear threshold (LTF) circuits of arbitrary constant depth and super-linear size. This PRG fools circuits with depth d and n^{1 + delta} wires, where delta = exp(-O(d)), using seed length O(n^{1 - delta}) and with error exp(-n^{delta}). This tightly matches the best known lower bounds for this circuit class. As a consequence of our result, all the known hardness for LTF circuits has now effectively been translated into pseudorandomness. This brings the extensive effort in the last decade to construct PRGs and deterministic circuit-analysis algorithms for this class to the point where any subsequent improvement would yield breakthrough lower bounds. A key ingredient in our construction is a pseudorandom restriction procedure that has tiny failure probability, but simplifies the function to a non-natural \"hybrid computational model\" that combines decision trees and LTFs. As part of our proof we also construct an \"extremely low-error\" PRG for the class of functions computable by an arbitrary function of s linear threshold functions that can handle even the extreme setting of parameters s = n/polylog(n) and epsilon = exp(-n/polylog(n)). Joint work with Pooya Hatami, Avishay Tal, and Roei Tell. 04/22/2022 Sushant Sachdeva, University of Toronto Almost Linear Time Algorithms for Max-Flow and More ***There will be an additional 15-minute optional portion of the talk immediately afterwards in order to fully convey the main ideas of the work.*** We give the first almost-linear time algorithm for computing exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows on directed graphs. By well-known reductions, this implies almost-linear time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching, optimal transport, and undirected vertex connectivity. Our algorithm is designed using a new Interior Point Method (IPM) that builds the flow as a sequence of almost-linear number of approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles, each of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic data structure. Our framework extends to give an almost-linear time algorithm for computing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high accuracy. This gives the first almost-linear time algorithm for several problems including entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, p-norm flows, and Isotonic regression.

Starting with the work of Le Gall [SPAA `06], it has been known that quantum streaming algorithms can use asymptotically less space than their classical counterparts for certain problems. However, so far, all known examples of quantum advantages in streaming are for problems that are either specially constructed for that purpose, or require many streaming passes over the input. We give a one-pass quantum streaming algorithm for one of the best studied problems in classical graph streaming - the triangle counting problem. Almost-tight parametrized upper and lower bounds are known for this problem in the classical setting; our algorithm uses polynomially less space in certain regions of the parameter space, resolving a question posed by Jain and Nayak in 2014 on achieving quantum advantages for natural streaming problems. 05/06/2022 Dean Doron, Ben-Gurion University Approximating Large Powers of Stochastic Matrices in Small Space We give a deterministic space-efficient algorithm for approximating powers of stochastic matrices. On input a w\u00d7w stochastic matrix A, our algorithm approximates An in space O(log n + \u221alog n \u00b7 log w) to within high accuracy. This improves upon the seminal work by Saks and Zhou, that requires O(log3/2n + \u221alog n\u00b7log w) space, in the regime n \u226b w.

Our results also imply that the class CLS (Continuous Local Search) - which was defined by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou as a more \"natural\" counterpart to PPAD \u2229 PLS and contains many interesting problems - is itself equal to PPAD \u2229 PLS. 09/03/2021 Nathan Klein , University of Washington A (Slightly) Improved Approximation Algorithm for Metric TSP I will describe work in which we obtain a 3/2-epsilon approximation algorithm for metric TSP, for some epsilon>10^{-36}. This slightly improves over the classical 3/2 approximation algorithm due to Christofides [1976] and Serdyukov [1978]. The talk will focus on giving an overview of the key ideas involved, such as properties of Strongly Rayleigh distributions and the structure of near minimum cuts. This is joint work with Anna Karlin and Shayan Oveis Gharan. 09/10/2021 Vishesh Jain , Stanford University, Stein Fellow Towards the Sampling\u00a0Lov\u00e1sz\u00a0Local Lemma For a constraint satisfaction problem which satisfies the condition of the Lov\u00e1sz local lemma (LLL), the celebrated algorithm of Moser and Tardos allows one to efficiently find a satisfying assignment. In the past few years, much work has gone into understanding whether one can efficiently sample from (approximately) the uniform distribution on satisfying assignments under LLL-like conditions. I will discuss recent progress on this problem, joint with Huy Tuan Pham (Stanford) and Thuy Duong Vuong (Stanford). 09/17/2021 Seth Pettie , University of Michigan Information Theoretic Limits of Cardinality Estimation: Fisher Meets Shannon Estimating the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a large multiset is a classic problem in streaming and sketching, dating back to Flajolet and Martin's classic Probabilistic Counting (PCSA) algorithm from 1983. In this paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the sketch and its estimation error in the random oracle model. We define a new measure of efficiency for cardinality estimators called the Fisher-Shannon (Fish) number H/I. It captures the tension between the limiting Shannon entropy (H) of the sketch and its normalized Fisher information (I), which characterizes the variance of a statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our results are as follows: We prove that all base-q variants of Flajolet and Martin's PCSA sketch have Fish-number H0/I0\u22481.98016 and that every base-q variant of (Hyper)LogLog has Fish-number worse than H0/I0, but that they tend to H0/I0 in the limit as q\u2192\u221e. Here H0,I0 are precisely defined constants. We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed, entropy-compressed variant of PCSA with a different estimator function. It is proved that with high probability, Fishmonger processes a multiset of [U] such that at all times, its space is O(log2logU)+(1+o(1))(H0/I0)b\u22481.98b bits and its standard error is 1/sqrt(b). We give circumstantial evidence that H0/I0 is the optimum Fish-number of mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a class of linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat H0/I0. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable. 10/01/2021 Roei Tell , IAS+DIMACS Hardness vs Randomness, Revised: Uniform, Non-Black-Box, and Instance-Wise Textbook hardness-to-randomness converts circuit lower bounds into PRGs. But is this black-box approach really necessary for derandomization? In this talk I'll show how to revamp the classical hardness-to-randomness framework, converting new types of *uniform lower bounds* into *non-black-box derandomization*. This yields conclusions such as promiseBPP = promiseP without PRGs, and reveals a close connection between worst-case derandomization and the new types of uniform lower bounds. Another instantiation of this new framework allows to deduce, under plausible hypotheses, that randomness can be eliminated at essentially no observable cost when solving decision problems. Based on joint work with Lijie Chen . 10/08/2021 Eric Vigoda , UCSB Computational Phase Transition for Approximate Counting Spectral independence is a new technique, recently introduced by Anari et al (2020), for establishing rapid mixing results for\u00a0Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\u00a0We show that spectral independence implies optimal convergence rate for a variety of MCMC algorithms. This yields a dramatic computational phase transition for various approximate counting problems such as weighted independent sets. This talk is based on joint works with Zongchen Chen (MIT) and Kuikui\u00a0Liu (Washington). 10/15/2021 Srikanth Srinivasan , Aarhus University Superpolynomial\u00a0Lower\u00a0Bounds Against Low-Depth\u00a0Algebraic Circuits Every multivariate polynomial P(x_1,...,x_n) can be written as a sum of monomials, i.e. a sum of products of variables and field constants. In general, the size of such an expression is the number of monomials that have a non-zero coefficient in P. What happens if we add another layer of complexity, and consider sums of products of sums (of variables and field constants) expressions? Now, it becomes unclear how to prove that a given polynomial P(x_1,...,x_n) does not have small expressions. In this result, we solve exactly this problem. More precisely, we prove that certain explicit polynomials have no polynomial-sized \"Sigma-Pi-Sigma\" (sums of products of sums) representations. We can also show similar results for Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi, Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi-Sigma and so on for all \"constant-depth\" expressions. Based on joint work with Nutan Limaye (ITU Copenhagen + IIT Bombay) and S\u00e9bastien Tavenas (USMB + Univ. Grenoble, CNRS). 10/22/2021 Amnon Ta-Shma , Tel-Aviv University Expander Random Walks:\u00a0A Fourier-Analytic\u00a0Approach We consider the following question: Assume the vertices of an expander graph are labelled by {1,-1}. What test functions can or cannot distinguish t independent samples from those obtained by a random walk? We prove all symmetric functions are fooled by random walks on expanders with constant spectral gap. We use Fourier analysis noticing that the bias of character $\\chi_S$ \u00a0is determined not only by the cardinality of S, but also by the distances between the elements in S. The talk is based on two papers: - Expander Random Walks: A Fourier-Analytic Approach with Gil Cohen and Noam Peri, and, - Expander Random Walks: The General Case and Limitations with Gil Cohen, Dor Minzer, Shir Peleg and Aaron Potechin. 11/05/2021 Joe\u00a0Neeman , UT\u00a0Austin Robust Testing\u00a0of Low-Dimensional Functions\u00a0\u00a0*Hybrid Event: To be hosted virtually\u00a0and in person in\u00a0GDC\u00a04.304* A natural problem in high-dimensional inference is to decide if a classifier f:Rn\u2192{\u22121,1} depends on a small number of linear directions of its input data. Call a function g:Rn\u2192{\u22121,1}, a linear k-junta if it is completely determined by some k-dimensional subspace of the input space. A recent work of the authors showed that linear k-juntas are testable. Thus there exists an algorithm to distinguish between: 1. f:Rn\u2192{\u22121,1} which is a linear k-junta with surface area s, 2. f is \u03f5-far from any linear k-junta with surface area (1+\u03f5)s, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent of the ambient dimension n. Following the surge of interest in noise-tolerant property testing, in this paper we prove a noise-tolerant (or robust) version of this result. Namely, we give an algorithm which given any c>0, \u03f5>0, distinguishes between 1. f:Rn\u2192{\u22121,1} has correlation at least c with some linear k-junta with surface area s. 2. f has correlation at most c\u2212\u03f5 with any linear k-junta with surface area at most s. The query complexity of our tester is kpoly(s/\u03f5). Using our techniques, we also obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with the same query complexity for any class C of linear k-juntas with surface area bounded by s. As a consequence, we obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with query complexity kO(poly(logk/\u03f5)) for the class of intersection of k-halfspaces (for constant k) over the Gaussian space. Our query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension n. Previously, no non-trivial noise tolerant testers were known even for a single halfspace. 11/12/2021 Virgina\u00a0Williams , MIT Hardness of Approximate Diameter: Now for Undirected Gra phs Approximating the graph diameter is a basic task of both theoretical and practical interest. A simple folklore algorithm can output a 2-approximation to the diameter in linear time by running BFS from an arbitrary vertex. It has been open whether a better approximation is possible in near-linear time. A series of papers on fine-grained complexity have led to strong hardness results for diameter, culminating in our recent tradeoff curve in the upcoming FOCS'21 joint with Ray Li and Mina Dalirrooyfard, showing that under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for any integer k\u22652 and \u03b4>0, a 2\u22121/k\u2212\u03b4 approximation for diameter in m-edge graphs requires mn^{1+1/(k\u22121)\u2212o(1)} time. In particular, the simple linear time 2-approximation algorithm is optimal. In this talk I will give an overview of the known algorithms and fine-grained lower bounds for diameter, including the SETH-based optimality of the 2-approximation algorithm. 11/19/2021 Minshen\u00a0Zhu , Purdue University Exponential Lower Bounds for Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes for Insertions and Deletions\u00a0*\u00a0Event Begins at\u00a011:00 AM* Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes for which individual message symbols can be quickly recovered despite errors in the codeword. LDCs for Hamming errors have been studied extensively in the past few decades, where a major goal is to understand the amount of redundancy that is necessary and sufficient to decode from large amounts of error, with small query complexity. Despite exciting progress, we still don\u2019t have satisfactory answers in several important parameter regimes. For example, in the case of 3-query LDCs, the gap between existing constructions and lower bounds is superpolynomial in the message length. In this work we study LDCs for insertion and deletion errors, called Insdel LDCs. Their study was initiated by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky (Information Theoretic Security, 2015), who gave a reduction from Hamming LDCs to Insdel LDCs with a small blowup in the code parameters. On the other hand, the only known lower bounds for Insdel LDCs come from those for Hamming LDCs, thus there is no separation between them. Here we prove new, strong lower bounds for the existence of Insdel LDCs. In particular, we show that 2-query linear Insdel LDCs do not exist, and give an exponential lower bound for the length of all q-query Insdel LDCs with constant q. For q \u2265 3 our bounds are exponential in the existing lower bounds for Hamming LDCs. Furthermore, our exponential lower bounds continue to hold for adaptive decoders, and even in private-key settings where the encoder and decoder share secret randomness. This exhibits a strict separation between Hamming LDCs and Insdel LDCs. Our strong lower bounds also hold for the related notion of Insdel LCCs (except in the private-key setting), due to an analogue to the Insdel notions of a reduction from Hamming LCCs to LDCs. Our techniques are based on a delicate design and analysis of hard distributions of insertion and deletion errors, which depart significantly from typical techniques used in analyzing Hamming LDCs\u00a0. 12/03/2021 Shai\u00a0Evra , Hebrew University of Jerusalem Locally Testable Codes with Constant Rate, Distance, and Locality A locally testable code (LTC) is an error correcting code that has a property-tester. The tester reads q bits that are randomly chosen, and rejects words with probability proportional to their distance from the code. The parameter q is called the locality of the tester. LTCs were initially studied as important components of PCPs, and since then the topic has evolved on its own. High rate LTCs could be useful in practice: before attempting to decode a received word, one can save time by first quickly testing if it is close to the code. An outstanding open question has been whether there exist \"c3-LTCs\", namely LTCs with *c*onstant rate, *c*onstant distance, and *c*onstant locality. In this work we construct such codes based on a new two-dimensional complex which we call a left-right Cayley complex. This is essentially a graph which, in addition to vertices and edges, also has squares. Our codes can be viewed as a two-dimensional version of (the one-dimensional) expander codes, where the codewords are functions on the squares rather than on the edges.",

Kathryn McKinley, who formerly served as an Endowed Professor here at UTCS but is currently on leave to work with Microsoft, spoke on behalf of Microsoft at the first meeting of the House Science Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Research and Science Education on the topic of information technology innovation. McKinley began her testimony with a discussion of the importance of government funding of the research ecosystem. She pointed out how IT research has led to new jobs and industries that ultimately make us safer, healthier, more effective, and happier. McKinley used Microsoft Xbox Kinect as an example of an innovative piece of technology that came as a result of 20 years of investment and research. Today, Kinect is making changes to advance learning, health, and retail developments. McKinley listed big data, privacy, secure systems, and computing performance as some of the most urgent and important research areas. She went on to discuss global competition in an effort to urge the government to keep providing funding for these research areas. \u201cIf the overall rate of innovation slows,\u201d McKinley explained, \u201cit will be easier for other countries to close the gap, and the U.S. will lose its economic and national security advantages.\u201d McKinley\u2019s final topic was education. She noted how the demand for computing jobs in the U.S. far outstrips the number of people earning bachelor degrees in the field. McKinley defined the lack of women and minorities in computer science as one of the biggest challenges in computing today. According to her, there is a huge need for increased efforts to integrate computer science into the standard K12 educational system. She concluded her talk of education by warning Congress that \u201cThe U.S. simply cannot afford to fail to capitalize on 70 percent of its population if it wants to remain globally competitive.\u201d Although McKinley\u2019s testimonial was addressed to members of the House, there is much for us to take away from her words. Understanding the importance of continuing to research and develop better technologies is crucial to our success as a nation. For computer science students at UT, McKinley\u2019s speech serves as a reminder of the impact they will soon make on the country as a whole.

    "text_content": "Texas Unleashes Stampede for Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Texas Unleashes Stampede for Science Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, April 10, 2013 You hear it before you see it \u2014 a roar like a factory in full production. But instead of cars or washing machines, this factory produces scientific knowledge. Stampede, the newest supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and one of the most advanced scientific research instruments in the world, fills aisle after aisle of a new 11,000-square-foot data center on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus. Through the glass machine room doors, you can see 182 racks holding more than 500,000 interconnected computer processors. Inside, wind whips from in-row coolers, wires snake over the racks and chilled water courses below the floor as Stampede performs calculations on behalf of scientists and engineers nationwide. Over the past year TACC staff designed, built and deployed Stampede, working closely with Dell and Intel engineers and university researchers. TACC and The University of Texas at Austin competed against the top supercomputing centers and universities to claim one of the most advanced systems in the world \u2014 and won. The award was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with an estimated investment of more than $50 million over a four-year period. The project may be renewed in 2017, which would enable four more years of open science research. According to the November 2012 Top 500 list of supercomputers , Stampede is the seventh-most powerful advanced computing system on the planet and the most powerful in the U.S. dedicated to academic research, capable of outperforming 100,000 home computers. On Wednesday, March 27, leaders from government, academia and industry, including The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s President Bill Powers , Jay Boisseau of TACC, Marius Haas of Dell, Diane Bryant of Intel, Farnam Jahanian of the NSF and U.S. Congressman Lamar Smith , will dedicate Stampede and kick off a new era of advanced computing at the university and nationally. \u201cThis is a proud moment for The University of Texas,\u201d President Powers says. \u201cStampede will serve UT and the nation as it enables scientific exploration that would not otherwise be possible, and it continues TACC\u2019s tradition of providing powerful, comprehensive and leading-edge advanced computing technologies to the open science community.\u201d As its name suggests, Stampede harnesses the power of a half-million computer processors and combines them to tackle ever larger and more challenging computational problems. Sixteen times more powerful than the recently decommissioned Ranger system (which was most recently ranked as the 50th-fastest supercomputer in the world), Stampede will enable scientists to address new classes of problems they\u2019ve never been able to approach before. \u201cHow often does a scientist get an instrument that\u2019s an order of magnitude more powerful than the one it replaces?\u201d says Omar Ghattas , the John A. and Katherine G. Jackson Chair in Computational Geosciences. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive step.\u201d In recent years, supercomputers have become critical general-purpose instruments for conducting scientific research. Known as the \u201cthird pillar\u201d of science, computer simulations and models complement theory and experimentation and allow researchers to explore phenomena that cannot be captured via observation or laboratory experiments. Supercomputers also allow scholars to mine massive databases of information for digital needles-in-haystacks that otherwise would go unnoticed \u2014 such as subtle changes in DNA or the signs of a newly discovered galaxy in a far corner of the universe. Closer to home, the weather report you checked before going outside, the car you drove to work, the flu shot that protected you from illness \u2014 all of these were, at least in part, designed, improved or predicted by a supercomputer. The reason supercomputers are so important is simple: The universe is governed by mathematical equations, and computers can solve these equations far faster than humans. Enormous supercomputers, like Stampede, enable researchers to solve scientific problems that humans alone would find impossible \u2014 the kind that help predict where a hurricane will make landfall, how a new drug will interact with its target, or what mutations in our genetic code make us prone to developing certain diseases. Stampede acts as a \u201ccomputational microscope\u201d that allows scientists to explore the inner dynamics of the cell better than with the best imaging devices; helps astronomers peer deeper into the universe\u2019s past than is possible with the most powerful telescopes; enables researchers to develop new materials to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere; identifies brain tumors more accurately ; and discovers new medicines faster and less expensively than in a laboratory. Stampede will even help researchers in the digital arts and humanities study literature and music in ways they never imagined before. In the past, supercomputers were often used for a small subset of science and engineering problems. But systems like Stampede, with its comprehensive capabilities, allow many more users to simulate, visualize, analyze, store and share their knowledge with others around the world. In the first three months of operations, approximately 600 projects and more than 1,200 scientists have used Stampede, which came online in January 2013. These include top researchers in every field of inquiry from mechanical engineering to linguistics to neuroscience. In its lifetime, Stampede is expected to deliver the equivalent of more than 400,000 years of computing to tens of thousands of scientists. Imagine the results Stampede will enable across all fields of knowledge. Tags Featured College & Campus Main Page Research Computer Science Stampede supercomputers TACC",

Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, February 15, 2013 KNOW | Video by Daniel Oppenheimer, College of Natural Sciences http://youtu.be/Ptnl_gFhDAs In this short video William Press , outgoing president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , reflects on \u201cthe beauty and benefits of science,\u201d the theme he chose for his presidential address at the association\u2019s recent conference . Press\u2019 term as president formally ended at the conclusion of the conference, held Feb. 13-17 in Boston. \u201cThe beauty of science has often been those aha moments when you\u2019re working on something fairly mathematically,\u201d says Press, the Warren J. and Viola M. Raymer Professor in Computer Science and in Integrative Biology. \u201cThen at some point you realize the structure in the equations, the way the equations are working, exactly mimics some set of data about the real world, something that hasn\u2019t been understood previously. And then you say \u2014 this is beautiful.\u201d Press is a vice-chair of the U.S. President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and one of the co-authors of \u201c Transformation and Opportunity ,\u201d a report to the president about the future of basic science and research funding in the United States. In an op-ed published this month in Science Magazine , Press argues that the public deserves far more credit than it gets from politicians for its appreciation of the long-term benefits of funding scientific research. He writes: \u201cPolls show that in the United States, the public ranks science as one of the most prestigious occupations, along with firefighters, doctors, nurses, teachers, and military officers. Thus, science is in the company of professions whose benefit to people is immediate. Yet, when I ask nonscientists about the benefits of science, few give answers that imply the short time horizons that motivate most economic activity. They like science because, among other things, it can lead to longer, healthier lives; protect the planet and feed humanity; and channel and empower the natural idealism of young people; and it satisfies a basic human need to understand the world. \u201cThe public recognizes science as having long-term, often idealistic, goals, yet accords scientists a level of respect otherwise reserved for \u2018immediate helper\u2019 occupations. The combination suggests an instinctive understanding of heavy-tailed distributions and the patient investor\u2019s bounty. Put differently, the public realizes that the beauty and benefits of science are inseparable as a single long-term enterprise. Elected public officials worldwide would do well to listen to this particular wisdom of crowds.\u201d News Categories Faculty Industry Relations Research Tags William Press",

    "text_content": "Chemistry Major Wade Wang Is Helping to Build a Better Microchip | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Chemistry Major Wade Wang Is Helping to Build a Better Microchip Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, January 25, 2013 When 17-year-old chemistry major Wade Wang arrived in the lab of professor C. Grant Willson, he was presented with a challenge. Actually the whole lab was presented with a challenge. Willson has been a pioneer in developing technologies that enable the manufacturing of smaller, faster, and more efficient microelectronic components. One of his latest projects, funded by Intel, was to advance a technique known as pitch-division lithography. If the technique could be perfected, it could double the number of transistors that Intel could fit on one of their microchips, and it could do so without requiring massive new investment in equipment. The lab had already overcome many of the obstacles by the time Wang arrived, but there was a key compound that needed to be synthesized, a \u201ctwo stage photobase generator.\u201d So far all efforts to synthesize it, including those by an outside chemical company, had failed. So Willson did what he often does in such situations. He offered a cash prize. Wang, who is now 20 and set to graduate in May, won it. The Foundation: Writing with Light To understand why it was important that Wang successfully synthesized a two stage photobase generator, it helps to begin with the process for making transistors, which is called photolithography. Photolithography begins when you shine light through a stencil-like mask onto what\u2019s basically a cake with a top layer of icing. The cake is the silicon wafer that will eventually become the transistor. The icing is a polymer called a \u201cphotoresist,\u201d which is designed to generate acid when struck by light. That acid makes it soluble, so it can be removed with some processing. The remaining photoresist, which wasn\u2019t touched by light, protects the parts of the silicon that need to remain pure. \u201cTo make a transistor you have to induce impurities in the silicon,\u201d explains Wang, \u201cand it\u2019s an incredibly delicate process. You have to have different regions with different impurities, and if they don\u2019t go in exactly the right spot it won\u2019t work. So what this process is helping you do is cover some spots you don\u2019t want to touch and manipulate the spots that are exposed.\u201d For the past few decades researchers have been able to double the amount of transistors on a chip every 18 to 24 months\u2014what\u2019s known as Moore\u2019s Law\u2014by tinkering with three of the four basic elements in the process. They\u2019ve improved the lens used to shine the light. They\u2019ve reduced the wavelength of the light. And they\u2019ve used masks with finer and finer slits. Each advance has meant smaller and smaller transistors. The gains to be harvested in these areas, however, are now running up against hard physical limits. \u201cUltimately you can only make features as small as your light allows,\u201d says Wang. \u201cAt some point you\u2019re trying to draw thin lines with a dull pencil. That\u2019s the point we\u2019ve reached, at the physical limits of this technique. If we want to continue making smaller features we either have to change to a new technique or we have to play with another element in the process. So what we\u2019re asking is: Can you do something new in the chemistry of the photoresist?\u201d Writing Two Lines Where Once There Was One Pitch-division lithography exploits a subtlety of what happens to light when it passes through the mask. It gets diffracted a bit, so it ends up hitting the photoresist at different intensities. \u201cThink of it as one wavelength of a sine curve,\u201d says Wang. \u201cSo you peak in the middle and decrease on either side.\u201d In standard photolithography this doesn\u2019t matter much because all you\u2019re trying to do is induce one chemical change, which happens in the region exposed to the peak intensity light. What if, however, you could create a photoresist that generates the optimal amount of acid not when there is peak light\u2014since there\u2019s only one peak per exposure\u2014but when there is an intermediate intensity of light, since that intermediate intensity occurs twice per exposure? Then when the photoresist is treated, two areas would be removed, and you\u2019d functionally double the amount of features you could create in the same area of the silicon. To achieve this profile, Willson\u2019s lab turned to one of those principles of chemistry that kids learn in grade school. Acids and bases neutralize each other. They designed a photoresist that contains both light-sensitive acid-generators and light-sensitive base generators. But they made sure the base-generators were less sensitive to light. With this difference in sensitivities, different intensities of light should generate varying amounts of acid and base during a given exposure. Under peak light conditions, a lot of acid is generated but so is a lot of base. There\u2019s enough base, in fact, to wholly neutralize the acid. Then it\u2019s as if the photoresist hasn\u2019t received any exposure. In the intermediate zones, however, a bunch of acid is generated but the base is generating too slowly to fully quench the acid. And in those two regions, separated by the area where the acid and base had cancelled out, the acid concentrations will render the photoresist soluble. \u201cSo you have a region in the beginning where it is being developed away,\u201d says Wang, \u201cthen at the peak where there\u2019s a lot of acid and base it\u2019s not, then it is.\u201d When Wang arrived in Willson\u2019s lab, this basic technique had already been developed. They were able draw two lines on the silicon from only one on the mask. The problem was that the lines were rough at the edges. \u201cWe called it a low chemical contrast,\u201d says Wang. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of the fact that in the intermediate regions you still get generation of base. It\u2019s slow but there is a little and you\u2019re partially quenching the acid, so the amount of acid is not increasing as quickly as you\u2019d get in a conventional resist. If you\u2019re not changing the boundary between soluble and not soluble as fast, it\u2019s going to be kind of blurry.\u201d Sharpening the Lines What needed to be made was a compound that took a little while, after being exposed to light, to begin generating base. Then the acid concentration could rise more dramatically, and there\u2019d be more chemical contrast, which would lead to sharper lines. \u201cWhat we hypothesized,\u201d says Wang, \u201cwas that you could get this delay if you could move from first-order to second-order reaction kinetics.\u201d What that\u2019s meant, in practice, has been trying to synthesize a base generator that starts out in a latent form. The first photon that hits it wouldn\u2019t trigger the generation of base. Instead it would change it to its active form by, for instance, cleaving away one part of the compound. Then the next photon would trigger the process of generating base. After many (many) failures, Wang finally succeeded during fall 2012. The trick, he says, wasn\u2019t knowing the final chemical structure he wanted. That was known all along. The trick was getting there, figuring out how to facilitate each step in a multi-step process. In particular there was one solvent, toluene, that helped facilitate the key reaction where the rest of the solvents he\u2019d tried didn\u2019t work. It was some luck, some science, but mostly persistence. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about chemistry,\u201d says Wang. \u201cYou can know the structure you want. You can be familiar with reactions that should, in theory, produce it. But strange things happen. Synthesis is very sensitive to conditions, and you don\u2019t always understand how or why. So you keep trying different things, holding different variables constant while changing others, and you hope that you find a way through.\u201d Wang\u2019s initial results were good enough to win the prize from Willson. His molecule responded to light in precisely the way he was hoping. The next step is embed the molecule in a fully formed photoresist, then test it again. Willson has sent it out to a colleague at a semiconductor company to do that, and they\u2019re waiting on the results. If those results are good, the lab can refine the process until one day, perhaps, they\u2019ll hand it over to Intel, where it could help build the next generation of chips. By that point, if it comes, Wang is likely to be in graduate school, earning his doctorate in organic chemistry. If it doesn\u2019t come, for whatever reason, Wang is still likely to be in graduate school, tinkering around with molecules, hoping that good luck, skill, insight, and persistence will combine to lead to further discoveries. \u201cIt\u2019s the challenge I like,\u201d he says, \u201cand the complexity, and being able to use my hands, to be at the lab bench manipulating things. There are so many different factors to keep in mind, different potential routes to get to the final structure you\u2019re trying to create. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d Tags Chemistry Computer Science Research Featured",

    "text_content": "C. Grant Willson Wins Japan Prize | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content C. Grant Willson Wins Japan Prize Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, January 30, 2013 AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 C. Grant Willson, professor of chemistry and chemical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, has won the Japan Prize , an international award similar to the Nobel Prize, for his development of a process that is now used to manufacture nearly all of the microprocessors and memory chips in the world. He\u2019s sharing the 50 million yen (approximately $560,000 in U.S. dollars) prize with his colleague and friend Jean M.J. Fr\u00e9chet , who is now vice president for research and professor of chemical science at King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia. The winners were announced today in a ceremony in Tokyo. The Japan Prize Presentation Ceremony and Banquet, with the emperor of Japan in attendance, will take place in Tokyo on Wednesday, April 24, 2013. Willson and Fr\u00e9chet first conceived of \u201c chemically amplifed resists ,\u201d the materials for which they are being recognized, in 1979. Willson was a researcher at IBM Corp., and Fr\u00e9chet was spending a year with the company while on sabbatical from the University of Ottawa. \u201cMy boss came to me and said there is a crazy Frenchman who wants to come and spend a year here. Will you be his host?\u201d said Willson , professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the College of Natural Sciences and the Rashid Engineering Regents Chair in the Cockrell School of Engineering. \u201cI said, \u2018Let me do a bit of research on the guy,\u2019 I looked at his papers and they were excellent. He was really doing good science, so I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 He came to join me, and we started by having a great discussion about photoresists.\u201d Photoresists are light-sensitive materials that enable the basic process used to  manufacture computer chips. A pattern of light hits the photoresist, which covers the silicon wafer. The resist becomes soluble at only those points where the light hits. The exposed areas can then be dissolved away to leave patterned access to the silicon. The original pattern can then be transferred into the silicon. In this way the tiny electron-controlling patterns that lie at the foundation of modern computing are produced. At the time Willson and Fr\u00e9chet began talking, IBM was the world leader in manufacturing chips. Every two years or so, in keeping with \u201cMoore\u2019s Law,\u201d the company had been able to write smaller patterns on the silicon and thus double the number of devices on each chip. The company was nearing a point, however, when continuing that pace of development did not look possible. \u201cWe were stuck,\u201d said Willson. \u201cFurther shrinking of the devices demanded printing with shorter wavelength ultraviolet light. The light bulbs that were available did not produce much light at the shorter wavelength, and the photoresists then being used took hours to develop in response to the low light. It wasn\u2019t practical in terms of production. So we needed to develop new equipment or find photoresist materials that were orders of magnitude more sensitive.\u201d Willson and Fr\u00e9chet proposed using a catalyst to amplify the sensitivity of the photoresist. Instead of being dependent on one or multiple photons of light to trigger a chemical change in one molecule of the resist, with catalysts one photon could in theory set off a reaction that would \u201cchew up\u201d many of its neighbors as well. Thus light from the dimmer short wavelength light bulbs would be sufficient. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have worked,\u201d said Willson. \u201cIt should have been too blunt an instrument to draw fine lines. If you put a cow in a pasture, it will not stay put. It will wander around and keep eating until it eats up the whole field. Our catalysts should have eaten the whole field, but they didn\u2019t. For all practical purposes, they stayed put. We got very high sensitivity and very high resolution. It wasn\u2019t until much later, actually, after the thesis work of two University of Texas graduate students, that we finally figured out why the reaction is controlled in the way it is. At that time of the invention, though, we just needed to know that it worked reproducibly.\u201d Fr\u00e9chet, who left IBM at the end of the year, kept collaborating from afar. He and Willson were soon joined by Hiroshi Ito , whom Willson recruited from the State University of New York-Syracuse. Over the next few years the trio developed the process to the point where IBM was willing to put it into production. \u201cI still remember standing in the clean room at IBM\u2019s facilty in Burlington, Vermont, and watching huge numbers of parts being manufactured with our new material,\u201d said Willson. \u201cIt was a thrill that is difficult to describe.\u201d The chemically amplified resists and their descendants helped IBM maintain its edge in chip production for many years. The patents were licensed in the early 1990s, and many adaptations of the resist were developed. These commercially available materials are now used throughout the industry to enable technologies as diverse as mobile phones, personal computers, home appliances, automobiles and medical equipment. \u201cThe materials have gotten much more sophisticated,\u201d said Willson. \u201cBut the fundamental design concept is the same. We made the first cookie, and since then others have made almond cookies and chocolate chip cookies and cookies with a bit of coconut in them that taste better. Hiroshi, who died in 2010, continued to work on chemically amplified resists his entire life and made many important contributions to the modern formulations. If he were alive, he would have shared this prize with us.\u201d If potential next-generation methods such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography prove viable, the resists will live on with them. Ironically, Willson himself has placed his bets elsewhere, on a process called nanoimprint lithography that he and S.V.

What started out as a relatively small competition has grown dramatically, with the number of games produced going from only 370 in 2009 to over 2,100 in the 2012 competition. The 2013 contest took place over the weekend of January 25 th at 319 various jam sites in 63 countries, 38 US States, and 6 Canadian Provinces. Altogether, 11,474 \u201cjammers\u201d submitted a record-setting 3,248 games. The theme for this year\u2019s Game Jam was \u201cheartbeat.\u201d At the Austin competition, which was hosted by Skillpoint Alliance and the Austin chapter of the International Game Developer\u2019s Association, 107 talented programmers, artists, sound designers, and musicians showed up to participate. Two UT students did exceptionally well in Austin\u2019s Global Game Jam 2013. Aaron Belcher competed by himself, an impressive feat in itself, and won first place with a two person, cooperative game called Guiding Light. When asked about the game, Aaron said \u201c It was a really satisfying feeling, seeing someone play the game I had worked on, actually get into it, try to figure out what to do, and get frustrated at their partner to the point where they almost start yelling at each other. It was kind of funny, too, because a lot of puzzles were solved in ways I hadn't intended or thought of, so these people actually taught me a bit about how you can play the game.\u201d Demo of Guiding Light http://youtu.be/NQcfJwUfai8 The second place prize was awarded to a team of eight, one of whom was freshman Matthew Allen. Matthew\u2019s team created a game called Lurcher , a multi-player survival horror game where one player acts as a monster and stalks the other players through a forest. While other members of the team worked on visual and auditory features, Matt worked on programming the game. Although he admits to losing a lot of sleep, Matthew called the competition a \u201cgreat experience\u201d and recommends it to anyone who might be interested!

    "text_content": "A Reboot in Recruiting Women Into Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content A Reboot in Recruiting Women Into Computer Science Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, December 14, 2012 The Chronicle of Higher Education | By Ben Gose Cassidy Lamm, who grew up loving Disney movies like The Lion King, hopes to help create the next generation of animated films. When she checked into the credentials of current special-effects artists at Disney, she learned that many had majored in computer science. Now in her sophomore year at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, Ms. Lamm is among an increasingly rare breed\u2014women majoring in computer science. Nationwide, women earned only 18 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded in computer science in 2010, according to the National Science Foundation. That's less than half the proportion in 1985, when 37 percent of those degrees went to women. Despite attending a high school where her computing class taught her only how to use Microsoft Word, Ms. Lamm persevered through her first year of college-level programming courses, in which she estimates that men outnumbered women nearly tenfold. She even found time for an independent research project, creating a mobile-phone app to help autistic students better understand the emotions of other people. \"When girls think of computer science, they think of the gamers and sitting in a cubicle to program,\" Ms. Lamm says. \"But I've found that you can do so much more with it.\" The lack of interest among women in computer science is nothing new\u00ad\u2014government agencies, universities, and technology companies have plowed tens of millions of dollars into trying to raise the numbers for almost a decade, to little effect. And it's not simply that women are just making up a smaller proportional piece of a growing pie. The number of computer-science graduates stayed relatively flat from 1985 to 2010, at more than 39,000, while the number of women earning degrees in the field plummeted, from 14,431 to 7,306. The continuing dearth of women is especially puzzling given the way women have embraced new technologies like smartphones and tablets, and social networks like Facebook. Jeff Gray, an associate professor of computer science at Alabama, says about half the kids at his weeklong summer camps for middle-school students are girls. But in his summer camps for high-school students, only 15 to 20 percent are girls. \"Something weird is happening early in high school,\" he says. \"Stereotypes are being formed about gender roles and career goals.\" Experts on the gender gap in computer science have increasingly come to believe that a multipronged strategy is needed to close it. The tactics would include the following: More-diverse programming activities, to seize the interest of middle-school girls, in the same way that role-playing video games are embraced by boys. A revamped introductory course, whether taken in college or as an Advanced Placement course in high school, to provide a broad overview of the real-world applications of computer science. Early exposure to research projects during the first year of college. (Ms. Lamm was paired with her mentor, Mr. Gray, during her first month at Alabama.) Opportunities for undergraduates to interact with women who have enjoyed successful careers in technology. Efforts to increase the number of women remain disjointed, however, even after a decade of attention to the issue. \"The biggest challenge is that everyone is doing their own thing, and no one is connecting,\" says Rane Johnson-Stempson, who leads Microsoft's efforts to get more women interested in computer science and research. The company is providing grants of $10,000 to $35,000 to colleges that develop collaborations with local nonprofit groups, community colleges, and schools. Girls are less likely to play video games, hence less likely to tinker with the inner workings of computers at a young age, says Barbara Ericson, who heads the Georgia Institute of Technology's efforts to get more young girls interested in computer science. Women earned only 8 percent of computer-science degrees awarded by Georgia Tech in 2012. Ms. Ericson holds summer camps for girls and workshops for Girl Scouts that allow them to create animations, stories, and games through easy-to-use programming languages like Alice and Scratch. Leah Buechley, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, meanwhile, has created a kit that allows girls to program \"wearable computers\" that can be sewn into clothes and made to produce sound and light with microchips. \"There's no one silver bullet for getting girls interested,\" Ms. Ericson says. The colleges that have had the most success have remodeled their first-year courses in computer science, or added new versions, to create a better experience for women. Harvey Mudd College has tripled its proportion of women in computer science\u2014about 38 percent of the majors now\u2014since redesigning its introductory course six years ago. The new class offers a variety of ways for students to explore course content. They can \"computationally interact\" with images, sounds, or biological data, says Zachary Dodds, an associate professor of computer science. \"If you're a student who loves math, or physics, or biology, or media, there's something for you,\" he says. The National Science Foundation and the College Board are leading an effort to create an Advanced Placement course that will provide a broad overview of computer science, with only a small dose of writing code. The current AP course in computer science teaches programming in the Java language, which can be difficult for beginners. Just under 20 percent of students who take the AP exam in computer science are women\u2014among the lowest percentages of all AP courses. The NSF spends $15-million per year to modernize computing education, and much of it helps train math and science teachers so that they can gain skills needed to teach the new AP course. The agency's goal is to have 10,000 teachers prepared to teach it by 2016. In a trial version of the AP course in 25 public schools in Los Angeles, 41 percent of the 2,000 students were women. The push to revamp is also affecting introductory courses at colleges. At the University of California at Berkeley, where 20 percent of computer-science majors are women, a new course for nonmajors, \"Beauty and Joy of Computing,\" emphasizes computer science's potential to change the world. It features guest lectures by an executive at Pandora, the music-streaming company, and experts on artificial intelligence. An AP version\u2014one of several pilot versions of the new course under development\u2014is expected to be offered at the high-school level. About 45 percent of the students taking the Berkeley course are women, up from 30 percent before the revamp, says Dan Garcia, the senior lecturer who created the course. Women are also doing better, earning an average grade of B-plus, compared with a B for the men. \"You don't need a dad who was a programmer to succeed in this course,\" Mr. Garcia says. Some computer-science departments are venturing elsewhere on their campuses to make a pitch for their major. At Indiana University at Bloomington, for example, the nursing program is so popular that even students with strong grades sometimes don't gain admission. The university's School of Informatics and Computing encourages those women to consider majoring in informatics, or \"the application of information technology to the arts, sciences, and professions.\" Informatics majors can choose to earn the equivalent of a minor in health, setting them up for a quick path to a nursing degree after graduation, should they choose. \"We're always looking for strategic ways to interest people in coming into the program,\" says Maureen Biggers, assistant dean for diversity and education. The number of women majoring in informatics at Indiana has doubled within two years, to 150 students, or 18 percent of all the majors. Another plus for computer-science recruiting: At a time when the economy remains shaky, new computer-science graduates are the most likely among all majors to have received a job offer, and their median starting salary, $56,000, is second only to that of engineering graduates. Experts say that the economic benefits of majoring in computer science rarely resonate with young women, but that older, returning students are more receptive to the message. Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, in North Carolina, won a $200,000 grant from the NSF in September to recruit more women into its computing programs. Women currently account for 9 to 17 percent of enrollment in the programs. Pamela Silvers, chair of the department of business-computer technologies, thinks she can boost those proportions to 45 percent or better within a few years by traveling to Asheville's many outdoor festivals and promoting the financial benefits that a career in computing can provide. She believes the programs will prove popular among single mothers. \"These are careers in which you can get a job and pay your bills,\" Ms. Silvers says. At the University of Texas at Austin, the computer-science department's free, weeklong summer camp for high-school girls entering their junior or senior year also serves as a recruiting tool. All 60 attendees are offered $1,000 scholarships for the first year if they choose to enroll and study computer science at the university. In 2011, 11 of the former campers accepted the offer, and this fall another seven did. The proportion of female majors in the freshman class is now 19 percent, compared with 16 percent among all computer-science majors. Texas also provides expenses-paid trips for 20 women to attend the annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, held this year in Baltimore in early October. The university, like many other institutions, receives corporate support to cover the cost of the trips. The Chronicle of Higher Education | by Ben Gose Harvey Mudd, too, sends a large group of women to the conference. The idea is that they will be more likely to persevere and earn a degree if they see the successful careers of an earlier generation of women. But for spurring interest in the major, nothing beats a pitch from someone close to your own age. Jonecia Keels did well at programming at her high school in Timber Pines, Fla., but planned to major in psychology when she arrived at Spelman College. \"In my high-school class, I was the only female and the only minority,\" she says. \"Bill Gates, Steve Jobs\u2014all the influential people in the field didn't look like me.\" During her first month at Spelman, she saw a presentation by the SpelBots, the college's women's robotics team. That hooked her on computer science. She and a friend joined the team and spent so much time programming the robots\u2014the team won international awards for its efforts to get them to dance or play soccer\u2014that they began calling the computing lab their \"dorm room.\" Ms. Keels earned a degree in computer engineering from Columbia University last May, after completing a dual-degree program offered through Spelman. She started at Apple in August, as a computer engineer working on iOS, the company's mobile operating system. She owes it all, she says, to her first glimpse of those SpelBots back in 2007. \"I'm super grateful,\" she says. \"If I hadn't seen that, I wouldn't have considered computer science as a major.\" News Categories Outreach Tags careers",

Actually she welcomes them. After wanting more out of her education, she added computer science as a second major. She has studied abroad in Spain and performed research here in the College of Natural Sciences. She is also serving on the Dean\u2019s Scholars council as the elected Dean\u2019s Scholars Chair. I chatted with Kannan to learn about her research, her leadership experiences and how her two degrees meld. So why did you decide to come to the College of Natural Sciences all those years ago? Honestly, the Dean\u2019s Scholars program is one of the main reasons I came to UT. I applied to the program and then came to a weekend at UT to learn more about it. I immediately fell in love. It was what I imagined college would be like. It\u2019s everything I want a college to be. What is the best part of Dean\u2019s Scholars? If you meet someone who is also a Dean\u2019s Scholar you immediately know you will get along. It\u2019s like you knew them all along. It is just a great way to make friends, study groups and connections. So you did a study abroad program. How was that experience? I did the evolution program in Spain. It is hard to explain my abroad experience to someone who hasn\u2019t done it. Studying abroad was a remarkable experience that I will never forget. Hands down, if you have the opportunity to do it you should! What spurred you to add computer science as a second major? Starting my sophomore year I didn\u2019t feel as if I was being challenged. I took a computational biology class, which is very accessible to biology majors, and knew I wanted to get more into computer science. Why do you feel the double major will be valuable? So much of biology is moving toward new technology on a much larger scale. We can no longer use small data sets. It is so much more valuable to use large amounts of data, and computer science can help us extrapolate unparalleled amounts of information. Do you find yourself studying differently for the two majors? It is really interesting how basic things such as studying are different between the two majors. My learning in biology is so much more passive, while in computer science it is active and I learn by doing. What kind of research are you interested in? I am really interested in immunology and metabolic diseases. It would be very revealing to look at various people\u2019s genomes and look at how they are predisposed to certain diseases. With high output sequencing you can harvest so much data and use computer science and statistics to dissect that data. Research of that kind is being done already and I find it really fascinating. Do you find you are different than other computer science majors since you were a biology major first? I am very different from my peers in CS. They have this thing where they always have to be right. They aren\u2019t afraid to argue with each other or even professors. It is very interesting. I think it\u2019s great. They push me so much. They are a very driven group. Tags Student Life Computer Science Main Page Biology Q&A",

As a result, business leaders constantly seek better information to give them competitive edge and help them manage their businesses. With the maturing of the Information Age, data is generated in volumes that were all but inconceivable just a few short years ago. Internal systems, vendor systems, telephone systems and the Web generate data at dizzying speeds. The challenge is to turn the data into the information that companies can use and leaders seek. In a company like General Motors , much of that responsibility falls in the hands of its IT department. Working with those systems and volumes of data requires a constant focus on deriving more quality information from them and building innovative new solutions. Recognizing the company\u2019s needs, GM IT has already opened two Innovation Centers (with two more to come) to gather the brightest minds together to build these solutions. Those minds will need to have broad knowledge of business principles, the ability to see connections between work that exists in different business areas, and the creativity and motivation to deliver capabilities Many companies, including GM, see those skills being developed in universities across the land. Exposure to the many business disciplines combined with the critical focus on information systems concepts creates the type of key talent that GM seeks to bring into their Innovation Centers. For GM, innovation is how IT supports the business in rolling out the best vehicles and enabling the best performance. Partnering with top universities to train and recruit the best students is one key way in which GM IT will ensure success in its mission to increase the focus on IT innovation.

Grant Willson and S.V. Sreenivasan received the Inventor of the Year award Thursday for developing a nanolithography process used for manufacturing computer chips, hard drives and other electronic components. They took their research beyond the laboratory in co-founding Molecular Imprints Inc., an Austin-based company with more than 100 employees. \u201cI congratulate Professor Sreenivasan and Professor Willson for their momentous contributions to society, the full scope of which we won\u2019t know for many decades to come,\u201d said Bill Powers, president of the university. \u201cI also honor the efforts of all the university\u2019s many inventors. It is never more evident than on occasions like this that what starts here changes the world.\u201d Willson and Sreenivasan received the award at a reception where UT Austin researchers who received patents during the year were also recognized. The university\u2019s Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC) in the Office of the Vice President for Research organized the event. Dan Sharp, interim OTC director, said the Inventor of the Year is chosen on the basis of the significance and novelty of a scientific discovery coupled with the commercial potential of the discovery. \u201cThis program recognizes and honors them and the researchers and inventors at UT Austin and the great work that they perform in our labs,\u201d he said. The university received $20.3 million in licensing revenue in 2011-2012, and its researchers received 80 patents, making it one of the largest contributors of technology and innovation in the state. The technology that Willson, a chemist and engineer, and Sreenivasan, a mechanical engineer, developed is a more cost-effective high-resolution printing technique used to make very high-resolution patterns used in the semiconductor and other industries. The process could help manufacturers overcome some of the physical barriers involved in reducing the size of circuits in computer chips and other devices. Besides their extensive research portfolios, Sreenivasan and Willson teach undergraduate and graduate classes. Willson is a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in the College of Natural Sciences and the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering in the Cockrell School of Engineering. In 2007 Willson, the Rashid Engineering Regents Chair, received the National Medal for Technology and Innovation from President George W. Bush. He received the SWS Teaching Excellence Award in Chemical Engineering in 2006. He came to The University of Texas at Austin in 1993 after a 17-year career at IBM Corp., where he was an IBM Fellow. At IBM, Willson managed a large group of researchers who were developing new polymers for microelectronics, and his interest in that continued at the university. His research focuses on the design and synthesis of functional organic materials, with emphasis on materials for microelectronics. His research group includes graduate and undergraduate students from natural science and engineering. Sreenivasan is a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the Cockrell School and the Eli H. and Ramona Thornton Centennial Fellow in Engineering. In 2010 he received the O\u2019Donnell Award for Technology Innovation conferred by the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas. Sreenivasan is also the chief technical officer and a member of the board of directors of Molecular Imprints and continues to provide strategic technical and business leadership. During the past decade, Sreenivasan has mentored graduate research students who have been hired by Molecular Imprints. Tags Honors &amp; Awards Main Page Research Chemistry Computer Science",

Students in the computer science honors program, Turing Scholars, are among the nation\u2019s most talented, and many of them turn down offers from schools such as MIT, Stanford, and the University of Washington each year to attend UT Austin. Unfortunately, many other students who are admitted choose to attend these other institutions instead, and often, a key consideration is the matter of cost. Seven of the nation\u2019s top computer science programs are found at private institutions, most of which saw their scholarship endowments more than double in size during the last decade. At the same time, The University of Texas, one of only three public schools in the top ten, has seen its tuition rise significantly in response to repeated budget cuts from reduced state allocations. The end result? It\u2019s not uncommon for a student who is qualified to be admitted to both a school like Stanford and UT\u2019s Turing Scholars Program see a lower net cost at Stanford than UT Austin, even if that student is a Texas resident. Fortunately, some individuals are stepping up to fill the need. One of those individuals is a generous alumnus of the Turing program himself, who recently established a scholarship dedicated to supporting students in the Turing Honors Program. In addition to establishing that scholarship, he has agreed to match any additional contributions made by other donors in support of Turing scholarships if the gift is given before December 31, 2012. For those alumni and friends of the school who feel passionate about making a direct impact on student\u2019s lives, this is a unique opportunity to double the impact of their gifts. Despite the challenging nature of funding these scholarships, it is especially gratifying to see alumni recognize the need for this cause and step forward in support of these talented young scholars. Make a gift to the Turing Scholarship fund. News Categories Undergraduate Students Alumni Tags Turing",

UT-Austin is excelling among its Tier One peers in many areas of undergraduate education, according to a report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Texas Coalition for Excellence in Higher Education. Speaking to Alcalde, McLendon said he was impressed that UT has created highly innovative teaching programs while maintaining a tradition of excellence in research. Universities that conduct large amounts of research\u2014also know as Tier One universities\u2014must balance scientific and artistic discovery with the overarching mission of teaching and learning. Measuring success in those roles has been the crux of an ongoing debate over higher education in Texas. The ninety-six-page academic study, authored by Southern Methodist University\u2019s Michael McLendon, finds Texas\u2019 two Tier One schools\u2014UT-Austin and Texas A&M\u2014ahead of peer institutions in the areas of bachelor\u2019s degree production, student engagement, and innovative undergraduate education, like UT\u2019s Course Transformation Program and First Year Signature Courses. Speaking to Alcalde, McLendon said he was impressed that UT has created highly innovative teaching programs while maintaining a tradition of excellence in research. The study is titled, \u201cCommitted to Excellence: An Assessment of the Conditions and Outcomes of Undergraduate Education at the University of Texas at Austin and at Texas A&M University.\u201d In it, the sister schools also get high marks in graduation rates among Hispanic students and student satisfaction. Affordability and value, two of higher education\u2019s biggest areas of recent focus, were also lauded. The study notes that while state support has decreased and tuition increased, the total cost to UT students is still roughly $1,000 less than the average of their peers. The study notes that while state support has decreased and tuition risen, the total cost to UT students is still roughly $1,000 less than the average of their peers. There\u2019s still room for improvement, according to the report. Both universities are found lagging in enrollment and graduation rates among African-American students and in overall four-year graduation rate among its national peers, though they lead the state\u2019s public universities in graduation rates. McLendon and his research team compiled data from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s IPEDs database and the National Survey of Student Engagement, both nationwide projects that allowed comparison against the country\u2019s most respected research universities. The report\u2019s aim is to clarify the mission and value of Texas\u2019 Tier One universities, and determine their success in educating undergraduates. The Coalition commissioned the report in the hope that it will become a tool for legislators with a plethora of higher education issues to contend with in the 2013 session. Evidence of success in student outcomes bodes well for UT, as legislators and administrators prepare for a move to a outcomes-based model of state funding. State House higher education chair Dan Branch (R-Dallas) has filed legislation to tie up to 25 percent of base university funding to outcomes like graduation rates. Leaders in the state Senate and Higher Education Coordinating Board also support these metrics, developed in consultation with public universities. \u201cThis report confirms what we know to be true\u2014that UT-Austin and Texas A&M provide outstanding educations,\u201d UT president Bill Powers said in a press release. \u201cThe report also raises legitimate concerns\u2014such as four-year graduation rates and African-American enrollment\u2014that we share and are working hard to address.\u201d UT-Austin has seen some growth [PDF] in African-American enrollment under the current admissions policies that combines the state\u2019s Top Ten Percent Law and the review process called holistic admission. That process is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The University has also committed to raising its four-year graduation rate to 70 percent by 2016.

    "text_content": "Physicists Take Photonic Topological Insulators to the Next Level | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Physicists Take Photonic Topological Insulators to the Next Level Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, December 21, 2012 AUSTIN, Texas\u2014Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have designed a simulation that for the first time emulates key properties of electronic topological insulators. Their simulation, which was described this week in Nature Materials , is part of a rapidly moving scientific race to understand and exploit the potential of topological insulators , which are a state of matter that was only discovered in the past decade. These insulators may enable dramatic advances in quantum computing and spintronics. \u201cThe discovery of these materials, which are insulators in their volume while capable of conducting current on their surface, was a bit of a surprise to the condensed matter community,\u201d said Gennady Shvets , professor of physics in the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cBefore that, we classified solid materials into three categories, based on their ability to conduct electric current: insulators, conductors, and semiconductors. Topological insulators fall somewhere in between.\u201d Shvets co-authored the article with his physics department colleagues Alexander Khanikaev, S. Hossein Mousavi, Wang-Kong Tse, Mehdi Kargarian, and Professor Allan MacDonald. He said that what\u2019s particularly exciting about topological insulators is that they can conduct electrons\u2014or in the case of photonic ones, photons\u2014in a way that protects them from scattering or reflecting when they encounter obstacles. \u201cUsually when photons run into an obstacle, they reflect,\u201d said Shvets. \u201cWe are basically designing interfaces in such a way that they lock photons into one spin state. So in one direction they\u2019re in one spin state, and when they\u2019re going in another direction they\u2019re locked into another spin state. In that configuration they cannot reflect without changing their spin, which is forbidden by the design of the photonic crystal. They flow around defects and can be routed along arbitrarily shaped paths defined by the interface.\u201d If this property could be achieved with electrons it would be particularly relevant to quantum computers , which are likely to require their electrons to maintain coherence for a much longer time than digital computers. Over the past decade scientists have had modest success making or finding electronic topological insulators. But these substances are limited both in what they can do and in what they can reveal about the potential of this new state of matter. \u201cThose systems are very difficult to study systematically, because when you have a real material it is what it is. You\u2019re limited to studying its properties,\u201d said Shvets. \u201cNature doesn\u2019t give you the knobs to increase or decrease various aspects of it, so it\u2019s very difficult to benchmark the existing theories against what\u2019s observed.\u201d Shvets and his physics department colleagues expect that their simulated photonic insulator will be a much more powerful and flexible tool for studying the general properties of topological insulators. \u201cWith these purely artificial photonic crystals, we can study these systems in a more systematic way,\u201d he said. In order for their insights from the photonic system to be applicable to electronic systems, Shvets and his colleagues had to make their simulated photons behave sufficiently like electrons. To do that, they designed simulated \u201c metamaterials .\u201d These are artificial electromagnetic materials that can be tuned to influence photons in ways that are otherwise impossible. Other metamaterials are being used to develop invisibility cloaks . Shvets and his colleagues designed what they\u2019ve called SPINDOMs (spin-degenerate optically-active metamaterials). When arranged periodically, the resulting meta-crystals are the first demonstration that it\u2019s possible to control the spin of photons in a way that emulates what can be done with electrons. This is significant on a few fronts. Even as a computer simulation it allows researchers to explore the properties of topological insulators. When these photonic topological insulators are physically built, as Shvets and his colleagues hope will be done soon, they\u2019ll allow more exploration. And there\u2019s great promise that such insulators may eventually be used to reduce interference in wireless communications systems. \u201cRight now if you put multiple emitting or receiving antennas in close proximity to each other, whether on a semiconductor chip or on top of a cellular base station, the radiation from each antenna is affected by the others,\u201d he said. \u201cTo deal with this you have to design around it. What would be better is if all cross talk between emitting/receiving sources could just be eliminated. That\u2019s what we believe could be done by photonic topological insulators, which can directionally guide electromagnetic waves.\u201d News Categories Press Release Research Tags Physics Theoretical Computer Science Quantum Computing",

We are approaching just such a milestone. For many months now, we have been awaiting the department\u2019s move into our new home:  the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall (GDC). That move is nearly here. I am distinctly happy to report that by this time next month, our doors will be open, and UTCS will have all of its faculty, staff, and students under a single roof for the first time in the department\u2019s history. It is hard to overstate the impact that GDC will have on the quality on the classroom experiences, the ability of our faculty to conduct research, and the collaborative experience and community of the department as a whole. The timing of the completion of this project is in some sense symbolic. GDC gives the department a new external face to show the world at a time when it is also experiencing remarkable internal growth and evolution.  Fall 2012 marked the implementation of one of the most extensive undergraduate curriculum overhauls in departmental history, which will better position our students for success in both graduate school and today\u2019s job market. We will need both a modern curriculum and our new facilities to accommodate the explosive growth of the past several years. Nearly 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students will join us in GDC\u2014double our enrollment from only five years ago. Clearly, this is a moment for to celebrate not only a new home, but also a bright future for UTCS. We intend to do just that. Expect an invitation early next spring with all of the details on our grand opening, >goto_GDC; where we\u2019ll invite all of our alumni and the general public to campus to experience the Gates Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall first-hand. It will be an event you won\u2019t want to miss! Hook \u2019em, Bruce Porter, UTCS Chair",

    "text_content": "Game Development Program | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Game Development Program Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, December 7, 2012 The gaming industry is one of the fastest growing intersections of entertainment, art, and technology. It now generates more revenue than the music industry and film box-office receipts. Texas has the second largest concentration of game studios in the U.S., and as mobile, online, and social platforms improve, more opportunities will arise.  Within the Texas gaming infrastructure, Austin alone produces more than $1 billion in gaming centered economic impact and houses in excess of 100 gaming studios\u2014more than the rest of the state combined. Arguably, a world-class game development program that can support and take advantage of the Austin game scene is both natural and overdue. To meet this need, Computer Science , Radio-Television-Film , and Fine Arts began offering classes in fall 2011 through the Game Development Program.  UT\u2019s leadership intentionally did not create a degree program\u2014an action driven by the fact that UT can respond more effectively to market needs through an interdisciplinary process that reflects the nature of the industry itself. The Game Development Program educates students for careers in and creative leadership for interactive media companies, especially game studios. The program is richly synergistic, real-world-project driven, team-structured, and cooperatively designed by UT faculty and industry representatives. In fact, local gaming companies like BioWare, Portalarium, Zynga, and others are committed to evaluating student portfolios and hiring successful graduates. Participating students learn game development skills within each of the following degree programs: art and music (College of Fine Arts), networking, distributed systems, and programming (Computer Science), and animation and visual effects (Radio-Television-Film). During their time at UT Austin, students, working individually and in teams, create portfolio pieces and digital games. The culminating class of the Game Development Program is the capstone course, usually taken in the senior year. Associate Director Paul Toprac relied on competitive admissions to assemble thirty students from different disciplines to work in small groups developing digital games for the spring 2013 inaugural class. The coursework reflects the realities of the industry: students with diverse talents will have to work collaboratively to create meld art and science into an actual, functioning game by the semester\u2019s end.

The winners were announced this month at the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games. \u201cThe idea is to evaluate how we can make game bots, which are nonplayer characters (NPCs) controlled by AI algorithms, appear as human as possible,\u201d said Risto Miikkulainen , professor of computer science in the College of Natural Sciences. Miikkulainen created the bot, called the UT^2 game bot, with doctoral students Jacob Schrum and Igor Karpov. The bots face off in a tournament against one another and about an equal number of humans, with each player trying to score points by eliminating its opponents. Each player also has a \u201cjudging gun\u201d in addition to its usual complement of weapons. That gun is used to tag opponents as human or bot. The bot that is scored as most human-like by the human judges is named the winner. UT^2, which won a warm-up competition last month, shared the honors with MirrorBot, which was programmed by Romanian computer scientist Mihai Polceanu. The winning bots both achieved a humanness rating of 52 percent. Human players received an average humanness rating of only 40 percent. The two winning teams will split the $7,000 first prize. The victory comes 100 years after the birth of mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, whose \u201c Turing test \u201d stands as one of the foundational definitions of what constitutes true machine intelligence. Turing argued that we will never be able to see inside a machine\u2019s hypothetical consciousness, so the best measure of machine sentience is whether it can fool us into believing it is human. \u201cWhen this \u2018Turing test for game bots\u2019 competition was started, the goal was 50 percent humanness,\u201d said Miikkulainen. \u201cIt took us five years to get there, but that level was finally reached last week, and it\u2019s not a fluke.\u201d The complex gameplay and 3-D environments of \u201cUnreal Tournament 2004\u2033 require that bots mimic humans in a number of ways, including moving around in 3-D space, engaging in chaotic combat against multiple opponents and reasoning about the best strategy at any given point in the game. Even displays of distinctively human irrational behavior can, in some cases, be emulated. \u201cPeople tend to tenaciously pursue specific opponents without regard for optimality,\u201d said Schrum. \u201cWhen humans have a grudge, they\u2019ll chase after an enemy even when it\u2019s not in their interests. We can mimic that behavior.\u201d In order to most convincingly mimic as much of the range of human behavior as possible, the team takes a two-pronged approach. Some behavior is modeled directly on previously observed human behavior, while the central battle behaviors are developed through a process called neuroevolution , which runs artificially intelligent neural networks through a survival-of-the-fittest gauntlet that is modeled on the biological process of evolution. Networks that thrive in a given environment are kept, and the less fit are thrown away. The holes in the population are filled by copies of the fit ones and by their \u201coffspring,\u201d which are created by randomly modifying (mutating) the survivors. The simulation is run for as many generations as are necessary for networks to emerge that have evolved the desired behavior. \u201cIn the case of the BotPrize,\u201d said Schrum, \u201ca great deal of the challenge is in defining what \u2018human-like\u2019 is, and then setting constraints upon the neural networks so that they evolve toward that behavior. \u201cIf we just set the goal as eliminating one\u2019s enemies, a bot will evolve toward having perfect aim, which is not very human-like. So we impose constraints on the bot\u2019s aim, such that rapid movements and long distances decrease accuracy. By evolving for good performance under such behavioral constraints, the bot\u2019s skill is optimized within human limitations, resulting in behavior that is good but still human-like.\u201d Miikkulainen said that methods developed for the BotPrize competition should eventually be useful not just in developing games that are more entertaining, but also in creating virtual training environments that are more realistic, and even in building robots that interact with humans in more pleasant and effective ways.

Players often enjoy playing against other humans, because it provides a more interesting game experience. The goal of the competition is to promote more research in human-like bots, as well as evaluate how well we are currently doing in this area.\u201d The Humanlike Bot Competition focuses on interactions in the Unreal Tournament 2004 videogame, which is a fast-paced first-person shooter game. There are complex 3D environments in which multiple players and bots battle each other with different weapons and abilities. Humanlike behavior involves actions like moving around in the 3D space, engaging opponents, and choosing weapons. The UTCS team has participated in all six competitions since 2008. Over time, their bot design has changed significantly. To help guide their research and improvements, they ran a human subject study to determine what human judges base their decisions on. The winning entry consisted of a prioritized list of behaviors such as getting unstuck, shooting at the enemy, picking up an object, and running around the environment. The simplest of these behaviors were designed by hand, as scripts, but the most complex behaviors were learned using human traces and neuroevolution. The getting-unstuck and running-around behaviors were based on traces of actual human behavior. The team collected transcripts of many games, and indexed and stored them. During the game, when a getting-unstuck or running-around behavior is called for, they matched the current situation with the database and executed behaviors that humans found appropriate in similar situations. The general idea was to learn to map these two behaviors from situations to human actions that would then apply to novel situations as well. The battle behavior was learned using neuroevolution. Neural networks were used to control the movement, weapon selection, and shooting during close combat with an opponent. Instead of training the network using human behavior as targets, the team used evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms) to search for a network that would perform well. \u201cIn this case we found that a network that was evolved to be good also acted much like humans do, so a secondary objective of being similar to recorded human traces was not necessary,\u201d explains Risto. The UT^2 bot is the first winning bot in the history of the Humanlike Bot Competition to be judged as human more often than half the human players participating in the evaluation. \u201cThat is a significant milestone in the competition,\u201d says Miikkulainen. \u201cWhile in the first several competitions, there was a persistent gap between all humans and all bots, that gap has now closed. \u201cThere is still much we can improve, and the competition will continue, with the next one scheduled for later this year.\u201d For more information contact : Risto Miikkulainen, Department of Computer Science, (512) 471-9571, risto@cs.utexas.edu .

    "text_content": "GM to bring 500 IT jobs to Austin | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content GM to bring 500 IT jobs to Austin Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, September 7, 2012 KXAN | Chris Sadeghi Automaker to ramp up fledgling tech center AUSTIN (AP/KXAN) - General Motors, which is shifting computer technology functions into the company from outside firms, plans to open a new information technology center in Austin that will staffed by at least 500 people. The Austin center will be the first of four in the nation and is already open with a handful of people, and hiring will ramp up gradually as GM finds the right workers to fill the jobs, the company said Friday. GM has an assembly plant in Arlington. It's all part of a move to bring 90 percent of GM's information technology from outside companies in-house, which GM believes will make the company more nimble and efficient. GM could add as many as 10,000 people to do the work globally in the next three to five years, said Randy Mott, the company's new chief information officer. \"We are changing the mix very substantially to have a lot more people doing development and innovation,\" Mott said on a morning conference call. The positions would have to be self-supporting, an investment with a return that helps GM cut information technology costs and bring changes that would boost market share and revenue, Mott said. The innovation centers would develop software and change processes to help GM bring new vehicles to market faster, he said. \"Every area of our company is in the midst of transforming,\" Mott said. Currently most of GM's information technology is contracted out to other companies, spokeswoman Julie Huston-Rough said. The work now done in-house focuses on keeping the company running rather than new technology, she said. GM is talking with other cities about the remaining three U.S. sites, and it would not reveal which areas are candidates. Government tax incentives were not part of the decision to locate in Austin, but it's something GM continues to look at as it opens the centers, Mott said. The automaker said Friday that it is hiring software developers, project managers, database experts and business analysts in Austin, which was picked because it has a ready workforce with the skills General Motors Co. is looking for. The Austin metropolitan area is home to a growing technology community that includes the University of Texas at Austin and computer maker Dell Inc. GM says its information technology innovation centers will help to get breakthrough ideas into the company's cars and trucks. It's also intended to improve GM's business processes and drive down costs. Huston-Rough says the new technology centers are separate from a GM plan now under way to consolidate its 23 global data centers into two in an effort to cut costs and increase speed and efficiency. GM shares rose 52 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $22.97 in Friday morning trading. In July the carmaker's stock hit $18.72, its lowest level since selling for $33 in an initial public offering almost two years ago. But the shares have risen recently. The Austin Chamber of Commerce said discussions with GM began in May and hiring is expected to begin soon. The announcement brought excitement at The University of Texas Computer Science Department where students are being groomed to join the Austin workforce that GM found so attractive. \"We are eager to find ways to partner with them,\" said CS Chair Bruce Porter.

The CAREER awards recognize promising young faculty and supports their research with five years of funding. Andrew Blumberg , an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, will use his $80,927 in funding to advance our current understanding of the bridge between algebra and high-dimensional geometry. The proposed research will have impact on mathematical physics, particularly the study of topological field theories and string theory. The educational program will enhance the development of mathematically trained undergraduates and will leverage the university\u2019s existing strengths in recruiting talented undergraduates from traditionally under-represented groups. Dionicio Siegel , an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, will examine new ways to promote neural regeneration through the use of small molecules that are either derived from, or mimic the structure of, natural products. With his $200,000 in funding he will also help fund his research class \u201cBioprospecting: Isolation of Biologically Active Natural Products from Endophytes,\u201d which exposes students to a unique combination of botany, ethnobotany, mycology, pharmacology, and organic chemistry. Shalene Jha , an assistant professor in the Section of Integrative Biology, will use her $690,415 in funding to develop the first spatially and temporally explicit population model for native pollinators, specifically bees, in a human-altered landscape. The program will also be carried out through a synergistic integration of research and teaching activities, including enhanced undergraduate involvement in the lab and field, collaboration with K-12 teachers, development of a graduate-level course in landscape genetics, and a series of public outreach seminars and workshops. Pradeep Ravikumar , an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, will use his $91,333 in funding to develop \u201cneat\u201d mathematically rigorous approaches to highly complex artificial intelligence and machine learning problems that have more typically been addressed through \u201cscruffy\u201d methods. The research should impacts problems across science and engineering wherever statistical machine learning approaches are being used, such as genomics, natural language processing and image analysis, to name a few. Thomas Chen , an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, will use his $416,231 in funding to address issues in the areas of quantum field theory, non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics, and Hamiltonian dynamics. The educational component of his project will involve the training of graduate students in highly multidisciplinary annual thematic programs that provide them with a integrative and specialized understanding of links between analysis, applied and computational mathematics, nonlinear PDE\u2019s, and mathematical physics. Andrew Neitzke , an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, will use his $50,244 in funding to continue his cutting edge exploration of the mathematical applications of N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theory. This work has recently led to quite unexpected connections between physics and mathematical subjects such as enumerative geometry, hyperkahler geometry, and cluster algebras, and hence also to purely mathematical connections between these subjects. He will also produce a library of video clips explaining concepts from physics for mathematicians at a variety of levels, from the undergraduate level to other researchers. These clips will be freely available over the web. Tags Honors &amp; Awards News Releases Research Top News Biology Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Computer Science Integrative Biology Mathematics",

    "text_content": "Robot Sport: Heavy Hitters | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Robot Sport: Heavy Hitters Posted by Staci R Norman on Saturday, July 21, 2012 The Economist | from the print edition Sporting robots are still slow. But their inventors are making rapid strides ONLY a few of the many thousands who applied to carry Britain\u2019s Olympic torch in the relay that finishes on July 27th made the final selection. But one application (albeit unsuccessful) stood out. James Law, a computer scientist at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales, nominated iCub, his metre-high humanoid robot. Competition to build athletic machines is intensifying as greater processing power makes them nimbler and handier. Disembodied arms at the University of Tokyo pitch baseballs, and bat them back, with uncanny accuracy. Engineers in Munich have built a pool-playing automaton that can pot five balls in a row. Their counterparts at Zhejiang University in China boast a pair of humanoid table-tennis players. (They can rally with a human for 145 strokes, and with each other for about 180.) Sporting robots delight schoolchildren and excite students, says Peter Stone, an academic in Austin, Texas, who helps to organise the RoboCup\u2014an annual competition for robot footballers. But they also spur innovation. The same software that helps miniature robots form sports teams could co-ordinate larger rescue robots in a disaster zone. Games that require robots to take humanoid form spur research into machines that might one day care for the elderly or run errands for the infirm. Some sporting robots have more immediate practical uses. Robotic arms that hit perfect drives help golfing firms produce ever-better clubs. A martial-arts robot at Loughborough University batters prototype protective sports gear. The United States Bowling Congress uses a machine named E.A.R.L. to measure whether ten-pin facilities are up to scratch. These appliances are valued for their consistency, but uncanny precision is a disadvantage in a real game. E.A.R.L. gets less precise over ten frames (its ball wears out the surface of the lane by always hitting the same spot). Even \u201cageing amateurs\u201d can defeat today\u2019s batch of footballing automatons, admits Mr Stone. But cleverer breeds of robot will learn from watching humans, thinks Subramanian Ramamoorthy at the University of Edinburgh. New technologies are generating ever more data about flesh-and-blood sportsmen\u2014much of which might be fed into machines. Basketballs made by 94Fifty, an American start-up, are packed with sensors which measure how accurately players pass, dribble and shoot. Cameras owned by SportVU, an Israeli firm, identify and monitor players on sports fields. The company uses missile-tracking software to crunch the huge array of statistics that their moves provide. Such omniscience could make artificial athletes unbeatable\u2014if their hardware were up to scratch. But without wheels, most automatons are still painfully slow. The tiny athletes who took part in the world\u2019s first robot marathon, in Osaka, took more than two days to finish the course. Usain Bolt, the world\u2019s fastest man, reaches 28 miles (44km) per hour; but the fastest robot on legs, a doglike creature built by Boston Dynamics, runs at only around 18mph. The swiftest two-legged machines, like one built by scientists at the University of Michigan, now travel at about 7mph. That is about the speed of a jogging human. iCub\u2019s successors may gain revenge eventually: entrants in the RoboCup hope their teams could beat humans by 2050. For now their machines have more brains than brawn\u2014though at least they have no penchant for embarrassing partying when the games are over.

In broad subject categories The University of Texas at Austin was No. 5 in engineering, technology and computer science. It joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the top five. The university was No. 15 in social sciences and No. 32 in natural sciences and mathematics. The University of Texas at Austin has maintained this level of excellence while receiving less state funding and charging lower tuition than most of its peer public research universities in the United States. In specific fields the university ranked No. 9 in computer science , No. 15 in mathematics, No. 20 in economics and business, No. 24 in chemistry and No. 35 in physics. The university ranked No. 27 among U.S. universities. Other Texas universities in the top 100 overall are: University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, No. 48; Rice University, No. 91; and Texas A&M University, No. 93. The ranking is based on six indicators: the number of alumni and staff members winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals, the number of highly cited researchers selected by Thomson Scientific, the number of articles published in the journals Nature and Science, the number of articles indexed in Science Citation Index-Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index and per capita performance with respect to the size of an institution. The Center for World-Class Universities is based at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Earlier this year, the Center for World University Rankings, based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, ranked The University of Texas at Austin No. 30 in its list of the world's top 100 universities. Times Higher Education, the United Kingdom\u2019s leading higher education publication, ranks UT Austin 29th in the world. News Categories Awards & Honors Graduate Program Undergraduate Program",

    "text_content": "Computer Science Combats Disease | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Science Combats Disease Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, July 25, 2012 By David Maly , The Daily Texan , 7/18/2012 Computer science professor Chandrajit Bajaj and his team of researchers have developed new software capable of determining which compounds will best treat diseases using less information than was previously required. Bajaj said this could lead to new developments in the fight against serious diseases including Machupo virus, dengue fever and HIV. Prior to this software, determining possible cures for a disease would have normally required the 3-D atomistic model of both the target and associated protein cells of a virus. Because those models aren\u2019t currently available for various diseases, past research has been difficult. Bajaj\u2019s new software, however, can use the simpler 3-D quasi-atomistic model of those cells to determine possible cures. Bajaj said this is possible through the use of his improved algorithms for the image reconstruction and modeling of cells. Now, researchers can use the improved algorithms to study the necessary detail on the 3-D quasi-atomistic cell model needed to determine which drugs are most likely prevent or treat a disease. Prior to the improved algorithms, that detail could only be appropriately studied on the more advanced 3-D atomistic model, which is less available. In a February 2012 paper in the Journal of Structural Biology by Bajaj, research associate Qin Zhang presented these algorithmic improvements and explained their significance. Zhang said the software will greatly help with drug research in the future by allowing scientists to research viruses without using the 3-D atomistic model. \u201cThe research will help to solve many difficult problems,\u201d Zhang said. Bajaj said thus far his technology has mostly been applied to HIV research, but he has been approached by individuals wishing to use it for work on other viruses. \u201cHIV is just the first example,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cWe already have several other people interested in applying this technology to many, many other cases. Each one is where they don\u2019t have an atomistic model to begin with, and there is not any solution available other than ours.\u201d He said in terms of HIV research, his technology could be used to determine preventative cures for the virus. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration approved Gilead Sciences, Inc.\u2019s Truvada, a pill to be marketed as a preventative measure against HIV. Truvada is to be taken daily by those at high risk for HIV, but is not meant to treat those already infected. Controversy over the drug has emerged due to its cost of up to $14,000 a year and its less than 100 percent effectiveness, which could give users of the drug a false sense of security.

    "text_content": "UT Professor Aims to Increase Number of Women in IT, Computer Science | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT Professor Aims to Increase Number of Women in IT, Computer Science Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, October 22, 2012 THE HORN Lecia Barker, professor in UT\u2019s School of Information, recently received a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation to increase women\u2019s involvement in information technology. Lecia Barker remembers the day in 1977 when she got caught in a loop \u2014 accidently programming a computer to do the same command over and over again. The result nowadays would be code repeating on a monitor, but in the 70s the mistake meant a printer streaming out the command on paper for her and her entire business programming class to see. \u201cIt was embarrassing and shameful. I remember the shame and nobody to help me,\u201d said Barker. Today, Barker is helping to ensure that the support is there for women in information technology. She is a senior research scientist at the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), a nonprofit that works to increase the presence of women in technology and computing \u2014 a field which is about 75 percent male, according to NCWIT . \u201cPeople tell boys that if they\u2019re good at math they can be an engineer. For girls it just doesn\u2019t come up as much. We send kids off in gendered ways.\u201d \u2014 Lecia Barker, research professor at UT\u2019s School of Information Barker is also a research associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Information, and the National Science Foundation recently awarded her a $1 million grant to fund programs and research that promote and support women in information technology and computer science. The grant is part of a larger $9 million sum awarded to NCWIT. An important aspect of the grant is that it will help fund the creation of more resources for the NCWIT, said Barker. The materials \u2014 ranging from short talking points and top-10 lists to in-depth reports and ready-made lesson plans \u2014 are free, and they aid in disseminating information to outreach organizations, teachers and employers. Computer scientists are in high demand. At a spring 2010 job fair hosted by UT\u2019s College of Natural Sciences, 87 percent of the companies in attendance sought to recruit computer science majors. And according to NCWIT, the number of job openings in computer specialist fields is expected to grow by over a million by 2020 . But unfortunately, said Baker, many people simply don\u2019t know much about the field. \u201cOne of the biggest problems is we have a country where kids and the adults that influence them don\u2019t know what computer science is,\u201d said Baker. \u201cIn high school it\u2019s always an elective and it\u2019s usually not even considered against foreign language or orchestra.\u201d Women in particular are often underexposed to computer science because of gendered stereotypes and social expectation, said Baker, emphasizing subtle behavior that can nudge men and women toward different career paths. \u201cPeople tell boys that if they\u2019re good at math they can be an engineer,\u201d said Baker. \u201cFor girls it just doesn\u2019t come up as much. We send kids off in gendered ways.\u201d Bri Connelly, the president of the UT student organization Women in Computer Science (WiCS), also says that the stereotype of the computer scientist as a solitary coder is an image that she thinks keeps women away from the field. \u201cThere's a bad conception that computer science is not social, you work alone, and spend a lot of nights in the lab. This is so far from the truth,\u201d said Connelly. \u201cCS is a very collaborative area and the people are very creative and fun to work with. There is so much beyond sitting at a desk and writing code.\u201d Many of the resources provided by the NCWIT address the things Baker and Connelly point out, and clarify the role of computer science and what jobs in the field are actually like. Organizations like First Bytes and Girls Inc. are using NCWIT materials to help shape their own programs that expose girls to technology and computing, said Baker. Members of WiCS also work to inspire an early interest in computer science by participating in the University of Texas Computer Science Roadshow, \u201ca program where students visit K-12 schools to show them what computer science is like,\u201d said Connelly. The group also works to support each other with their Nell Dale Mentorship program, in which every freshman woman is assigned a mentor to guide her through her first years in the program. \u201cMost of the time you don't notice that you're one of very few women in your field. But sometimes you do,\u201d said Connelly. \u201cIt's important to have a community that's there for all the women in computing to remind them that they belong.\u201d NCWIT\u2019s support of women in computer science and technology extends into college and the workforce, said Baker. A major program is Pacesetters, a campaign which calls for senior university executives and corporations to commit to increase recruitment of women within their respective organizations. Companies supporting the Pacesetters initiative include IBM, Google and Microsoft. \u201cThe motto of the NCWIT is 50:50 by 2020,\u201d said Barker, referring to equality in men and women graduating in computer science, entering the computer science workforce and creating innovations. \u201cI think it's completely possible,\u201d said Connelly about the \u201c50:50 by 2020\u201d goal. \u201cHarvey Mudd [College in Claremont, Calif.] has already achieved this goal and I want UT to be next.\u201d News Categories Faculty Outreach Tags women in computing",

    "text_content": "The IT industry is begging for women workers | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The IT industry is begging for women workers Posted by Staci R Norman on Saturday, August 11, 2012 My SA | by Valentino Lucio When it comes to the technology industry, women are an endangered species. The number of women entering computer science and information technology fields is dramatically lower than their male counterparts, and the figure is shrinking. Take a ride up the corporate ladder, and the numbers get even smaller. It's a chicken-and-egg situation: There are fewer women in IT because few women have the education for those jobs. There are fewer women interested in getting that education because they see so few women in IT. Employers say they'd like to see more women in the industry. But if women aren't applying, how can employers hire them? The issue may have to do with cultural norms and the stereotype of who works in IT. \u201cIt's not necessarily overt discrimination, but it's what we call unconscious bias,\u201d said Jenny Slade, communications director for the National Center for Women & Information Technology. \u201cWe have gender stereotypes that we're often not even aware of. It might come down to something simple like the difference between buying your son an erector set and buying your daughter a doll. If you encourage young girls to tinker and take things apart and put them back together, it actually has an impact on building their confidence and determining how they feel about certain careers.\u201d To boost interest locally, companies and organizations are creating outreach programs to expose middle school-age kids to science, technology, engineering and math disciplines. It's the early exposure that industry leaders feel will erase gender stereotypes and help establish a more diverse IT workforce. Overcoming the stereotype of the tech geek may take time, but there are hopeful signs it could happen. \u201cA tech geek is no one who looks like me,\u201d said Andrea Mancillas-Caba\u00f1as, 30. But that didn't stop the speech teacher at Jay High School and professor at Northwest Vista College from learning the computing language needed to build her first mobile application, Brides & XV. It took her eight months to build her app, which aims to help brides and teen girls better plan their weddings and quincea\u00f1eras. \u201cI didn't go to school for this, but I wanted to try something new. We do need more women in the field to create technology for women, not men creating technology for women.\u201d IT careers and women In the professional ranks, women hold 25 percent of computer- and information technology-related jobs in the United States, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology. Climb the corporate ladder and the number of women at the top shrinks to about 20 percent. The figures get worse for minority women. Leading the charge is Asian women, who make up about 4 percent of the computing workforce. African American women come in at 3 percent, and Hispanic women bring up the rear at 1 percent. While there isn't a shortage of women working for technology companies in human resources, sales and marketing, seeing a woman in a technical role is rare. \u201cTechnology has taken on this stereotype of being a domain of pale males, so to speak. Something that white men are good at, and they're the best, and everyone else is inferior,\u201d Slade said. Finding enough qualified women to boost IT ranks is hard, said Juanita Sessions, assistant vice president of information technology at Dallas-based AT&T Inc. In an effort to boost female employment, AT&T sometimes hires women who show a propensity for technology, Sessions said, and then trains and molds then into IT pros. \u201cMany will have a design background, a communications background or engineering background that we can use to transform them into IT professionals.\u201d Nick Longo, director at San Antonio's Geekdom, a tech co-working space, said that for decades there has been an effort to pull more women into the industry, but the numbers haven't improved. He added that even though there's an abundance of technical jobs to be filled, not many women are among the applicants. \u201cPeople are always saying we need more women in tech,\u201d he said. \u201cI want more women in tech, too. It doesn't matter. Women aren't lining up around the block for jobs.\u201d The schooling issue The lack of women in IT stems back to a scarcity of women learning the skills for computer-related fields. In 1985, about 37 percent of those earning computer science degrees in the U.S. were women. In 2010, that number fell to 18 percent, according to data from the National Center for Women & Information Technology. Slade attributes the higher numbers in the past to the industry's newness. Since then, she says gender stereotypes have become more prominent, causing the numbers to dip. \u201cBack then, computing was new for everyone,\u201d Slade said. \u201cThe field wanted anyone who had a passion for it and had good ideas. It didn't matter what your gender was.\u201d When Sessions, 55, enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin in the mid-'70s, the industry was in its infancy and bulky computers were fed punch cards. There were just a handful of women in each computing class, and often women worked in female-only groups because the men would band together. But as the semesters passed, the tendency toward separation faded. \u201cAfter a while, we all became a team,\u201d she said. Locally and statewide, the numbers are better than the national average. From 2008-2011, the number of students who graduated with computer science-or information-technology-related degrees from Texas public universities held steady around 25 percent, according to figures from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board . At the University of the Incarnate Word , more than one-third of all students who enroll in technology programs are women, according to figures the school provided. But the university's numbers also reveal that more women are enrolling in technology programs that have an emphasis on graphic arts and business. Five years ago, women made up about 36 percent of all students who were enrolled in the computer graphic arts program there. Last year, the number was nearly 50 percent. UIW technology instructor Tim Porter said it's a 50-50 split in his upper-level classes, which focus on the business aspects of IT. Since he started teaching there in 2009, Porter has noticed that women visit his office hours more than guys and are typically more proactive in their efforts to understand the curriculum. \u201cIt really depends on the person, but there are female students who think they might break something and there are others who are more confident and take charge,\u201d he said. UIW faculty and staff actively reach out to female students in an effort to guide them into more technical pathways, Porter said. He said the school hosts IT sessions where women are exposed to the subject and shown that a technical employee isn't someone who is glued to a computer. \u201cWhen people think of IT, they still think of old IT, sitting behind a computer or being in a cubicle, and you're just working on a computer,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThat old mindset is slowly fading. But the way we educate the young females is showing them examples of women in IT leadership.\u201d Show me the tech Attracting and retaining women in IT is something several companies and organizations are working toward. San Antonio-based Rackspace Hosting Inc. has created a diversity program that includes mentor groups and networking events, said Tina McDaniel, a former inclusion and innovation adviser there. She left the company last month after more than five years. \u201cAt Rackspace, a lot of the women who I would talk to would be the only female on a team,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we looked at ways of building a mentor program or we also did networking events where we pulled all the women at Rackspace together so they could mingle and network with other women to start that pure mentor relationship.\u201d Angie Morehead is one employee involved in the mentorship programs there. It was the novelty of downloading and sharing music along with job security within a booming career field that steered Morehead, 31, to get her associate degree in network administration from San Antonio College . The two-year degree landed her an entry-level IT position at Rackspace. \u201cYou don't have to be a super geek to work in tech,\u201d she said. Over the past eight years, Morehead has developed her skills by attaining various technical certifications that have allowed her to move into a senior manager role at Rackspace. While women in technical roles are outnumbered there, she says it's the company's culture and the support from the mentor groups that encourages personal and professional growth among women there. \u201cI don't see myself as a woman in tech. I see myself as a Racker.\u201d Next month, Geekdom will launch its SparkEd program, which will reach out to about 1,500 students from middle schools in various districts around San Antonio, said Louis Pacilli , director of education at Geekdom. The program consists of 30 tech camps where students can learn about robotics, entrepreneurship, website design or computer programming. Although the camps are open to all students, Pacilli said there will be a push to involve more girls and expose them to role models such as women who hold IT leadership roles. \u201cLet's break out of the box that tech is just for boys,\u201d said Pacilli, who was an educator in New York City before coming to Geekdom this year. \u201cLet's expose (girls) to these technical areas early and see what happens.\u201d vlucio@express-news.net News Categories Outreach Tags careers",

The free weeklong camp showcases the potential of a career in technology to selected Texas high school girls. Campers attended presentations on subjects such as high level/low level programming, computer ethics, cryptography, logic games, and gender roles. At Corporate Chat, professional women working in the field of computer science talked with girls over lunch about what it\u2019s like to have a fascinating, well-paying job, and provided career mentoring. VMWare hosted a coding challenge, and outside the UTCS AI Lab, the girls explored Marvin, the autonomous driving vehicle. The campers also had ample opportunity for hands-on learning. They participated in a smartphone app programming challenge, using IPRO, a virtual robotics program designed to teach computational literacy. Campers went on a field trip to St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery to see how the robotic da Vinci Surgical System works and had a hands-on experience of maneuvering the robotic arms in an operating room. Rackspace guided the girls through a team building and communication game based on server communication theory, which involved logical thinking and problem solving. This year\u2019s lab project used Arduino hardware, an open-source electronics prototyping platform, to control a strand of programmable color changing LED lights. Campers first complete a C++ tutorial and programmed in a language similar to C++ to blink the lights and control their color and brightness. By the end of the week, they progressed to creating complicated moving light patterns. Campers enjoyed campus life and had a taste of what it\u2019s like to be a UTCS student. Department advisors talked to the girls about earning a degree in computer science, getting into UT, dual majors, scholarships, and career opportunities for UTCS graduates. They had a pool party, shopped on the drag, and played basketball, wallyball, and racquetball at UT RecSports. Sponsors, including Cisco Systems , Google , Lockheed Martin , Texas Film Commission , Texas Workforce Commission, and VMware pay all expenses for camp attendees. Google is also funding the annual First Bytes Workshop for Computer Science Teachers held in July. First Bytes Camp would not be possible the without the contribution of individuals and companies that participate in the numerous presentations, labs, and workshops throughout the weeklong camp: Professor Dana Ballard , Marjorie Morales, Dr. Alison Norman, Scott Sutcliffe, Alex Victoria, Professor Vijaya Ramachandran\u00ad\u00ad , Cisco Systems , Google , Lockheed Martin , St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery , Oracle , Rackspace , Union Pacific , Yahoo! .

It may be hard to accept but it\u2019s likely that we\u2019d all be much safer in autonomous vehicles driven by computers, not humans. Annually more than 30,000 Americans die in car crashes, almost all due to human error. Autonomous vehicles will communicate position and speed to each other and avoid potential collisions-without the possibility of dozing off or road rage. There are still many legal (and insurance) issues to resolve, but researchers who are revving up the development of autonomous vehicles are relying on geometry for recognizing and tracking objects, probability to assess risk, and logic to prove that systems will perform as required. The advent of autonomous vehicles will bring in new systems to manage traffic as well, for example, at automated intersections. Cars will communicate to intersection-managing computers and secure reservations to pass through. In a matter of milliseconds, the computers will use trigonometry and differential equations to simulate vehicles\u2019 paths through the intersection and grant entry as long as there is no conflict with other vehicles\u2019 paths. Waiting won\u2019t be completely eliminated but will be substantially reduced, as will the fuel--and patience--currently wasted. Although the intersection at the left might look wild, experiments indicate that because vehicles would follow precise paths, such intersections will be much safer and more efficient than the ones we drive through now.

    "text_content": "The Department of Computer Science Tweaks Curriculum to Be More Flexible | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Department of Computer Science Tweaks Curriculum to Be More Flexible Posted by Staci R Norman on Sunday, June 24, 2012 The Daily Texan | By Bobby Blanchard The Department of Computer Science will decrease the number of required classes needed to obtain a degree from the department, a move some faculty hope will allow students to specialize in their interests and experience more while attending school. Designed to be more flexible, the new curriculum has been a five-year endeavor by the department to allow students to take more electives. Bruce Porter, department chair of the computer science department, said the average student has time for 15 computer science classes. However, the old curriculum required students to take 11 specific courses to obtain a degree, leaving little time to take upper-division electives. The new curriculum has reduced the number of required courses to six. Porter said some students have jumped to conclusions of the department cutting back the number of required courses for budgetary reasons. \u201cI cannot think of any way that this has a budgetary side to it at all,\u201d Porter said. \u201cSure, the department has had budget cuts, we\u2019ve all had budget cuts. But that has nothing to do with the curriculum. This is based on what is best for teaching the field.\u201d He said the idea of scaling back on required classes to open up more upper-division elective options is taking place at computer science schools across the nation and UT was neither ahead nor behind the trend. Faculty in the department started talking about revisiting the computer science curriculum in 2007, Porter said. He also said the department took a lot of inspiration from a 2001 report by the Association for Computing Machinery, a national organization dedicated to delivering education resources for computing. The report, titled \u201cComputing Curricula,\u201d states that the required body of knowledge should be made as small as possible. \u201cOver the last decade, computer science has expanded to such an extent that it is no longer possible simply to add new topics without taking away,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe believe that the best strategic approach is to reduce the number of topics in the required core so that it consists only of those topics for which there is a broad consensus that the topic is essential to undergraduate degrees.\u201d Porter said the department wanted to change the curriculum because the field has gotten too big to try to teach in four years. Now, Porter said students can study the areas that most interest them in depth. \u201cFor some students, it\u2019s going to be the mathematical stuff, for others it\u2019s going to be game development,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEverybody has their own inclination.\u201d Although much of the new curriculum has already been implemented over the last couple of years, the most recent and final changes to the curriculum include reducing the number of theory classes. The department previously required four theory classes, but now students only have to take two. \u201cWhen you go to four to two, it is not like you can take the content in four courses and squeeze it down to two, because the students aren\u2019t any smarter than they had been before,\u201d Porter said. \u201cInstead you have to choose a little bit of one course and add a little bit of another.\u201d Before the most recent changes, the department reduced the number of required computer system courses from 12 hours of coursework to eight. \u201cA problem we had in the past is students would take these four system classes and never really come away with the big picture view of how a computer works,\u201d he said. Associate computer science professor William Cook said while he did not foresee the department needing to make any additional curriculum changes, adjustments might be needed. \u201cI do think there will probably be some adjustments to fine tune the current system,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere is a lot of room with flexibility, so if there are any problems we can tweak the curriculum.\u201d Cook said students in the new theory, systems and programming classes will experience classes taught at a faster pace. \u201cThere could be some struggle there as students adjust,\u201d Cook said. \u201cEssentially we are raising the bar and expecting more of the students.\u201d Calvin Lin, a computer science professor who chaired a committee that defined a new theory course under the new requirements, said students will find more excitement under the new requirements. \u201cThere is also an observation that our old curriculum, because there was this long chain of required courses, students often didn\u2019t see the pay off, they didn\u2019t see the excitement till a few courses down,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThe hope is by shrinking the core they will get to see some of the more exciting things quicker, and this is also an opportunity to bring some of the excitement into the core as well.\u201d Porter said he was pleased with the curriculum and he did not foresee any more upcoming changes. Nevertheless, he said teaching computer science is a constant struggle. \u201cThere will be a continual battle to keep each of these classes current,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBut the overall scaffolding of them, that is going to last us at least 10 years.\u201d News Categories Undergraduate Program Tags Bruce Porter Calvin Lin curriculum In the News William Cook",

Peter's main research interest in artificial intelligence is understanding how to best create complete intelligent agents. His research focuses mainly on machine learning, multiagent systems, and robotics. About the AAAI Fellows Program The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence's Fellows program was started in 1990 to recognize individuals who have made significant, sustained contributions---usually over at least a ten-year period---to the field of artificial intelligence. In February of each year, the AAAI membership nominates individuals whom they consider to have achieved unusual distinction in the field. These nominations are then considered by the Fellows Selection Committee, comprising 9 AAAI Fellows who are current members of AAAI and chaired by the immediate Past President of AAAI. The committee generally selects 5\u201310 new Fellows each year. Fellows' accomplishments range from pioneering advances in the theory of artificial intelligence, to unusual accomplishments in artificial intelligence technology and AI applications. Leadership in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence or similar scientific organizations that promote the advancement of artifical intelligence through educational programs and support of forums for the exchange of ideas also plays a role in the selection process.

    "text_content": "Fighting Back Against Click-Spam | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Fighting Back Against Click-Spam Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, August 21, 2012 Inside Microsoft Research | by Rob Knies Remember that time, a decade or so ago, when spam was the scourge of the Internet, when the sheer volume of junk email threatened to engulf legitimate correspondence and short-circuit the promise of the digital revolution? Those concerns are a bit distant these days. Spam is no longer Public Enemy No. 1 among the digerati. People have devised ways to combat it effectively. Our attentions have shifted to other, more recent problems\u2014such as click-spam. Click-spam is defined as fraudulent or invalid clicks on online ads where the user has no actual interest in the advertiser\u2019s site, but don\u2019t be misled into thinking this is merely some sort of Internet mischief. Click-spam has the potential to see millions of dollars of ad revenue misappropriated by nefarious means. The scope of the challenge is made clear in Measuring and Fingerprinting Click-Spam in Ad Networks , written by Vacha Dave , Yin Zhang , and Saikat Guha . The first two are from The University of Texas at Austin, and Dave is spending the summer as an intern at Microsoft Research India , working alongside Guha, a researcher at that lab. The paper is being presented in Helsinki on Aug. 15 during SIGCOMM 2012 , the annual conference of the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Special Interest Group on Data Communication. It is part of a strong presence from Microsoft Research: six papers, representing 18 percent of the 34 accepted; a poster; a keynote address for the Workshop on Mobile Gaming by Victor Bahl , director of the Mobile Computing Research Center at Microsoft Research Redmond ; and further Microsoft Research participation just about anywhere you look. The nature of research means that, sometimes, paths of inquiry can lead in unfamiliar directions. That, Guha confirms, is what led he and his co-authors to focus on click-spam. \u201cFor another project,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwhere we signed up as an advertiser, we noticed a large number of clicks, but very little return on investment. That led us to ask the question, \u2018How would one, in a rigorous, systematic way , go about estimating the quality of traffic on an ad network?\u2019 \u201cTo our surprise, we found this was extremely challenging, and, aside from a scattered few anecdotes, there was no well-known, systematic technique, so we decided to come up with one.\u201d That technique, described in the SIGCOMM 2012 paper, not only breaks new ground in examining the click-spam problem, but also provides the first independent methodology for advertisers to measure click-spam on their ads\u2014and delivers an automated method for ad networks to detect simultaneous click-spam attacks proactively. The latter is in response to one of the surprises the researchers encountered as they pursued the project: the poor quality of mobile-advertising-network traffic, as measured by how much time people spend on an advertiser\u2019s landing page. \u201cFor a reputed ad network, only one out of 20 people clicking our ad stayed for longer than five seconds,\u201d Guha reports. \u201cWe suspect this is because people mis-clicked the ad due to the small mobile-screen sizes and quickly hit the back button. \u201cGiven that mobile is the future of the Internet, this underscores the importance of our work of characterizing the problem today, so ad networks can make a concerted effort to fix it in years to come.\u201d The researchers also conducted a large-scale measurement study of click-spam across 10 major ad networks and four types of ads\u2014further setting the stage for new directions to pursue in attempting to stem the click-spam tide. \u201cEnabling researchers at universities and private institutions to do cutting-edge click-fraud research is, in my opinion, our most significant contribution,\u201d Guha says. \u201cUntil today, researchers assumed only companies the size of Microsoft that can run large ad networks, could make an impact on this space. \u201cThe techniques we designed allow anyone to discover and characterize problems in this space and present solutions. We believe this will spur intense research, much as in the early 2000s in the context of email spam, that will ultimately result in the broader community figuring out how to deal with click-fraud.\u201d News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Industry Relations Tags click-spam cybersecurity Microsoft Vacha Dave Yin Zhang",

Led by computer science professor Chandrajit Bajaj, university researchers employed algorithms and supercomputers from the Texas Advanced Computing Center to create 3D models of disease targets, exposing binding sites on viruses for drug molecules. And the high-performance computing has enabled the team to cut down the time required to discover drugs with the qualities needed to bind to the targets from months to days, Bajaj said in a statement. Both startups and Big Pharma have relied on computer-based methods to speed up drug discovery. Last year, for instance, Merck ( $MRK ) formed a partnership with Vancouver-based Zymeworks, which uses proprietary software to develop bi-specific antibodies. And GlaxoSmithKline's ( $GSK ) venture group SR One and Eli Lilly's ( $LLY ) Lilly Ventures were backers in Cambridge, MA-based Nimbus's $24 million Series A round last year, with some of the money expected to be invested in the company's software-supported discovery of drugs against difficult targets to combat cancer and inflammation. \"More and more, [drug companies] are moving into the computational drug screening arena, and more and more it's teams of people working together,\" Bajaj stated. \"The biophysicist, the biochemist and the synthetic chemist are sitting together with the computational expert, and they say it's giving them clues as to what they should be doing next.\" News Categories Faculty Research Tags Algorithmic Computational Biology Chandrajit Bajaj In the News",

As this year's class enters the strongest job market for graduates since 2008, students with backgrounds in computer science, engineering and accounting are in high demand, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). While the group's latest survey shows a 10.2 percent increase in hiring plans from 2011, the improvement isn't benefiting all majors the same way, as in pre-recession years, said Edwin Koc, who heads research at Bethlehem, Pa.-based NACE. This year\u2019s graduates in computer science, engineering and accounting are in high demand in the strongest job market for graduates since 2008, says the National  Association of Colleges and Employers. NACE shows a 10.2 percent increase in hiring over 2011. -Michael Okoniewsk/Bloomberg News The pattern mirrors a 2011 survey of students' job offers, said Koc: Graduates \"with certain skill sets are doing quite well,\" while things are tougher for others, such as liberal arts, humanities and education majors. NACE, a source of information about the employment of college graduates, estimates 1.7 million students will get their bachelor degree this year. At Virginia Tech's career services office, it is mainly students with technical degrees who are benefiting from a 25 percent increase in job postings this year and employers coming earlier to recruit, said Jim Henderson. These students are receiving more offers than two or three years ago and are sought after by companies, he said. \"For the nontechnical jobs, it's much more challenging,\" said Henderson, associate director for employer relations at the Blacksburg school. Graduates in those majors really have to \"network and have a job-search strategy on how they're going to find and connect with that employer.\" Thirty-seven percent of students who graduated between 2006 and 2011 wished they had been more careful when choosing their major, according to a report this month by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Only 39 percent said they thought about job opportunities when picking a field of study. Half of the 444 students in the survey were employed full time. A report on recruiting trends by the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University in East Lansing shows employers are seeking engineering, computer science, selected science, accounting and finance majors. About a third of them are committed to recruiting from all majors. Employers expect that students will have done at least one internship, maybe two, said Carl Martellino, the executive director at the University of Southern California's career center in Los Angeles, who says he has seen increased hiring directly out of such programs. \"Internships are really now the new interviews.\" Students also are showing more interest in small companies and startups than in the past, said Katharine Brooks, director of Liberal Arts Careers Services at the University of Texas at Austin. She has started teaching a class, \"The Liberal Arts Entrepreneur,\" in which students craft a business plan. \"With the economy slowly coming back, it might not be as easy as it used to be,\" said Anne Rose, an accounting student Anne Rose at Villanova University's School of Business in Pennsylvania. \"But if you're proactive about it and you've put time into your studies, I think that you can find employment opportunities.\" Excerpts from: The Portland Press Herald | Most wanted: Students with technical degrees News Categories Undergraduate Program Tags careers",

Dr. Richard Tapia at Rice University launched the ELA in 2007 at a national level, and The University of Texas at Austin is part of the leadership team. UTCS started an ELA student chapter in 2007, and our chapter is the largest in the nation. In 2009, the National Science Foundation gave the department funding for ELA students to get involved in undergraduate research. Samantha Salinas, a senior CS major and ELA research chair, shared her experiences in ELA over the last few years. One research project, which started in 2009, was an iPhone application called \u201cGive a Hand.\u201d The purpose of this mobile application was to help users keep up-to-date with natural disasters around the world. In general, the research group felt that natural disasters were something that \u201ccame and went\u201d in the news, with most of the world forgetting that providing relief to the victims was an ongoing process that needed continuous attention. The group presented a research paper and poster at the Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing conference in San Francisco last year. ELA members are currently working on a project called \u201cBookle,\u201d a website where professors can upload their own textbooks and students can highlight confusing parts and blog about their questions and concerns. ELA looks at this website as a way of combining social networking with collaborative learning. Samantha feels that her involvement in ELA has exposed her to a wide array of computer languages that she might not have otherwise been exposed to. She has also learned a great deal about problem solving, working in a group, collaborating, being assertive, and compromising when necessary. She feels that undergraduate research is important for all of these reasons, and it certainly helps students improve their applications to graduate schools, not to mention it looks good on a resume!

    "text_content": "A Tree of Life Grows in Texas | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content A Tree of Life Grows in Texas Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, April 11, 2012 Scientists continue to refine, and sometimes radically alter, our understanding of the \u201cTree of Life\u201d \u2014 the ways in which species are related to one another. They\u2019re using the computing power of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin to better understand the origin of species and, ultimately, help fight disease and develop better crops. Whereas once, evolutionary history was based on the relationships of bones, skeletons and other morphological clues, today DNA is now the main informer in the story of how the Earth became such a diverse place. Phylogenetics is the branch of life science that studies the evolutionary relationships among organisms based on genetic evidence. By aligning the molecular sequences of different species, scientists can see how organisms differ at the genetic level, determine where they diverged and map out branching trees of relationships based on the alignments. With the cost of gene sequencing declining, researchers are performing more phylogenetic studies. Even so, the process of lining up tens of thousands of sequences from hundreds or thousands of species is incredibly complicated, even for a computer. \u201cThe most accurate trees are estimated using methods that try to solve hard optimization problems,\u201d said Tandy Warnow , professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin and a Guggenheim Fellow. \u201cWhile those solutions can be done on small data sets or moderate sized data sets, on large data sets, they can take a very long time \u2014 weeks to months to years of computational time. The Texas Advanced Computing Center ends up being essential for those problems.\u201d TACC, on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin, runs some of the biggest and most powerful systems in the world, but even their supercomputers can hardly keep up with the pace of genetic research. According to Moore\u2019s law, the performance of computers doubles every two years. However, the ability of gene sequencers to create data has grown at an even faster rate. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of challenge,\u201d Warnow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just how we run analyses on big data sets, but how do we access the data in a way that is sensible?\u201d Divide and Conquer Warnow is working with postdoctoral fellow Kevin Liu of Rice University and Siavash Mirarab, a Ph.D. student in computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, to create smarter, faster and more accurate algorithms to apply to some of the biggest data sets ever created. With a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (through the Assembling the Tree of Life project), the researchers have developed software that allows computers to draw better evolutionary trees more quickly. It\u2019s called SAT\u00e9 \u2014 Simultaneous Alignment and Tree Estimation \u2014 and uses a novel divide-and-conquer approach. \u201cBy dividing a really big data set that\u2019s hard to align into small data sets that are closely related, you can get good estimates on each subset and then get an alignment on the full data set,\u201d Warnow explained. Massive supercomputers, such as Ranger at TACC, align the sequences of each subset and combine the alignments into an alignment on the full set of sequences. There\u2019s no way to know whether the tree that emerges from these simulations is absolutely accurate. Some trees are obviously wrong \u2014 for example, those that show humans and crocodiles on the same branch, separated from chimps \u2014 but most are probable. For that reason, SAT\u00e9 uses a statistical method to provide a maximum likelihood score: a measure by which to assess its accuracy against other answers. SAT\u00e9 repeats the process of alignment and tree-building many times until a tree with the highest likelihood score is reached. In software development, the best products are not just the newest, but the ones that are proved to be better than the alternatives. To this end, Warnow and her team have been working as quality assurance and reliability testers, solving hard evolutionary tree problems multiple times, with different methods and parameters, to ensure that SAT\u00e9 produces the highest-quality result. First reported in the journal Science and later explored in the journals PLoS Currents and Systematic Biology, the researchers have shown repeatedly that SAT\u00e9 works as well as the alignment and tree estimation methods that are commonly used, which analyze trees as single units. But SAT\u00e9 is far faster or achieves greater accuracy but in the same amount of time. For the Birds Warnow and her team also collaborate with evolutionary biologists on projects in which their guidance can lead to new insights. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s day, scientists have debated the evolutionary history of flightless birds, known at ratites. How did so many similar species get to such far-flung corners of the Earth? \u201cThe theory of continental drift provided a convenient answer,\u201d said Michael Braun, a curator in the department of systematic biology at the Smithsonian Institution. \u201cThese birds evolved from a common flightless ancestor and then drifted to their current distributions. For 40 years, this remained the textbook explanation of species dispersal.\u201d That is until Braun discovered through DNA analysis that an ancient (but still living) family of birds found in South America, the tinamou, was one of the most closely related groups to emus and ostriches. But the tinamou could fly \u2014 a finding first reported in 2009. This fact, combined with the lack of skeletal evidence of flightless birds before the continents broke apart, led to a re-conceptualization of the ratite branch of the avian tree. Ratites were in fact descended from flying birds that traveled to places where flight was no longer an evolutionary advantage and consequently lost their ability to fly. \u201cIt\u2018s hard to recognize the relationships among species using just morphology, but when we can use the molecules and appropriate analytical methods to find the relationships, it helps us understand better how that adaptive evolution has occurred,\u201d Braun said. Recently, Warnow worked with Braun, using SAT\u00e9, to reanalyze his controversial findings. Their study confirmed the evolutionary relationship that Braun found. Emergency Phylogenetics Better, faster, more accurate phylogenetic methods can have a life or death impact for humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses sequence alignment and evolutionary tree-building tools when a new virus emerges to determine where it might have come from and how it differs from previous viruses. Plant scientists also use tree-building tools to determine which genes are associated with positive traits such as hardiness and drought tolerance. This knowledge is enabling scientists to breed more productive crops, helping to feed the world. But none of these problems is easily solved. \u201cMany research groups are estimating trees containing anywhere from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of species, towards the eventual goal of estimating a Tree of Life, containing perhaps as many as several million leaves,\u201d Warnow wrote in a recent article in Systematic Biology. \u201cThese phylogenetic estimations present enormous computational challenges, and current computational methods are likely to fail to run even on datasets in the low end of this range.\u201d In other words, small problems may be within reach, but the big ones remain. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting any easier, but it is getting more fun,\u201d Warnow said.

As a stop on the crawl, Longhorn Startup Camp will showcase its residents \u2013 27 new startups, all originated at the university. The crawl is open to the public, and interested attendees may RSVP online . The 27 companies, along with Bob Metcalfe, professor of innovation at the Cockrell School of Engineering , and Kyle Cox, director of the Austin Technology Incubator's University Incubator, will discuss business visions and the startup environment overall. Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and founder of 3Com Corp., will give an overview at 6 p.m. of the startup camp and the new vision for startups at the university. \"The paramount goal of Longhorn Startup Camp is to establish a space in which students with startups can congregate, creating a critical mass of startup activity, a breeding ground for ideas, learning, exchanges of best practices, team formation and general celebration of startup progress,\" Metcalfe said. The 30,000-square-foot space, located at 1616 Guadalupe St., is a new initiative of The University of Texas at Austin. Executive Vice President and Provost Steven Leslie has agreed to loan the camp the space until the end of the spring semester. Its goal is to encourage student entrepreneurship and collaboration among startups at the university. The vision for Longhorn Startup Camp came from Metcalfe and Cox, along with John Butler, director of the university's IC 2 Institute, and Austin entrepreneur Joshua Baer, who is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and managing director of Capital Factory. The camp is currently at 85 percent occupancy, and primary residents have been companies from 1 Semester Startup (1SS) and ATI, which is directed by Isaac Barchas. Within the first days of alerting the 1SS and ATI, 27 companies and four student organizations had committed to space. Other student companies have also taken up space at the camp, including companies from ATI, 3 Day Startup, the graduate level Idea-to-Product courses, McComb's Master in Science and Technology and Texas Venture Labs programs, the Dell Social Innovation Challenge and more. \"I believe Longhorn Startup Camp represents the future of student entrepreneurship at UT Austin,\" Barchas said. \"There needs to be a place where student innovators can congregate and benefit from Austin\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem and from each other.\" Student organizations, including the Technology Entrepreneurship Society, the Student Entrepreneurship Organization and the College of Natural Science's newly formed Entrepreneurship Society, have also used the space.

    "text_content": "UT professor leads research into autonomous intersection technology | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content UT professor leads research into autonomous intersection technology Posted by Staci R Norman on Sunday, March 4, 2012 Austin American-Statesman | By Cristina Pe\u00f1a Having already designed an SUV that drives itself, a project group at the University of Texas is now working on the technological next step: an autonomous intersection that lets driverless vehicles navigate without stoplights or stop signs. The group \u2014 a partnership between UT and Austin Robot Technology, a team of volunteer engineers dedicated to building the autonomous SUV \u2014 might be the only one in the nation researching the possibilities for autonomous intersections, said Peter Stone, the project leader and a UT associate professor of computer science. The SUV is formatted with a software program, which is layered to have three main functions. The pilot function controls the brake, throttle and steering, while the navigator function chooses paths on the road. Using the SUV's GPS, the navigator targets speed limits to adjust the throttle. These two functions then communicate with a revolving sensor on the top of the SUV that detects the road and objects around the vehicle. The sensor has a high density light radar with 64 lasers arranged to scan the area. Autonomous vehicles have been a reality for several years, but the research by Stone's team aims to create a system that would interface with those vehicles, coordinating the direction and flow of traffic through an intersection. Then, in theory, multiple driverless vehicles could navigate the streets without crashes. The research \u2014 which is ongoing at UT's main campus and at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus \u2014 is using an autonomous SUV built by Austin Robot Technology. To make the autonomous intersection work, a software program will be installed in the intersection to communicate with the vehicle's software. The two systems use dedicated short-range communication to communicate wirelessly 300 to 400 meters away, which would let the driverless vehicles know when the intersection is clear to pass through. Stone said the technology could conceivably hit the streets in the next few decades. \"The autonomous intersection, technologically, I believe is already feasible to be widespread,\" said Stone, who is also director of the Learning Agents Research Group, which operates with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in UT's Department of Computer Science. \"I wouldn't be against it happening in the next 20 to 25 years.\" Because of the expense involved \u2014 the sensor array for the car costs about $75,000 \u2014 the technology's first practical applications might be for the U.S. military, said Arturo Martin-de-Nicholas, president of Austin Robot Technology. \"The technology is very expensive, so you're not going to be seeing this in passenger vehicles yet,\" Martin-de-Nicholas said. \"The military does have the money, and eventually that technology will trickle down to the consumer.\" The military is aiming to have a significant portion of military vehicles be autonomous by 2015, Martin-de-Nicholas said. He said aerial drones are leading the trend, but ground navigation will be more difficult. \"You're starting to see it already with drones in Afghanistan to track things on the ground,\" Martin-de-Nicholas said. \"It's actually harder on the ground because you have people walking and obstacles of varying terrain.\" In fact, it was a competition for the U.S. military that launched Martin-de-Nicholas and Austin Robot Technology into researching autonomous vehicles. The federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began hosting the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004 as a engineering competition for autonomous vehicles. Austin Robot Technology created an autonomous SUV to compete in the challenge in 2005, but it did not make it into the finals. Austin Robot Technology reached out to UT because of challenges with writing software, Martin-de-Nicholas said. When Austin Robot Technology decided to take part in the DARPA Urban Challenge, a new competition to find autonomous vehicles that could drive in a city setting without collisions, Stone joined the team and helped prepare the vehicle. The team made it to the semifinals. The team sought out Stone because it didn't feel they had the robotics expertise to compete in the urban challenge, said Jack O'Quin, a former IBM developer who work on software for the project and with the undergraduate research team at UT. \"We provided the platform, computers and engineering details to actually make the car,\" O'Quin said. The University of Texas \"provided the artificial intelligence, which is really the hard part of the project.\" The project \u2014 which typically involves about six staffers \u2014 is being funded through a Federal Highway Administration grant and by UT's Freshman Research Initiative, which is a program aimed at getting freshmen involved in research programs early in their college career. The autonomous car and intersection project is an attractive research option for many at UT. Tsz-Chiu Au, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of computer science at UT, said he hopes the technology will be widely available at some point. \"I don't expect it will happen very soon but I will keep doing research and making it better and better,\" Au said. \"The most motivation for me is to do something that will have some impact on society, even if the impact won't be immediate.\" Contact Cristina Pe\u00f1a \u2028at 445-3797 News Categories Research Faculty Tags Peter Stone Marvin autonomous intersection management Artificial Intelligence",

Kneeling (left to right): Julian Michael, Craig Yeh. Not pictured: Carlos Rosales. AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A team of computer science undergraduates, mentored by staffers of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), won the seventh annual Student Cluster Competition (SCC) this year at the Supercomputing \u201912 (SC12) conference in Salt Lake City. SC12 has been the seminal international conference for high-performance computing (HPC) for the past 24 years. The SCC challenges rival teams of university undergraduates in a 72-hour battle to prove that they can design, build, optimize and run the fastest and most efficient cluster computing system. In this real-time, nonstop competition, teams of six students assemble their clusters on the exhibit floor and race to demonstrate the greatest sustained performance across a series of applications and scientific workloads. The University of Texas team took first place in the overall standings, breaking the two-year winning streak of Team Taiwan (National Tsing Hua University). \u201cNone of us expected to win, but we didn\u2019t expect to lose either \u2026 We were thrilled,\u201d said Craig Yeh, a third-year computer science major in the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cThe win validated all of the work we did since May leading up to the competition. I highly recommend this experience to other students at The University of Texas.\u201d The winning student team members are Andrew Wiley, Reid Douglas McKenzie, Michael Teng, Anant Rathi, Craig Yeh and Julian Michael. Learn more about the team members . The competition draws teams from around the world, including the United States, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Germany, Russia and Taiwan. The teams work with company sponsors several months in advance to design and build a cutting-edge system from commercially available components. This year, the University of Texas team and TACC partnered with Dell, Nvidia and Intel to design and build a hybrid, power-saving system that integrated graphic processing units (GPUs), Intel processors and a new-generation Dell chassis. The company sponsors provide the hardware and travel funds, while the TACC mentors work side by side with the students to teach them the fundamentals of cluster construction, systems administration and program optimization. Chevron and Mellanox Technologies also served as sponsors of this year\u2019s team. One additional challenge of the competition is that the systems cannot exceed a 26 amp power limit, which is the electrical equivalent of three standard-size coffee makers. \u201cIt\u2019s a real-world situation,\u201d said John Lockman, the team\u2019s lead mentor and a member of TACC\u2019s High Performance Computing group. \u201cFor example, a data center in industry might need to expand but can\u2019t due to financial or space constraints, so they have a limited amount of power and a scientific workload that they have to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d John Cazes and Carlos Rosales-Fernandez, also from TACC, helped mentor the students. TACC and its industry partners have sponsored student teams in the competition since 2010, when the University of Texas team received the highest Linpack score and was the first team in the competition\u2019s history to submit a Linpack score higher than a teraflop. In 2011 the university\u2019s team built an energy-saving cluster that was submerged in mineral oil. It had the highest Linpack score among CPU-only teams. \u201cWe had the opportunity to manage an entire project at a high level to get real science results. For me, the exposure to the scientific applications was the best part,\u201d Yeh said.

Photo by Wyatt McSpadden. Intersections of the future will not need stop lights or stop signs, but will look like a somewhat chaotic flow of driverless, autonomous cars slipping past one another as they are managed by a virtual traffic controller, says computer scientist Peter Stone . \u201cA future where sitting in the backseat of the car reading our newspaper while it drives us effortlessly through city streets and intersections is not that far away,\u201d says Stone, a professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin. Stone\u2019s research focuses on creating artificially intelligent (AI) computing systems, and he is developing some of the systems that are needed to make autonomous driving a reality. For example, Stone and his students created an autonomous car, named Marvin, in cooperation with Austin Robot Technology that competed in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge competition . Stone presented his research Saturday on autonomous intersection management at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. \u201cComputers can already fly a passenger jet much like a trained human pilot, but people still face the dangerous task of driving automobiles,\u201d he says. \u201cVehicles are being developed that will be able to handle most of the driving tasks themselves. But once autonomous vehicles become popular, we need to coordinate those vehicles on the streets.\u201d To that end, Stone is developing virtual intersection systems that will make auto travel safer and faster. In his newest system, AI driver agents (the autonomous vehicles) \u201ccall ahead\u201d and reserve space and a time at an intersection. Then an arbiter agent, called an \u201cintersection manager,\u201d approves the request, and the vehicles move through. There is little stopped traffic. [ Watch simulation video .] For now, the action takes place mainly as a simulation on a computer, or with a single real car (for example, Marvin) interacting with many other simulated cars. But Stone says the day is near when we\u2019ll start seeing autonomous vehicles on the streets, and the benefits of controlling the cars \u2013 and traffic \u2013 will be realized.

    "text_content": "Driving on Autopilot | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Driving on Autopilot Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, February 28, 2012 The Alcalde | Rose Cahalan Imagine driving down a street at rush hour. It\u2019s a typical commute, but this time, you\u2019re reading a newspaper in the backseat. The driver\u2019s seat is empty\u2014your car is driving itself. Sounds like a fantasy, right? After all, even The Jetsons \u2019 flying car had a driver. \u2022 Wrong. Self-driving cars are the future, says UT computer science professor Peter Stone. \u201cWe have the technology\u2014legal and culture changes are what will take time,\u201d Stone says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see autonomous cars on the road within 25 years.\u201d \u2022 In Austin, a robot car is already on the road \u2014 the closed-off roads at UT\u2019s Pickle Research Center, that is. His name is Marvin, he\u2019s a 1999 Isuzu with a cool quarter million in hardware, and he\u2019s getting students hooked on computer science. One recent afternoon, about 10 people gathered at the research center to take Marvin for a spin. Piyush Khandelwal, a computer science doctoral student, teaches a two-semester Freshman Research Initiative course that lets undergrads program the car. A full year\u2019s work has boiled down to this day. It\u2019s time to demonstrate their final projects. Khandelwal and his students are joined by Don McCauley and Jack O\u2019Quin, engineers with Austin Robot Technology. Their company owns the car, which UT leases for the course. Sophomore Corbin Montague\u2019s project is to get Marvin to detect an obstacle and maneuver around it. A plastic cone in the left lane symbolizes a parked car. O\u2019Quin\u2014whose long white beard, Tito\u2019s Vodka cap, and faded jeans are more cowboy than computer nerd\u2014climbs in the driver\u2019s seat, with Montague at his side. They use a converted PlayStation joystick to set the car in autonomous mode. Everyone stands back as the two make final adjustments. A huge laser scanner, called a velodyne, spins rapidly, giving the car\u2019s six computers feedback on the locations of objects. At about 15 miles per hour, the car drives toward the cone. There\u2019s something eerie about watching the steering wheel turn on its own as engineer and student sit unmoving. Then, just a few feet from the obstacle, the car veers into the ditch\u2014the fault of a GPS error. \u201cI tested this a lot in simulation,\u201d Montague explains, \u201cbut more can go wrong in the real world.\u201d The real-world factor, Stone says, is what makes the robot car a great teaching tool. \u201cIt\u2019s tangible and it\u2019s fun,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it gives students a taste for how research really works.\u201d But in 2007, when Stone first proposed that UT undergrads work on the car, not everyone agreed. \u201cResearchers at other schools thought I was crazy for letting undergrads work on the car,\u201d Stone remembers. \u201cThey said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t let 19-year-olds near this thing with a 10-foot pole.\u2019 But it has worked out wonderfully.\u201d Montague says that working with the car solidified his interest in graduate school. \u201cNo other class allowed me to do research as a freshman,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I know how research works, and I\u2019m going to continue. I definitely want to get my master\u2019s, maybe a PhD eventually.\u201d The numbers back him up: The 500 UT students who join a Freshman Research Initiative course each year are 23 percent more likely than their peers to attend graduate school. And what other project gives students a front seat to technology that could revolutionize our roads? \u201cMore than 90 percent of auto accidents are caused by human error,\u201d Stone says. \u201cAutonomous cars may save lives.\u201d News Categories Faculty Research Tags Artificial Intelligence Marvin autonomous intersection management",

Photo by Elizabeth Dillon. Daily Texan staff. By Jody Serrano , Daily Texan , 11/2/2011 Two weeks ago while staying up late cramming for a test, finance senior Ian Beckcom wished he could talk to somebody about the questions he had before he took the exam the next day. Beckcom said he wondered what it would be like to chat with professors and fellow students while he studied and why there was not already a technology to meet this need. His answer reminded him of why he and three other classmates decided to form Homeroom, a software company that runs an online learning management information system similar to Blackboard. Beckcom and his team were one of the 20 teams that presented a 5-minute company investor \u201cpitch\u201d to a crowd of more than 200 students, professors and local entrepreneurs at the 1 Semester Startup \u201cDemo Day\u201d showcase Thursday night. 1 Semester Startup is an interdisciplinary course that began this semester and allows undergraduates with startup companies to gain first-hand experience in running and developing successful businesses. Engineering professor Bob Metcalfe , finance professor John Butler and computer science specialist Joshua Baer lead the class. Baer said the class consists of 75 enrolled students from across all majors and 25 mentors from the Austin entrepreneur community. \u201cThe biggest value comes from bringing experienced mentors to spend time with the students,\u201d Baer said. \u201cSome of this you can\u2019t get from textbooks.\u201d In order to be a mentor, entrepreneurs need to have started one or more startup companies. Students meet with mentors once a week to convey updates, challenges and progress. Baer said along with the mentorship program, the professors wanted students to take care of their health and focus on their planning, writing, speaking and selling skills. He said engineering and computer science students are not usually taught the latter three skills. Russell Hinds, a managing partner at RSH Ventures, mentors Beckom and the group behind the Homeroom startup. Hinds said he loves working with the group because there\u2019s a lot of passion but not a lot of business sense of what might be important to an investor. \u201cWith students, a little bit of advice goes a long way,\u201d Hinds said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can accomplish in this special environment. It\u2019s a spiritual getaway for an entrepreneur, doing more than what they expected in a short period of time.\u201d Computer science senior Andrew Miller, also a part of Homeroom, said the team is working to develop a beta version of Homeroom and has professors and students that have agreed to try the program out once it is finished. \u201cThe fact is that this class is a set up, it\u2019s low risk, \u201d Miller said. \u201cIf we fail we\u2019re not $50,000 in debt.\u201d Miller said if the company does not work out, there would always be next semester for more opportunities. Rudy Garza, an investor at G-57 Capital, said he saw three student pitches he would follow up on and potentially invest in. \u201cAs far as students startups go, it\u2019s interdisciplinary and that\u2019s monumental,\u201d Garza said.

Computer programmers who can build video games or mobile phone apps are especially in demand. At a recent North Austin happy hour, friends greet each other, swapping gossip, and job recruiters roam the room, building connections. This is what Matt Genovese envisioned when he created Door 64 . The group is a way for tech workers to polish their people skills. \u201cTechnology folks aren\u2019t always known for just coming out on a whim and meeting each other at this kind of event, but I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019re able to do it here in Austin,\u201d Genovese said. Holly Berry hires software developers for Electronic Arts , a game company with titles like Madden NFL and Medal of Honor . The jobs are in Austin, but the talent search is national and highly competitive. \u201cThe top 10 percent, the top talent in the industry, every company is vying for at the same time, so it makes it an extremely competitive market,\u201d Berry said. Long Cao, 23, is a Web developer, writing computer code for a startup called SpareFoot . The 2011 University of Texas graduate chose the company for the good salary and hip culture. SpareFoot\u2019s Brazos Street office has big windows, a foosball table and dartboard, and colorful, urban-style murals \u2014 part workplace, part college hangout. \u201cThe first phase of our interview was, we went to Buffalo Billiards, and we went to happy hour with the development team,\u201d Cao said. \u201cWithin the first 10 minutes I knew that this was a team that I could work with.\u201d The nationwide talent pool is limited. So keeping software developers happy is job No. 1 for Austin tech companies. Just ask Rich Warwick. He recently opened an Austin outpost for the California company Evernote . It\u2019s a hot application, with tens of millions of users and a lot of buzz. Warwick wants to grow the office from 10 people to 200 over the next three years. For that to happen, Evernote needs to keep increasing its revenue, but Warwick also has to find the talent. \u201cThere\u2019s a good solid workforce here in Austin,\u201d Warwick said. \u201cLots of companies saw it, and they\u2019ve descended on Austin, sucked up all the talent. Now we\u2019re pretty much stealing from each other and having to recruit outside of Austin.\u201d More students are choosing programming at UT, Austin Community College, St. Edwards University, and other Texas colleges. But there still aren\u2019t enough graduates to fill demand. At UT, for example, computer science enrollment stands at 1,351, only half of what it was at its 2001 peak. Seniors in UT\u2019s computer science program this year have already received an average of two job offers. A typical 2012 salary is more than $70,000, with many offers over $100,000 a year. Computer Science Department Chairman Bruce Porter says he\u2019s seen this before. \u201cIt\u2019s not as hot quite yet as it was in the mid-\u201990s, but we\u2019re getting close to that point,\u201d Porter said. He says his department can handle many more students, if they\u2019ll sign up. \u201cOur department is an open-enrollment department. That mans anybody who wants to be a CS major declares it and just simply joins,\u201d he said. One recruiter said quietly that anyone who can write code can get a job right now. UT sophomore Emily Ledbetter is not a computer science major, but she can write code and has landed a paying internship this summer. She\u2019s sold on software as a career. \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m worried about is what industry I want to go to,\u201d Ledbetter said. \u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t know, there are too many out there.\u201d Regan Templeton of ReportingTexas.com contributed to this story.

    "text_content": "From the Chair - Partnership | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content From the Chair - Partnership Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, January 25, 2012 Every good partnership strengthens all the partners, and our new relationship with SunGard Availability Services is a perfect example. SunGard is a Fortune 500 company, founded in 1983 to provide software and IT services for the financial industry, higher education and the public sector. With this focus, it\u2019s no surprise that SunGard is deeply invested in cloud computing, in which services are provided via the Internet from huge data centers that operate very efficiently due to economies of scale. However, cloud computing raises technical challenges, such as securing the services from cyber attack and guaranteeing the privacy of customers\u2019 data. It also raises new opportunities, such as parallel processing across millions of cores. To explore these challenges and opportunities, SunGard searched nationally for a university to partner with, and they wisely chose UTCS. Their decision was largely based on the strength of the department\u2019s research in operating systems, computer networks, distributed computing and parallel processing. In part, our #8 national ranking in CS comes from building a powerhouse research group in these areas over two decades of concerted effort. But, what attracts UTCS to partner with SunGard? First, companies offer the resources to build really large systems, and to deploy them in ways that collect meaningful data, which can be much more illuminating that building prototypes and running simulations. Second, SunGard understands the value of university research and appreciates the long-term nature of fundamental research. The company\u2019s CTO, Dr. Indu Kodukula, is a Ph.D. graduate of Cornell\u2019s computer science program, so he knows our culture well. Our relationship with SunGard will be a true partnership. SunGard scientists and engineers will be embedded in our research teams, thanks to the opportunities created by the Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex , which opens December 2012. Still, this partnership could not have been established without the new willingness of the Office of Technology Commercialization \u2013 under the leadership of Dr. Richard Miller \u2013 to flexibly negotiate IP terms, royalties, and so on. We plan to start small with two projects in the first year, then to gradually add additional projects. The first projects will focus on storage and hypervisors, critical components of a cloud-computing facility. Cloud storage allows high-performance access to vast amounts of data, and hypervisors allow multiple guest operating systems to run concurrently on a server, ensuring that these guests can share virtualized hardware resources while being isolated from each other. The goal of the Depot project, led by Professors Michael Walfish , Lorenzo Alvisi , and Michael Dahlin , is to build a cloud storage service that operates under minimal assumptions of trust. It is being designed to tolerate buggy behavior by servers, while providing safety and liveness guarantees to clients. The goal of Professor Keshav Pingali \u2019s project is to find bottlenecks in the design and implementation of the current generation of hypervisors, and to eliminate the bottlenecks to permit them to scale to a large number of cores.

    "text_content": "Avoiding Red Lights by Booking Ahead | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Avoiding Red Lights by Booking Ahead Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, February 21, 2012 Discovery News | By Jesse Emspak A computer program that reserves slots at an intersection might be a way to ease gridlock and boost safety. THE GIST Future cars could be equipped with computer systems that \"call ahead\" to intersections. The intersections can then reserve a green light for the approaching vehicle. The concept could avoid gridlock and reduce collisions, claims a computer scientist. Computers can reserve your plane ticket, your hotel room and your restaurant table. Why not your place at an intersection? The concept is simple: a computer in a car calls ahead to the nearest intersection it is headed toward, and says it will arrive at a given time. The intersection checks to see if anyone else is arriving then, and if the slot is open, it tells the car to proceed. If it isn't, it tells the car that and the car is responsible for slowing down or stopping. That's the idea Peter Stone, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, is presenting at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Rather than trying to keep track of all the cars on the road, all the intersection's computer does is say whether there is a space for the next vehicle, given a list of time slots. \"It's a bit like reserving at a hotel room,\" Stone said. \"When you call a hotel and say you are arriving Friday, they check to see if there is a room. They don't call up everyone else at the hotel and ask them to change their travel plans.\" If there is no room, the traveler changes the arrival date or finds another hotel. The intersection would work in a similar fashion. Cars are becoming more sophisticated, and there is already a lot of work being done networking cars (including at least one concept model from Ford ). Integrating them with the traffic signals isn't a large step, and that could boost the efficiency of traffic, as well as safety. The Department of Transportation reported that in 2009 there were 5.5 million car crashes and 2.2 million were at either an intersection or \"intersection related.\" Of those accidents, 699,000 resulted in injuries, and 6,770 resulted in deaths. Part of the reason intersections are dangerous \u2014 in some cases more so than highways \u2014 is because the vehicles are going in different directions, so sideswipes are more common. When cars collide, a thin door is much less protection than an engine block. But the other major factor is human behavior. Green lights are designed to operate in waves that allow cars traveling at a set speed to travel freely for some distance, but few ever keep to that speed \u2014 one person is going faster and another slower, and it isn't long before the smooth flow of traffic is a mess. Stone wanted to solve some of that and keep the computing complexity to a minimum. One could, Stone said, link the intersections as well, so that along certain routes they could coordinate traffic flow. (If such an intersection's computer were to fail it would be no different than when traffic lights go out). Others in the field are working on similar problems. Denis Gillet, associate professor of information systems at Switzerland's Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, noted that vehicles could do a certain amount of \"planning ahead\" for their trajectories, by exchanging information with each other. Gillet said the idea in any of these systems is to get vehicles to slow down, but not stop, because slowing and stopping is not very energy-efficient. Philip Tanoff, who recently retired as director of the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology at the University of Maryland, is skeptical that such a system could work with only a few cars equipped to signal the traffic intersection. \"It seems that it would work only under optimal conditions,\" he said. Though the onus of adjusting speeds and arrival times (or stopping) is on the cars, the question, he says, is whether they could account for many other factors on the road \u2014 pedestrian traffic, for instance, crossing at a crosswalk. Stone said his technology can work with even just a few vehicles linked to the intersections, since the car can still take into account what the (unconnected) ones around it are doing. \"The benefits are less when there are human drivers,\" he said. \"But it is still safer.\" Stone is also researching methods of dynamically changing the number of lanes in each direction on major roads to respond to traffic flows. Altering the lanes is familiar to anyone who has driven into New Your City's Lincoln Tunnel, or seen the huge machines moving barriers on New York's Tappan Zee Bridge. In this case, a combination of lane changes and managing traffic flows at the intersections could mean better traffic flows through a city.

Unfortunately, it's also known for heavy traffic. \"People spend on average 48 hours per year stuck in traffic, which costs about $4 billion in fuel costs and lost productivity,\" said University of Texas Computer Science Professor Peter Stone. At UT, there's new talk about a revolutionary high-tech invention that could change the way you drive: an autonomous, high-tech wired car that doesn't need a driver. It can manage and drive a car by itself by using a computer system that manages traffic flow, instead of traffic lights at intersections or roads. They think one day drivers will be able to sit in the back seat and read a newspaper while they ride to work. \"The idea is that there's a computer program at the intersection that accepts reservations from the cars and the car says, 'I want to arrive at a particular time. I'd like to go straight or turn left or turn right. Yes, go ahead that time is yours' and won't let any other car collide with you,\" said Stone. So why would anyone want to take a seat in the back of their own car and to leave the driving to their smart vehicle? \"Some people may use it as extra leisure time,\" said Stone. \"You could be reading the newspaper or watching TV. Some people may use it for extra work time and productivity.\" And more than just relaxing while going to and from, Stone said it would also be safer to get around. \"Intersections are also where many accidents take place, the source of one-quarter of all accidents and one-third of all fatal accidents -- even though it's a tiny fraction of a roadway,\" said Stone. \"So really, we're trying to improve the efficiency and safety on intersections, and this could have a huge impact on quality of life within cities.\" Stone said they're trying to get carmakers and government entities in on this artificial intelligence, but he knows it could be a long and expensive road getting there.

Earlier this month, thanks to the generous support of AMD , ConocoPhillips and Yahoo! , 20 of The University of Texas at Austin Computer Science (UTCS) students attended The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference in Portland, Oregon. The conference \u2014 named after legendary computer scientist Rear Admiral Grace Hopper \u2014 is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront.  \"The Grace Hopper Conference is one of the best ways to connect with women around the nation\u2014I loved how many interesting people I was able to talk with, and how much I was able to learn about what is happening in so many fields at so many companies.

    "text_content": "Austin battles shortage in high-end software engineering talent | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Austin battles shortage in high-end software engineering talent Posted by Staci R Norman on Saturday, December 10, 2011 AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN | By Lori Hawkins, Kirk Ladendorf Austin's supply crunch for software developers was bad enough by September to prompt 25 Central Texas tech executives to fly to California in search of new talent. They offered free beer and pulled pork tacos at the Mighty, a warehouse bar in San Francisco, to attract a couple of dozen job candidates. The next night, they headed to Sunnyvale , in the heart of Silicon Valley, for a Tex-Mex happy hour that drew another 45 potential recruits. After resumes were shared, business cards exchanged and several follow-up phone interviews completed, not a single one of those California candidates has made the move to Texas, according to the Austin Technology Council, which organized the trip. \"It's even tighter there than it is here,\" said participant Rod Favaron , CEO of Austin startup Spredfast . \"The challenge is there just aren't enough good software developers to go around.\" In an otherwise sluggish U.S. economy, an intense national talent war is being waged for engineers with critical skills in hot areas. Austin is one of a number of fronts \u2014 which include California, the Northeast and other tech centers such as Seattle and Boulder, Colo. \u2014 where recruiters and executives say the supply of talent can't keep up with demand. In Austin, software engineers with the latest skills are in high demand, and some startups, confronted with attracting talent or seeing their business progress slow down, are poaching people from other companies in town. Silicon Valley companies are just as eager to raid Austin for the right skills. Last week, social media giant Facebook snapped up top technical talent at Austin-based Gowalla, which ran a location-based social networking service. Gowalla will shut down its operations here and move some key staffers, including co-founder Josh Williams, to Facebook's Palo Alto headquarters. Recruiters say the fiercest demand is for top-level, experienced workers with a few critical skills. Those skills include user interface, which involves designing the look and feel of a software application; mobile apps development, which entails programming for smartphones and tablets; and cloud computing software, which requires new kinds of code. Keeping skills in line with demand so startups can grow will determine what Austin's technology ecosystem looks like over the next decade. \"These are the companies that are bringing in the outside dollars that fuel our local economy,\" said Mike Rollins , president of the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce , which is pursuing solutions to the labor crunch. \"If these companies are unable to grow their businesses in Austin, they will be forced to relocate elsewhere. Every economy needs to keep reinventing itself, and software is an area where we in Austin have the ability to prosper.\" The software industry accounts for about 20 percent of Austin's tech industry and is its fastest-growing sector, according to Austin economist Angelos Angelou . Central Texas has about 1,860 software companies employing roughly 20,000 people, he said. Those numbers don't tell the whole story. Austin's software community \u2014 both homegrown startups and high-profile newcomers such as Facebook \u2014 add to Austin's cool factor and bring cultural benefits, prestige and growth potential. But in terms of size, Austin's software industry is dwarfed by Silicon Valley. The Northeast, anchored by Boston, is the second-largest U.S. software center, followed by a group of emerging regions, including Austin. The current shortage can be traced to the Internet bust a decade ago, when tech companies stopped recruiting and computer science enrollment dropped at the University of Texas and other schools across the country. That decline in the technical talent base, coupled with the rise of new companies in need of software developers in a few select niches, paved the way for today's tech talent crunch. For Austin, which has used its skilled technical workforce as a strategic weapon to lure operations from fast-growing, high-paying companies such as Facebook and PayPal, the pressure is on to find ways to grow its talent base. That's especially important as the region's high-tech economy shifts from being dominated by big semiconductor and hardware manufacturing companies with large workforces to a new generation of small, entrepreneurial upstarts. Homegrown Austin companies such as online vacation rental company HomeAway and software developer BazaarVoice have grown enough to establish college recruiting efforts. But many startups can't afford to bring in talented programmers from outside. \"We've fallen into a trap of fighting over existing talent,\" Favaron said, \"and that's a zero-sum game that hurts everyone.\" The hunt for help The companies that do have the resources to recruit outside of Austin are finding it's not always the answer. Fast-growing Spiceworks, which develops software that helps companies manage their networks, took part in the technology council's Silicon Valley trip and pursued its own recruiting efforts there. \"Unless they've raised their hand and said, 'I'm coming to Texas,' you go to a lot of trouble, and then they bail,\" said CEO Scott Abel . \"I'm not going to pay the California wages, which can be 30 percent higher. But the bigger problem is the density of startups there is so high, people realize, 'Why would I leave?' \" Of the 50 employees Spiceworks added last year, all but eight were already in Austin. The company, which now has 120 employees, plans to hire 60 more in sales, marketing and development next year \u2014 more of whom will probably come from outside of Texas. \"We're going to do more college recruiting and also focus on the Northeast,\" Abel said. \"It's much easier to get people there who want to get out of the cold and come to Austin.\" As Spiceworks grows, it's able to add less experienced employees and supplement their skills with training. But most new companies aren't in that position, said Marc Davis , CEO of Austin recruiting firm HireStarter.com. \"With a young startup company, training is not an option. Skill sets are so in demand, and funding for startups has gone down. Nobody has time to hire people who don't have the skill sets,\" Davis said. \"I don't have a warehouse of these people, so I have to yank them out of somewhere.\" That's led to a jump in counteroffers by companies trying to keep their people, he said. \"We've had candidates get an extra $30,000 just to stay,\" he said. \"Their managers say it is worth it because otherwise they have to pay a headhunter, and they'll lose time and money getting a new candidate up to speed.\" Austin salaries vary greatly, depending on the size of the company and its ability to raise venture capital. For top-level, experienced software programmers with key skills, pay can range from $130,000 to $150,000 a year, up from $100,000 to $120,000 over the past couple of years, according to HireStarter.com. Senior software engineers with experience in traditional programming languages like C++ can earn between $100,000 and $120,000, and workers with mobile programming skills can make $120,000 to $150,000. Some established software startups are paying \"north of $150,000 for programmers. That was almost unheard of before,\" Davis said. 'Import that talent' Austin's first software talent crunch came in the mid-1990s, when a promising group of new companies, including Trilogy Software, Tivoli Systems and Vignette Corp., received venture financing and began expanding. They quickly found there weren't enough Internet-savvy programmers to go around, so they began recruiting from outside Austin. Trilogy was the most aggressive and creative. It launched Trilogy University, which incorporated both a national recruiting effort and a boot camp to bring in talented young workers and quickly acclimate them. \"We said the only thing to do is to import that talent ,\" said John Price, a former Trilogy executive who now heads another startup, Vast.Com. \" We spent millions of dollars bringing talent to town. We were one of the only companies in the country beating Microsoft to the top talent.\" Price estimates Trilogy brought 1,000 or more workers to Austin over the years. Many of them stayed in Austin even after the Internet boom went bust in 2001. And many of those have become key executives in today's new group of local tech startups. These days, there are no comparable large-scale recruiting efforts in place restocking the area's talent base. That means local companies often find themselves fighting over the same workers. At Whaleshark Media, which runs online deals and coupon websites, nearly every engineer the company makes an offer to also receives offers from other companies. \"Rather than competing against one other firm, you're competing against four or five other firms,\" said Matt Howitt, who weighed a number of offers before joining Whaleshark as vice president of engineering two months ago. Even though it's more established than a fledgling startup, Whaleshark competes with much bigger players, including Facebook and Google, which are expanding here. Whaleshark grew from 30 employees to 100 over the past year and plans to add up to 50 next year. Even with deep pockets \u2014 Whaleshark has raised $300 million in venture capital \u2014 finding the right people is the company's biggest challenge, said CEO Cotter Cunningham . The company has started offering up to $2,000 for any employee who makes a successful referral. And it is sweetening its perks: Breakfast and lunch are catered several times a week; there's no vacation policy \u2014 employees can take what they want ; and new employees can choose their own computer system and get a cellphone allowance. \"Those things are what it takes to stand out,\" Cunningham said. 'A beacon on Austin' There is no overnight fix for the software talent crunch, but several potential solutions have been suggested by local tech entrepreneurs and the Chamber of Commerce. Rollins, the chamber president, said his organization is \"neck deep\" in discussions with several area schools, including Austin Community College and UT, to push for programs that would offer training in cutting-edge software skills to workers who already have technical degrees. Rollins said he expects one or more schools in the region to offer a program to address that in the next six to 12 months. Part of the answer could come from UT, where the computer science department is seeing student enrollment expand and is working with local companies to create more specialized programs, including game development and mobile applications development. Department chairman Bruce Porter said computer science enrollment has grown to about 1,340 students this year compared with a low of about 800 in the years after the first Internet bust. \"We are expanding, but the demand from industry is growing faster than our uptick in enrollment. I am guessing we are going to see an increasingly severe talent crunch over the next five years,\" he said. UT is talking with local startups, but Porter noted that larger, better-known companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co., Google and Facebook, also compete for UT students. Despite interest from national tech employers, Porter said two-thirds of his department's graduates remain in Texas. Tech companies need more incentive programs to lure students into studying software development and engineering, said Larry Warnock , CEO of cloud computing startup Gazzang and a member of the Austin Technology Council. Another part of the solution, said Price, the former Trilogy executive, is to create a collaborative recruiting effort that would be backed by local software companies and other business organizations. He said Austin needs to target the young tech developers who come to town each spring for the South by Southwest Interactive Conference. \"The idea is to put a beacon on Austin and the Austin tech scene to bring in large numbers of people. Without a program like this, we have no chance of growing,\" Price said. \"We are going to solve this problem. And it will take time. We ought to have a five-year time horizon. We will get the influx of talent. It is going to be hard work. And companies will have to step up with their pocketbooks and their time.\" Although it doesn't look as if the Technology Council's Silicon Valley visit will bring many new brains here, participants say it paid off by raising awareness of Austin as a technology hub. More trips are being planned, possibly to Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and the Northeast, Warnock said. \"We want to get the word out that Austin is a great place to live,\" he said. \"It's not just about Silicon Valley. It's Chicago; it's New York; it's about importing talent from wherever we can find it.\" WHAT AUSTIN SEEKS Here are some of the skills software companies are searching for: User interface This refers to the look and feel of a software application and how users interact with it. It has become a high-\u2028demand skill as companies seek applications that look cool and are fun to work with. Mobile applications Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, impose different constraints and require different kinds of programming skills from standard personal computer programs. These applications are usually on Apple iOS or Android, which are relatively new environments. Cloud computing The world is moving toward cloud computing to gain efficiency and flexibility. The new software developed for clouds demands different kinds of code to take advantage of the flexibility of computing clusters. The real mind shift in cloud development is the notion of \u2018infinite resources' where capabilities can expand immediately. Most cloud environments are built on open source infrastructure and require that expertise. About this story Lori Hawkins and Kirk Ladendorf are veteran technology reporters at the American-\u2028Statesman. In their conversations with startups and CEOs, they have heard frequently about a shortage of software engineers and other highly skilled technology workers. Realizing that the labor crunch has become one of the most pressing issues for the Austin \u2028software industry, they went to work exploring the issue \u2014 both what is causing it and what can be done to address it.

Only sixteen Packard Fellowships were awarded this year across all of science and engineering. His research focuses on finding new methods to secure stored data by encryption. He is laying the foundations for an entirely different vision for encryption that he calls Functional Encryption.  With Functional Encryption, instead of encrypting to individual users, one can embed how they want to share data in the encryption process. Decryption is self-enforcing, allowing encrypted data to be stored on untrusted locations such as cloud storage sites. About Packard Fellowships for Science and Engineering In 1988, the Packard Foundation established the Fellowships for Science and Engineering to allow the nation\u2019s most promising professors to pursue science and engineering research early in their careers with few funding restrictions and limited reporting requirements. From unraveling the mysteries of aging, to studying emerging virus strains for rapid detection and prevention, to better understanding the physics of insect flight, research performed in university laboratories has the ability to profoundly impact our lives. Each year, the Foundation invites the presidents of 50 universities to nominate two early-career professors each from their institutions. An advisory panel of distinguished scientists and engineers carefully reviews the nominations and selects 16 Fellows to receive individual grants of $875,000, distributed over five years. Packard Fellows must be faculty members who are eligible to serve as principal investigators engaged in research in the natural and physical sciences or engineering, and must be within the first three years of their faculty careers. Disciplines that are considered include physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, astronomy, computer science, earth science, ocean science, and all branches of engineering. Candidates engaged in research in the social sciences are not considered. Packard Fellows are encouraged to think big and look at complex issues with a fresh perspective. The Foundation has few paperwork requirements, and Fellows may use their funds in whatever way would best advance their research. Today, more than 400 university professors in science and engineering have received Packard Fellowships totaling more than $230 million. Packard Fellows have gone on to receive additional awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics; the Fields Medal; and MacArthur, Sloan, Searle, and Guggenheim fellowships.

SunGard Availability Services, based in Wayne, Pa., plans to make a \"high six-figure\" investment in the center, said Indu Kodukula, executive vice president and chief technology officer at the company. The cloud computing center will initially have four or five faculty members assigned to it, said Bruce Porter, chair of UT's computer sciences department. The center's research will focus on areas such as mobile computing, networking, verification, fraud protection and encryption, officials said, and will include developing approaches to protecting data as it traverses the cloud and the Internet. \"Cloud computing today is still in the early stages of development. As an industry, it's still very much in its infancy. There are a number of problems that need to be solved in the next five to 10 years,\" Kodukula said. He said his company rated UT highly both for its research prowess and its openness in working with industry to commercialize research discoveries. The center will begin operation almost immediately, Porter said, and will eventually be housed in the new Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex, which is scheduled to open in late 2012. Porter said that UT became aware about nine months ago that SunGard was looking for a research university to join with on the project and that UT is \"always looking for opportunities to find a good partner from the industry in some research area that we're interested in.\" \"We have built strength in the areas that relate to cloud computing \u2014 distributing computing, operating systems, fiber security,\" Porter said. \"This is going to give us a chance to explore research topics in these areas, really at full scale. Oftentimes, a university researcher is left with building relatively small prototypes of a computer system, or maybe even running computer simulations. But with this partnership, we'll be able to collect data and look at the performance of full-scale systems that are built on research results coming out of this partnership.\" SunGard Availability Services is a subsidiary of SunGard , a leading software and IT services company with about 20,000 employees and annual revenue of about $5 billion. bharrell@statesman.com ; 912-2960 News Categories Industry Relations Research Tags In the News",

Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, November 1, 2011 The new Game Development Program is designed to serve undergraduate students in Radio-TV-Film , Fine Arts and Computer Science . Students majoring in these areas will take classes in their discipline. After gaining experience, and typically in their senior year at UT, students from these three disciplines will come together in an interdisciplinary Capstone Project class. Students interested in applying for Capstone Projects in Game Development and Design can be registered in any department or program of study at UT. Students currently in Computer Science, Radio-TV-Film, Music, and/or Design are urged to take as many pertinent courses within their program of study as possible in preparation for the Capstone. Admission to the Capstone Project will be competitive. Students will be asked to submit a resume and a portfolio of their game-related work. The portfolio may be software, designs, animations, 3D artwork, music and sound design examples, game stories, etc. In short, anything that will demonstrate exceptional skills in one or more areas of game development.

    "text_content": "Science Student Entrepreneurs Give A Hoot | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Science Student Entrepreneurs Give A Hoot Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, November 7, 2011 Natural sciences students Sid Upadhyay and Gaurav Sanghani, in partnership with business student Michael Koetting, are behind the creation of Hoot.Me , a Facebook application that allows students to collaborate on schoolwork in a variety of ways, even in subjects such as calculus with complex mathematical equations. The application gives students the ability to search for other students at their university who are working on the same subject and create study sessions. After finding a study session, multi-person video chatting helps participants collaborate with more than just one other student, and a smart chat feature gives them the ability to type in math equations easily. \u201cThe exciting part about our site is that the barrier to learning is almost completely gone,\u201d said Upadhyay, a third-year mathematics and business honors major and chief technology officer at Hoot.Me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be this huge corporation to do something like this. You just have to be really dedicated.\u201d Professors can use the site to hold virtual office hours or question and answer sessions. A Twitter-like tagging and hash-tagging system allows students to follow or un-follow questions and ask or answer questions effectively, without having to sort through questions they already know. \u201cWe have truly created the science behind our own business,\u201d Upadhyay added. \u201cIt\u2019s like our child. There are layers of management. In our day-to-day, we fix bugs, build video technology, brainstorm new ideas as well as listen for feedback from students who use the site.\u201d Initially, Koetting, a third year business honors and finance major who serves as Hoot.Me\u2019s CEO, came up with a business plan to create a new type of collaboration network and a way for knowledge to be shared. A professor suggested that Koetting collaborate with his classmate Upadhyay on the project. Koetting presented the simple proposition to Upadhyay after their freshman year, and he and Sanghani, now third year computer science major, decided to hop on board. \u201cAt first, it was all just an idea because we didn\u2019t know how to do any of it,\u201d said Sanghani, chief engineer for Hoot.Me. \u201cSid and I started the design portion during the summer, trying to visit each others\u2019 houses because we both live in the same city.\u201d After a few months of development, Koetting and Upadhyay took the idea to 3 Day Startup in Austin. \u201cThe idea behind 3 Day Startup is that you bring 40 people together and have them pitch ideas on Friday night, work on the chosen ideas through Saturday, and pitch to a panel of judges on Sunday,\u201d Koetting said. \u201cThe judging panel included entrepreneurs from Austin as well as people from companies such as Facebook.\u201d After positive feedback there, the group decided to take the plan to StartupCamp3, where the idea for Hoot.Me won the competition, which was judged by Google officials and other well-known technology firms. \u201cStartupCamp and 3 Day Startup were real world experiences that gave us the confidence to take Hoot.Me from an idea to a company,\u201d Koetting said. \u201cAnd, this is why we set our sights on New York City.\u201d The business plan was accepted in DreamIt Ventures and the Start1\u2019s accelerator program in New York in the summer of 2011 and eventually evolved into what it is today. \u201cWhen it came to creating the system and software, there was a lot we had to teach ourselves,\u201d Upadhyay said. \u201cIn our beginning computer science classes at UT there was a focus on how we should build these types of things but the rest was trial and error, like in the real world. I apply everything I learned in my classes everyday I work with Hoot.Me. Even if we weren\u2019t taught something specifically, I have a good foundation of how to reach our goal.\u201d Although they didn\u2019t take any formal entrepreneurship classes at the university, the group is excited about increased interest building in freshmen and other students who want to start their own companies. \u201cA lot of freshman are learning to do start ups and want to be CTOs and CEOs,\u201d Sanghani said. \u201cBoth Austin and the university are becoming great places for start ups. Things are going in a good direction, and the faculty and staff of the university are playing a huge role, even creating classes such as Mobile Development and other classes that give students the knowledge and skills they need.\u201d Photos by Sasha Haagensen .

She has also studied cancer and epilepsy off-campus. Patil is one of many student researchers who will soon have the opportunity to utilize high-end technology used by professionals across the U.S. Because of $27 million in funding from the National Science Foundation, the Texas Advanced Computing Center will build a new supercomputer in the J.J. Pickle Research Center by 2013. The supercomputer could be extremely useful to student researchers at UT if they are aware of it, because many research opportunities are not advertised enough to students, Patil said. \u201cPersonally, research has been teaching me how to do real-life problem solving that I would never do in a classroom,\u201c she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about approaching these complex questions. I think the computer would be a really cool thing to get involved with if students knew about it, because there are a lot of research opportunities here that students just don\u2019t know about.\u201d The new supercomputer will be available for use by some student researchers until the grant is up for renewal in 2017. The computer, which will be known as Stampede, will provide students with the opportunity to research with fewer limitations, said NSF spokeswoman Lisa-Joy Zgorski. http://youtu.be/CAniNH4O1O0 \u201cThe merit review panel that evaluated TACC\u2019s proposal for the computer was no doubt impressed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat TACC brought forth was a powerful combination of system and services for open science research, a key element of what this system will enable.\u201d Stampede\u2019s system will allow student researchers to be involved in advanced computation they have not yet had the opportunity to deal with, Zgorski said. According to a press release, Stampede will run on NSF\u2019s \u201ceXtreme Digital\u201d program, which runs the majority of NSF\u2019s high end computational resources available to researchers in the U.S. It will support professional research projects from across the U.S. as well as from student researchers involved in advanced computational science and technology. \u201cThis will allow student researchers to study and research some of the most vexing challenges we have in our nation today,\u201d Zgorski said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pushing the limits of science and research, and that\u2019s our goal in everything we do.\u201d Stampede will open up new windows of opportunity for students researching sciences at UT, said computer science senior Jeremy Shapiro. \u201cI\u2019m sure it would benefit my education in computer sciences,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that much technology and money put into it, it could make researching something so much quicker and more efficient.\u201d Printed on September 30, 2011 as: $27m in supercomputer grants incite Stampede of knowledge News Categories Industry Relations Tags Advanced Computer Center National Science Foundation supercomputer",

    "text_content": "Professor works with graduate students, undergrads to develop robot technology | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor works with graduate students, undergrads to develop robot technology Posted by Staci R Norman on Sunday, November 13, 2011 The Daily Texan | by Henry Clayton Wickham As an educator, associate computer science professor Peter Stone has a unique perspective on who, or what, can learn. Stone has spent his time at UT working with students to develop intelligent robots capable of learning and adapting to their environments. He is the director of the Learning Agents Research Group and works with graduate students developing and programming complex robots that compete in international contests, such as the RoboCup for soccer and the Urban Challenge for autonomous vehicles \u2014 cars that drive themselves. The soccer RoboCup has a league with real robots and a league where teams program virtual robots to play in a simulation with near lifelike conditions. Last July, the UT team made its seventh appearance in the RoboCup. The team ranked among the top eight in the real robot competition and won first place in the soccer simulation. The key to their success in the simulation league, where virtual robots play soccer on a virtual field, Stone said, was a machine-learning algorithm they used to develop a walk that outpaced all the other teams. Rather than spend tedious hours trying out different virtual walks and fine-tuning the best one, Stone and his team created a program with parameters that allowed robots to perfect a walk on their own through a kind of automated trial and error. \u201cIt was our secret weapon. We could not have hand-coded anything nearly as good. Most of the other teams were doing it by hand, and we beat them because we did it with learning,\u201d Stone said. In recent years, undergraduates as well as grad students have gotten involved with LARG through its Freshman Research Initiative course, which deals with automated driving. The Freshman Research Initiative is a program in the College of Natural Sciences that gives freshmen the opportunity to get involved with research. Stone said the initiative has allowed more undergraduates to play an important role in LARG\u2019s research than would have been possible otherwise. Stone taught the first FRI class for autonomous driving in 2007 and brought along six undergraduates when his group\u2019s vehicle qualified for the finals of the Urban Challenge. He now supervises a research educator who teaches the course. \u201cWe had about a tenth the budget of some of the other teams, and most of them said they wouldn\u2019t let an undergrad touch the car with a 10-foot pole, whereas we had students in this class changing the code and hacking in the starting gates up to the last minute,\u201d Stone said. The LARG\u2019s autonomous car, which is kept at the Pickle Research Campus, drives reliably at 30 mph, performs three-point turns and can reroute itself when confronted with road blocks or other unexpected barriers. The car has a camera that it uses to identify other vehicles or obstacles in the road, but it relies on differential GPS to stay on the road. By connecting with multiple satellites, the car can determine its position within 50 centimeters \u2014 a commercial GPS system is only reliable within 50 meters. Stone said that in many ways, the technology for a fully functioning autonomous car is already available, but there are legal and economic barriers that have to be removed before self-driving cars become a viable option. \u201cCan we make a car that is a better driver than a person? Arguably, that\u2019s not that hard of a task given what we have right now,\u201d Stone said. \u201cPartly because people aren\u2019t very good drivers.\u201d Printed on Monday, November 14, 2011 as: Professor, students develop complex robots News Categories Faculty Graduate Students Research Tags RoboCup robotics Artificial Intelligence Peter Stone",

    "text_content": "Texas university to build powerful supercomputer | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Texas university to build powerful supercomputer Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, September 22, 2011 CNN | Joshua Rubin | September 22, 2011 -- Updated 2049 GMT (0449 HKT) Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Maybe everything really is bigger in Texas. The Lonestars, a series of blazingly fast supercomputers, put the Texas Advanced Computing Center on the map in 2003. Then came the Ranger system, which was more than 100 times more powerful than the first Lonestar computers. Now, with a $27 million grant from the National Science Foundation, a new supercomputer is set to raise the bar again at the center, located at the University of Texas at Austin. Called Stampede, it's expected to come online in 2013. If it were running today, TACC officials say, it would be the world's fastest supercomputer. \"Building these very powerful computing systems enables researchers who are at the forefront of certain fields to ask deeper questions, to run bigger simulations, to test their theories at the boundaries of what we currently know, and that helps push those boundaries back,\" says TACC director Jay Boisseau. At the heart of Stampede will be two kinds of Intel processors. More than 12,000 eight-core Xeon E5 processors will combine to produce 2 petaflops -- a measure of a computer's processing speed. But the bulk of the raw processing power, an astounding 8 petaflops, will come from Intel\u00b9s newest MIC (many integrated core) chips, which have more than 50 processing cores per unit. The Stampede supercomputer will be the first major rollout of these new chips, TACC scientists say. Once completed, the system will be able to perform 10 quadrillion operations per second, making it one of the fastest computers on the planet. By comparison, IBM's massive Watson computer, which beat two human rivals on \"Jeopardy!\" earlier this year, is much less powerful. Moore\u00b9s Law predicts the doubling of computer processing speed about every two years, but advances in supercomputing have allowed systems such as Stampede to increase in power at an even faster rate. Scientists like Omar Ghattas see great potential in the exponentially more powerful Stampede computer. A professor of geosciences at the University of Texas, Ghattas has used supercomputers to track everything from the global impact of March's Japan earthquake to how melting ice sheets in Antarctica will increase sea levels. The more powerful the machine, the more data points can be processed. \"It's like resolution in a camera -- we\u00b9re always trying to increase the pixels in our cameras,\" Ghattas told CNN. \"Well, it\u00b9s the same sort of thing that happens with supercomputers when you are using mathematical models that represent complex physical phenomena. We have equations, differential equations that represent these phenomenon, and we solve them on a grid and we\u00b9re trying to get better and better resolution.\" The current holder of the World's Fastest Computer title is the K computer, which was brought online in June at a computing institute in Kobe, Japan, and has a peak performance of 8.162 petaflops. At a theoretical top speed of 10 petaflops, the Stampede system would beat that, but because it won't become operational for several years, newer supercomputers will likely surpass it by then. Supercomputing is revolutionizing open research within the global scientific community, based on the idea that scientific knowledge -- and access to supercomputers -- should be openly shared and available to all. TACC scientists estimate that once the Stampede system is completed, it will help process more than 1,000 different research studies every year. Time on the system will be free, but access will be granted based on a national peer-review board of scientists. The Stampede supercomputer also is a monster in terms of energy consumption. Once operational, it is expected to gobble approximately 9 megawatts of power per year -- about the amount used by 9,000 single-family homes. TACC already has one power substation on the university campus, but to accommodate future growth the center may need another. This is a large expense, but University of Texas President William Powers is firmly behind the center and its research. \"We\u00b9re very proud of the fact that this is going to be a worldwide asset, but it's Texas built, kind of homegrown. That design that we started with Ranger and Lonestar and now Stampede, that design in of itself is a great breakthrough,\" he says. \"So we\u00b9re proud of the computer, but we\u00b9re also proud of being on the leading edge of designing how supercomputers work, communicate, and interface with the scientific community.\" News Categories Industry Relations Tags Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC supercomputer NSF National Science Foundation innovation cyberinfrastructure computational resources",

Through this lecture series, faculty presented insights into computer science research and education to the public and the computing community. Watch the 2011 Visions of Computing Lecture! Raymond Mooney - \"Learning Natural Language from its Perceptual Context\" Machine learning has become the best approach to building systems that comprehend human language. However, current systems require a great deal of laboriously constructed human-annotated training data. Ideally, a computer would be able to acquire language like a child by being exposed to linguistic input in the context of a relevant but ambiguous perceptual environment.  As a step in this direction, we have developed systems that learn to sportscast simulated robot soccer games and to follow navigation instructions in virtual environments by simply observing sample human linguistic behavior.  This work builds on our earlier work on supervised learning of semantic parsers that map natural language into a formal meaning representation.  In order to apply such methods to learning from observation, we have developed methods that estimate the meaning of sentences from just their ambiguous perceptual context. About Raymond Mooney Awarded Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery Raymond J. Mooney is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. He is an author of over 150 published research papers, primarily in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing. He was the President of the International Machine Learning Society from 2008-2011, was program co-chair for the 2006 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, general chair of the 2005 Human Language Technology Conference and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, and co-chair of the 1990 International Conference on Machine Learning.

His recent research has focused on learning for natural-language processing, connecting language and perception, statistical relational learning, and transfer learning. William Press - \"Visions of a National Learning Health Care System\" As health information becomes increasingly electronic, many improvements in health care delivery, and in the science underlying medical advances, become possible.  This talk will review some of these and highlight where they suggest important research agendas in computer science. About William Press Named Vice Chair of PCAST and President Elect of AAAS William H. Press is the Warren J. and Viola M. Raymer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin.  Previously, he was Deputy Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Press is a current member of President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.  He is also President-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Tandy Warnow - \"Recent breakthroughs in mathematical and computational phylogenetics\" Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary history of a set of species (or genes), and are important for much biological research. Almost all of the methods used to construct phylogenetic trees are computationally very intensive (typically being based upon attempts to solve NP-hard optimization problems),  most make unrealistic assumptions about the evolutionary process, and few have been tested under realistic conditions.  In this talk I will describe recent breakthroughs in phylogenetic analysis, including mathematical results regarding estimation under stochastic models of evolution, and novel algorithmic approaches that provide higher accuracy on biological and simulated datasets.

Encrypting Data in the Cloud Brings Win for Texas | By Nicolas Zeitler | Aug 10, 2011 3:20 PM For his work on the foundations of a new way of encrypting data, Brent Waters from the University of Texas in Austin has been elected as one of this year's Microsoft Research Faculty Fellows. Waters' main research interests are in cryptography and computer security. His work addresses the increasing trend toward cloud computing, and he is looking to lay the foundations for a new model to secure data stored in the cloud. Third-party data centers where companies store their data have been high-value targets for attackers, Waters said. To prevent customer data from being leaked it should be stored in encrypted form only. \"The problem is that traditional encryption systems do not work with many cloud applications,\" he said. They were designed only for sharing and exchanging data between single known users. That traditional approach does not meet the needs of an enterprise storing data in the cloud that should be shared by huge groups of users, particularly if some users do not even exist in the system at the time the data is encrypted. For instance, a sales person could be hired after data he or she needs for work is being encrypted and saved in a cloud data center. Waters wants to solve problems like this with so-called functional encryption. \"It is a totally different vision for encryption,\" he said. Unlike traditional encryption where data is encrypted to individual users, with functional encryption one would embed certain access predicates directly into the ciphertext, Waters said. These predicates would also be attributed to users depending on their access rights to certain data, Waters said. A sales person, for instance, would have credentials different from those of a manager. \"If someone gets a certain attribute at a later time he will also be able to get access to the data,\" Waters said. This means an employee being promoted to a higher position would get new attributes and then be able to gain access to data available to managers only. Waters said the system would be secure against so-called colluding users. If two people with different credentials tried to use them in combination to access encrypted data not available for people in their position, they would not get access, he said. Waters' vision is that this principle of functional encryption could one day work with any function. A possible application would be in image encryption, Waters said. With this it would, for example, be possible to partially decrypt a picture of a group of people. Only a user who has been identified by facial recognition software could then see exactly the part of the image that shows him. \"At the moment we cannot do this, but I believe we will be able to someday,\" Waters said. Waters said he was proud of the fellowship. \"The interview process was very challenging and getting the grant for unrestricted use means they trust you and believe in your work,\" he said. Waters said he has not decided yet how he'll spend the US$200,000 grant coming with the Microsoft fellowship. He said maybe he would use a part of it to fund a sabbatical leave. \"I enjoy doing research at the University of Texas at Austin and I like teaching -- but it would be great to clear my schedule for maybe a year to have time to think and work closely with some researchers in California I have a special relationship with,\" he said. Waters received his Ph.D. and Master of Arts in computer science from Princeton University in 2004 and 2002, respectively. In 2000 he finished his Bachelor of Science in computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles. News Categories Research Faculty Awards & Honors Tags In the News Brent Waters",

    "text_content": "Colleges That Help Grads Get Top Salaries | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Colleges That Help Grads Get Top Salaries Posted by Staci R Norman on Thursday, August 11, 2011 SMARTMONEY MAGAZINE | By CHAD TERHUNE & MATTHEW HEIMER | AUGUST 11, 2011, 2:48 P.M. ET At a recent freshmen orientation in Austin, Ott says, another dad shared how Texas helped his son land a well-paying job in computer science at a Houston oil services firm after a summer internship. \"The fellow said his son is making more money straight out of college than he did after 30 years,\" Paul Ott recalls. Both the elder and younger Ott say they'd be more than happy with a graduation present like that. I t's the kind of calculation that ruffles the robes of administrators at the most prestigious universities in the country. It's a blunt bottom-line approach to a postsecondary education, a show-me-the-money college survey. And it's one academic contest that the Ivies don't win. For decades, the best-known college rankings have tried to encompass everything from alumni giving and \"academic reputation\" to dorm amenities. But a few years ago, SmartMoney stripped all that away in favor of a simpler benchmark. With help from PayScale, a Seattle-based compensation-data company that maintains salary profiles of 29 million workers, we collected median pay figures for two pools of each school's alums: recent grads (who've been out of school for an average of two years) and midcareer types (an average of 15 years out). For each class, we divided the median alumnus salary by tuition and fees (assuming they paid full price at then-current rates), averaged the results and, finally, converted that result to a percentage figure. The outcome: a measure of return on (tuition) investment that we've dubbed the Payback Score. For example, a hypothetical grad who spent $100,000 to attend college and now earns $150,000 a year would score 150. The higher the score, obviously, the better. It's admittedly an imperfect bit of math. It doesn't take into account financial aid, at a time when schools say they're increasing it. Nor does it include a host of intangible factors that can make any education more valuable. But a growing number of parents and applicants are giving such calculus more weight, in the face of the steady, recession-proof rise in college costs: Private tuition has increased 70 percent since 2001, to an average of more than $27,000 annually, according to the College Board; public tuition more than doubled over the same stretch. What's worse, a weak job market has made it harder for grads to pay off student loans. Steven Roy Goodman, a college admissions consultant in Washington, D.C., says even the most prestigious schools have more questions to answer about their alumni incomes. \"You have to look at the yield from your education,\" he says. \"Not everybody who goes to Columbia becomes a multimillionaire.\" Maybe not, but the average Columbia grad can expect to earn $100,000 a year by her mid-30s, according to PayScale -- 2 percent more than a graduate of a top-priced public university at the same stage of life. So does that justify the extra 50 grand that he or she might pay for an Ivy League education, NYC-style? You decide. To help in the process, we used our pragmatic dollars-and-cents metric to examine 50 schools at the highest end of the cost spectrum: the eight Ivies, plus more than 40 of the most expensive non-Ivy private schools and public universities (based on what they charge out-of-state students). We then determined an overall payback ranking as well as a ranking by category. Here, the full transcript on America's best and worst college deals. The Ivy League Avg. payback score: 94 Avg. salary for recent grads: $55,463 Avg. salary for midcareer grads: $112,838 In any discussion of college expenses, the gold-plated cost of an Ivy League degree quickly becomes Topic A. Among this elite sisterhood of schools, four years of full-price tuition and fees for the class of 2009 averaged just under $138,000 -- 82 percent more than what members of the class of 1996 paid. In response to this soaring bill, many of the schools have dramatically boosted financial-aid packages -- tapping endowment money for grants in order to keep families (even modestly affluent ones) from having to borrow heavily to pay for college. Princeton, the top-finishing Ivy in our survey, was the first one to pledge to give grants, rather than loans, to all students qualifying for financial aid. At least 60 percent of Princeton students in the class of 2014 are receiving scholarships and other aid directly from the school, totaling around $40,000 a student. Harvard says the same is true for its incoming freshmen. That kind of largesse certainly will make life easier for aspiring Yale grad David Marcano, a valedictorian and Eagle Scout from Worcester, Mass., who will be paying less than a tenth of the school's sticker price of $56,000 for annual tuition, room and board. \"I told David, when he gets rich, he needs to do the same for other kids,\" says his mother, Ramona Gil. And certainly, if PayScale's numbers for future grads are any indication, his future income won't be hurt by his academic pedigree: Ivy grads, on average, outearn their peers from the get-go, and the earnings gap between them and top-tier public-school graduates widens over time, from about 14 percent right after graduation to 26 percent by the time they're in their 30s. Still, critics say the Ivies have a long way to go to prove they're offering as much value as the best public colleges. Even at the schools with the most generous aid policies, some students get zilch, and many comfortable-but-not-rich families are staring down the barrel of five-figure student-loan bills. Furthermore, the size of aid grants is often based on the number of children in a family, reducing the generosity for one- or two-kid households. But for many, the biggest issue may be whether Ivy League degrees still carry the same economic clout in an age when many other schools have worked hard to improve their academic credentials and where liberal-arts degrees no longer necessarily pave the way to high-paying jobs. Indeed, in a study published earlier this year, economists Alan Krueger and Stacy Dale showed that students' SAT scores are a much bigger predictor of future salaries than the school they attend. Kids whose scores were good enough to enter elite colleges eventually earned as much as graduates of those schools -- even if they went to college somewhere, well, cheaper. What do the Ivies say? Robin Moscato, Princeton's director of undergraduate financial aid, says that if all their grant aid were taken into account, the Ivies would score far better in a Payback analysis. That's a point Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust is quick to agree with -- adding, in an interview, \"I believe the experience at Harvard is unparalleled.\" Non-Ivy Private Avg. payback score: 79 Avg. salary for recent grads: $46,414 Avg. salary for midcareer grads: $94,181 It wasn't an easy decision to make. Paul Ott says his son, Evan, tops in his class and a National Merit Scholar, got into a pair of well-regarded private schools and was offered some impressive grant money to boot. But he found that even the private schools' best offers would leave Evan owing as much as $25,000 a year for tuition, room and board. The Otts, who live in Dallas, will instead send Evan down the road to the University of Texas at Austin, where in-state valedictorians attend tuition-free their first year. \"That was huge for us, because we're not well-heeled,\" says Paul Ott. Compared with the Ivies, experts say, most of the private- school sector has far fewer resources to tap for scholarships and grants. Indeed, the average Ivy League endowment was worth $10 billion at the end of 2010, while the endowment of the average college was worth only about $400 million. Not coincidentally, the schools in our study cost more to attend, on average, than the Ivies, and their tuition has grown faster since the 1990s. And the loudest howls of complaint may ultimately come from grads whose salaries don't measure up to their college bills. At midcareer, graduates of the schools in this group averaged income of $94,000 a year -- certainly respectable, but 16 percent less than Ivy grads were making and only 6 percent more than that earned by graduates of much cheaper public colleges. As for SmartMoney's Payback Score, this group gets a 79, lowest among our three categories. Some education experts blame the income lag on these schools' strong identities as liberal arts colleges, noting that those who earn the most in this job market tend to major in other subjects, like engineering or business. At Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., graduates often choose careers in education, public administration or social work, and come out earning, on average, just $38,600 after two years. (Officials at Sarah Lawrence say that figure may underestimate alumni salaries but also contend that's beside the point: \"Their rewards are measured not just by earnings but by how much they are giving back to society,\" says Tom Blum, the vice president of administration.) To be sure, many private schools don't fit the same mold. Indeed, a number of the best-scoring schools in this category -- including Carnegie Mellon University, whose recent grads earn more per year than alums of any other college in our survey -- have strong programs in business and the sciences. And as for that tuition burden, many private schools say they're doing their best to ease it: Sarah Lawrence, for one, is providing an average $31,000 in help per financial-aid recipient this year. Public Schools Avg. payback score: 141 Avg. salary for recent grads: $48,486 Avg. salary for midcareer grads: $89,662 If our payback survey were a football game, the public schools would be spiking the ball in the end zone and kissing the mascots. Among recent grads, public alumni earn annual salaries equal to 52 percent of their four years of tuition and fees; private-school kids bring in just 32 percent on average. For out-of-state students, full-fare tuition at the schools in our survey is 35 percent lower than at private colleges, but in many cases, the career options are just as strong. Ralph Mobley, director of career services at Georgia Tech, says 63 percent of May's graduating class had jobs at commencement, up from 53 percent of the class of 2010; computer science and chemical engineering majors were among the hot recruits. Of course, public colleges have some troubles of their own. As tax revenue shriveled in the recession, many states slashed the budgets of public universities. State spending per college student has fallen by about 19 percent from a decade ago, leaving many schools with bigger classes and beaten-up facilities. To close their budget gaps, politicians have been hiking tuition for out-of-state students. From 1996 to 2009 (the graduation dates of our two survey groups), the cost of a four-year nonresident degree at the schools we studied more than doubled, to $93,500. At the University of Texas at Austin, where out-of-state tuition has grown nearly 70 percent in five years, the average loan debt for undergraduates is now almost $25,000; Tom Melecki, UT's director of student financial services, says this year's budget cuts were \"unprecedented in their depth.\" Still, the budget cuts haven't yet tarnished the public schools' bargain status. And for students willing to stay in-state, the financial equation looks all the better. Paul Ott, the Dallas father who counseled his son to go to a public college where first-year tuition is free, says they are anticipating getting an additional $2,000 or more in state scholarships from the University of Texas. At a recent freshmen orientation in Austin, Ott says, another dad shared how Texas helped his son land a well-paying job in computer science at a Houston oil services firm after a summer internship. \"The fellow said his son is making more money straight out of college than he did after 30 years,\" Paul Ott recalls. Both the elder and younger Ott say they'd be more than happy with a graduation present like that. Additional reporting by Sara Germano and Jen Wieczner.

    "text_content": "Navigate the Booming Computer Science Market | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Navigate the Booming Computer Science Market Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, August 8, 2011 U.S. News & World Report | Brian Burnsed | August 8, 2011 Nick Black garnered a master's in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2010 and quickly received six-figure offers for leadership roles at several technology firms. Now at NVIDIA, a tech firm that develops components used in computers and mobile devices, he maintains that his position as a senior compiler engineer is exactly the type of job he expected out of grad school and that the interview process wasn't overly complicated. Landing a job in today's struggling economy was relatively simple for Black, in part because he received a master's degree from a top engineering school , but computer science students with either bachelor's or master's degrees are in demand now and are expected to be for the next decade. According to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report , there will be an estimated 1.8 million new IT jobs by 2018, a 22 percent jump from today's market. The industry was dealt a blow after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 following a decade of rampant speculation among investors, but the rise of cloud computing, mobile devices, and applications is fueling more demand in the sector, academic officials and hiring consultants say. \"The job market is booming,\" says Gopal Gupta, head of computer science at the University of Texas\u2014Dallas , where 80 percent of 2011 computer science students already had jobs lined up before they received their diplomas. \"With an increase in automation everywhere, the popularity of online social media, the increase in mobile devices, and countries where computing jobs are traditionally off-shored\u2014particularly India\u2014saturating their labor supply, the job prospects for young computing professionals, especially new graduates, are excellent.\" For prospective computer science students, the downside to this employment surge is the resulting increase in applicants, which will likely create tougher admissions standards at programs nationwide. George Mason University 's undergraduate computer science population has leaped by 39 percent from 344 students to 479. At Trinity University , officials are bracing for a potential influx of computer science students, and have already added an extra session of the introductory class. \"If there is a huge surge of students, we may have to consider making our major and the introductory classes more competitive\u2014maybe like premed has always been,\" says Paul Myers, professor of computer science at Trinity. Similarly, at the University of Illinois , officials note that average ACT scores of admitted computer science students have jumped over the past two years. To navigate the increasingly competitive computer science admissions process, it's integral that students focus on honing their mathematical acumen by taking advanced classes such as AP Calculus, says Daniel Gallagher, dean of admissions at the Stevens Institute of Technology . Robert Beck, chairman of Villanova University 's department of computing sciences, notes that taking part in tech-centric extracurriculars could help your chances as well. \"Even if there aren't computing courses in the high school\u2014and in many places there are not\u2014students can look for a computing club; a robotics competition; a Web design project to give themselves a little practice,\" he says. Once students get past the admissions hurdle, their career prospects are typically bright. At Michigan Technological University , for instance, where more than 300 students major in computer science or software engineering, 93 percent of 2010 undergraduate computer science students had jobs by graduation. Not only are students finding jobs at above-average rates, they're among the best paid out of college, according to a recent survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Computer science majors in the class of 2011 garnered an average starting salary of $63,017, second only to chemical engineers who make $66,886, on average. At some top schools like Illinois, average starting salaries are even higher. There, the most recent class of 175 computer science graduates attained an average starting salary of $72,597.

That was me. You know that dad who yells so much on the sideline that he leaves the game a little hoarse? Yeah, that was me too. You know the dad who cheers when his kid brings home an A? No? Well me neither ... until I became that dad a few years ago. I used to beam with pride watching my son rack up the trophies as he bounced from soccer to hockey to tae kwon do. Over the past couple of years, track has been his focus, as he crushed several school records during citywide meets. What can I say? My kid's a stud. But one thing I've noticed over the years is that while everyone from his coaches to other parents and even family members are quick to point out his potential to earn a college scholarship, they do so with all of the emphasis on his athletic prowess. No one -- and I mean, no one -- ever brings up his grades, a shame considering he has a 3.86 in an international baccalaureate program, studies Chinese, currently is in debate camp and has wanted to go to Stanford since the fifth grade. Cornell's his back up plan. In short, as good as he is in sports, I'm not raising him with the hopes of him being a jock. I'm raising him to be a nerd. And I couldn't be happier. And by happier, I don't mean the lukewarm \"well, at least he's not selling drugs\" kind, but the same genuine thrill I used to reserve only for the trophy ceremony at the end of tournaments. Jocks go on to play for your favorite team but nerds go on to own the teams for which those jocks play. Jocks go on to play for your favorite team but nerds go on to own the teams those jocks play for. --LZ Granderson I know it's hard to find a job in this economy. But I also know that at the beginning of the year, Google gave its employees a $1,000 bonus and a 10% raise because it kept losing its brightest employees to competitors, so somebody's hiring. And it looks as if they're hiring nerds. I was shocked during the GOP debate earlier this month that in two hours no candidate brought up education. They all talked about job creation and innovation but not education, as if they were not connected. We know because of our culture's negative attitude toward nerds, our kids are discouraged from being bookish from an early age. We also know that there is a high drop out rate for college students in nerdy subjects such as science and math, which in turn affects how the country competes globally in fields such as medicine and engineering. So to me, there can be no innovation and job creation talks without talking about education. At times, my son gets concerned that his bookish qualities may interfere with his social life. I just remind him that in the heart of hard economic times, 33 of 50 states increased the amount spent on prisons while decreasing dollars spent on K-12 and higher education. So while he's worrying about being cool, the job market is getting smaller and more competitive and our government is preparing to send more people to jail. But again, it starts with me. I finally figured out that if I wanted my son to really embrace education, I had to take the lead. Not by downplaying his accomplishments on the field but by elevating the importance of his work in the classroom. So I smile in the doorway when I walk into a room to see him reading for fun the same way I smile when I look out into the backyard to see him working on his dribbling. It sounds a bit odd, I will admit, but if exuberant positive reinforcement is acceptable for tossing a ball in a hoop, why is it out of place to be just as excited for our kids getting good grades? Being good students. Being, dare I say, a nerd? American kids my son's age rank 14th in reading, 17th in science and 25th in math and it's not because of bad teachers and a broken public school system. OK, it's not just because of those things. We also don't believe in the value of education, culturally -- we just like to say we do because as citizens of an industrialized nation, we're supposed to. But we can tell our children that school is important until we're blue in the face, they're not stupid. They see the loudest applause is for the kids on the field. They know teachers are paid poorly and don't drive fancy cars. They know people plan Super Bowl parties but mock the National Spelling Bee. In other words, they see the hypocrisy, and we can't expect society to correct itself. If we want to have any lasting influence on the way our kids approach education -- the way future generations approach education -- then we have to grab our pom-poms and paint our faces and celebrate intellectual curiosity with the same vigor we do their athletic achievements.

    "text_content": "Worried about jobs, college women go 'geek' | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Worried about jobs, college women go 'geek' Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, June 28, 2011 A year ago, Harvard University's student newspaper dubbed computer science the most \"gender-skewed\" major on campus \u2013 meaning that many more men majored in computer science than women. Then something happened. In a year, the number of women majoring in computer science has nearly doubled on the Harvard campus. \"Computer science seems like a lot of fun, but it also proves to be a lifesaver,\" says Katrina Wong, a Harvard literature major who is considering switching to computer science. Since her father lost his job to the recession and she maxed out her credit cards, she's begun writing content for smart-phone apps that her college friends are creating for clients. \"It's not a big income, but it buys me necessities as well as opens doors to profit-sharing opportunities.\" The financial turmoil of the last few years has made it tougher for college graduates to find jobs. So women at several elite schools are turning to computer science \u2013 a field that they used to spurn \u2013 in hopes of landing secure employment opportunities after graduation. Their numbers are still small, but the influx of women into computer science programs may change the geeky male-dominated major into something far more cool. \"Men still seem to occupy the technology space,\" says Henry Chen, managing director of POM Partners, a New York-based digital-media advisory and consulting firm. But \"compared with 10 years ago, we are slowly seeing more women enter the space.\" An important catalyst driving women into the field of computer science is the concerted effort made by many schools to encourage women to do so. At the University of California, Berkeley, the director of diversity in the department of electrical engineering and computer science is spearheading a drive to get women into the field. The University of Texas [Department of Computer Science] hosts a free one-week camp for 60 high school girls called First Bytes . As the pool of female computer science majors grows, one result may be that they encourage others to sign up. That's what's happening with Ms. Wong at Harvard. Two of her friends, both computer science majors, are urging her to switch. \"They just thrive on problem solving,\" Wong says. Given the state of the economy, it's a message that a growing number of college women may tune in to. Read the full Fox 12 Oregon article, Worried about jobs, college women go 'geek' by Ilana Green.

Mike and Calvin are two of just seven UT faculty who got the award this year.The awards are given to faculty members who demonstrate extraordinary classroom performance and innovation at the undergraduate level. The UT System\u2019s vision as an \u201cinstitution of the first class\u201d includes a commitment to continuous improvement in the quality of the education its faculty provides to its students. Various programs exist at the institution and System levels to recognize teaching excellence, but few focus exclusively on undergraduate education. The Board of Regents places the highest priority on undergraduate teaching at System universities. They wish to encourage teaching excellence by recognizing those faculty who deliver the highest quality of undergraduate instruction, demonstrate their commitment to teaching, and have a history and promising future of sustained excellence with undergraduate teaching in the classroom, in the laboratory, in the field, or online. In November 2008, the Board of Regents introduced the Regents\u2019 Outstanding Teachers Awards for the nine academic institutions. The awards are a symbol of the importance they place on the provision of teaching and learning of the highest order, in recognition of those who serve our students in an exemplary manner and as an incentive for others who aspire to such service. These teaching awards will complement existing ways in which faculty excellence is recognized and incentivized.

    "text_content": "Computer Careers | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Computer Careers Posted by Staci R Norman on Friday, September 9, 2011 Source: ComputerCareersTips.com The typical vision of computer use may be a desktop PC or laptop in an office. But in actuality, any industry that requires fast communication, number crunching, data storage, high-speed graphics, or data analysis is bound to use computers and is therefore a likely source for computer careers . Computer careers are available in a wide range of industry sectors, including the military, criminal justice, education, communications, media, space exploration, construction, meteorology, medical research, and many more. Here are a few details about computer careers in some of these areas. Military: A computer career with the military offers many areas of specialty, because computers are at the heart of almost everything the armed forces do. Personnel and financial records are stored on computers. Computer models help military personnel track weather and how it might affect maneuvers. Powerful computer networks, both wired and wireless, aid communication between commanders, staff, and troops. From fighter jets to cargo planes, the safety and efficiency of military air traffic control relies on computers as well, not to mention the computers that help guide the planes themselves. In addition, much of the military\u2019s advanced equipment, such as reconnaissance drones and tracking devices, are operated using computers. An advantage of a military computer career is that the skills learned in the military transfer easily to the civilian sector. Criminal Justice : If catching the bad guys appeals to you, there are plenty of opportunities for a computer career in criminal justice. A significantly growing area is computer forensics. In this field, computers are used to investigate and solve computer security breaches and analyze data stored on computers as it pertains to criminal investigations. Computer databases are also used to store and analyze fingerprint data, blood and DNA samples, conviction records, mug shots, and other types of criminal data. Programming and integrating these sorts of databases for organizations such as the FBI and the National Crime Information Center can be a rewarding computer career. Education: Some experts estimate that at least 60 percent of jobs currently require computer skills; in reality, that number is probably closer to 80 percent, as the Internet and reliance on online communication grow. As a result, schools at all levels are increasing their use of computers in the classroom, creating great opportunities for those interested in a computer career that combines an interest in computers with education. There are approximately 82,000 elementary and secondary schools in the United States, and many more colleges and universities. These learning institutions need educators with computer skills. They also need quality software that can support students\u2019 use of computers for self-directed learning, research, and collaborative projects. Communications: Smoke signals, Morse code, the telephone \u2014 humans have always devised ways to communicate at a distance. Computers take this ability to new heights, enabling instant global communication. Companies use the Internet, local area networks (LANs), wireless LANs, wide area networks (WANs), video-conferencing applications, information security and cryptography programs, communication protocols, and new computer-driven communication devices such as smart phones to increase their ability to communicate securely with personnel and partners. Companies\u2019 desire to send data, messages, and even visual content to anywhere at any time provides a wide array of computer career opportunities. Media: The printed word is no longer the dominant media form. Instead, consumers and corporations are focusing more on digital media, including TV, movies, and social media on the Internet. Instead of mailing out brochures, for example, many companies now produce their own videos to publish on the Web. Blogs and social media Web sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter are proliferating. You can now watch TV on your computer and run computer video games on your TV. Special effects and advanced computer-assisted animation techniques have made movies more exciting and lifelike; animation is also often used to make Web sites more interesting. Even books are now being published in digital form as eBooks. In other words, computers are becoming the foundation upon which almost all media rests. Tags careers",

Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, May 31, 2011 A new study out of Georgetown University has named the top-earning bachelor's degrees and quantified their earning power, according to The Washington Post . Researchers at GU's Center on Education and the Workforce examined previously unreported census data to determine those who major in engineering, computer science or business will typically make 50% more over the course of their lifetime than those who major in the humanities, arts, education or psychology. The researchers found the median annual earning on an engineering degree is $75,000. Humanities degrees earn $47,000, arts degrees earn $44,000 and education/psychology degrees earn $42,000. To get more granular, a petroleum engineering degree will earn you $120,000; a pharmacy degree earns $105,000; and a math/computer science degree earns $98,000. On the other end of the scale, a counseling or psychology degree earns you $29,000 and an early childhood education degree earns $36,000. Still, a degree of any kind is extremely valuable when you consider the alternative of having just a high school diploma. On average, a college degree holder makes 84% more in a lifetime than someone who completes high school and then doesn't go on for further education. (There are always the exceptions, including those that drop out of college and become wealthy influencers, especially in the technology field. But overall, over time, having the degree matters.) Of course, it doesn't work to get a degree in something you don't enjoy just for the sake of money. A bigger paycheck to do something that leaves you feeling empty is no accomplishment at all in my book.

    "text_content": "As IBM marks its first century, Austin remains in a key role | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content As IBM marks its first century, Austin remains in a key role Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, June 15, 2011 IBM Corp. will celebrate its 100-year anniversary Thursday an unusually long tenure for a company in the ever-changing technology industry. Austin has been part of IBM's history for less that half of that time, but the city has become one of the company's most important research and development hubs. With about 6,000 employees, Austin is IBM's second-largest single site in the U.S., although it's still less than 2 percent of the company's 400,000 employees worldwide. And the Austin operations long have housed a significant portion of the company's brain trust, said Tony Befi , the company's senior state executive for Texas, who has overseen the Austin operations since 2001. Last year, IBM Corp. topped the list of U.S. patent winners for the 18th year in a row, with 5,896. IBM Austin inventors, with about 950 patent awards for the year, were tied for first place within Big Blue. \"I expect that to continue and I expect that to expand,\" Befi said. The Austin operations will share in the company's centennial observation Thursday with a town hall and reception at the company's North Austin offices, with Mayor Lee Leffingwell in attendance. When the Austin site opened in 1967, it was a manufacturing plant for IBM's Selectric typewriter. Today, Austin is home to considerable research and development work for IBM involving advanced microprocessor design, including the Power chips used in supercomputers, and a wide variety of systems software development. Notably, the site was deeply involved in building Watson, IBM's supercomputer that played \"Jeopardy!\" The Power7 processor, Watson's basic brain chip, was primarily designed in Austin, as was the Power 750 server. As the company moves forward, Befi said the Austin site will be at the forefront of new advances in technology. One of those is advanced analytics, or using technology to solve business and industry problems. Analytics will be increasingly applied in the health care field, but also in how cities operate more efficiently, from delivering water to managing electricity and traffic patterns, Befi said. \"You can just let your mind wander, and we're working in all these (areas),\" he said. The company is a major employer of University of Texas graduates and is a major sponsor of research in the computer science department, said Bruce Porter , chairman of the department. \"We've kind of grown together,\" he said. The company also has a number of partnerships with the university. Porter and other faculty members have open agreements with the company, which make it easier for an IBM office to sponsor a research project with a particular professor. Keshav Pingali , a UT computer science professor, said that IBM engineers also regularly attend department seminars and classes. \"The result of that is they help us keep our feet on the ground, so to speak,\" he said. UT and IBM are working closely as the computer science department prepares to move into a new $120 million complex in 2013. IBM and university faculty are studying how to make teaching more effective by incorporating technology, and the new building will be \"very influenced by these interactions with IBM,\" Pingali said. Porter called the relationship a \"strong positive feedback loop.\" \"The hand-in-hand growth of IBM and our department has led to the kind of high-tech economy that we have in Austin now,\" he said. \u201c As IBM marks its first century, Austin remains in a key role .\u201d | By Brian Gaar , AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF| Updated: 8:50 a.m. Wednesday, June 15, 2011 Published: 8:56 p.m. Tuesday, June 14, 2011 News Categories Industry Relations Tags Watson In the News IBM FoCS",

The team at the University of Texas and Yale University, including Professor Risto Miikkulainen and grad student Uli Grasemann, were looking to how the human brain is affected with schizophrenia by simulating a hypothesis that excessive dopamine in the brain can cause \u201cexaggerated salience\u201d, whereby the brain is learning from things it shouldn\u2019t. The ability to forget and ignore stuff is highly important for the functioning brain, and is the basis of a theory among neuroscientists known as the hyperlearning hypothesis. That leads an inability to extract meaningful information from the brain among so much information. The scientists believe that this can then lead to a brain making connections that are unreal, or makes it unable to put together a coherent story, which happens to be how most of our copy comes to light. To explore such effects further the team used a network called DISCERN, which is able to simulate the learning and understanding of language. The neural network computer system was taught a number of stories through the use of words and sentences rather than single units of information, training it with inputs thousands of times. The researchers than simulated the excessive release of dopamine by telling the DISCERN machine to stop forgetting so much information, promptly causing the machine to lose its marbles, finding that it produces some rather far-fetched stories. In fact the computer began owning up to crimes it didn't commit, putting itself at the centre of \u201cfantastical, delusional stories\u201d incorporating elements from other stories it had been told to recall, and in one answer the machine even claimed it was responsible for a terrorist bombing.

Steven W. Leslie, executive vice president and provost at The University of Texas at Austin, said the partnership brings together top educational researchers from the Mazur Group at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Department of Physics with educational innovators from The University of Texas at Austin. They will lead the implementation and dissemination of cutting-edge, evidence-based, interactive strategies of instruction that leverage educational technology to improve student learning and success. The primary vehicle for the collaboration will be the university's new Course Transformation Program , a state-of-the-art effort to advance pedagogical innovation, effective teaching and student success in general education courses. The Course Transformation Program already is transforming large, lower division gatekeeper courses at The University of Texas at Austin to improve student academic success and increase learning gains. The project eventually will reach more than 40,000 students in a five-year period. Dr. Gretchen Ritter, vice provost for undergraduate education and faculty governance at The University of Texas at Austin, is director of the program, which is being developed and implemented by the university's Center for Teaching and Learning under the leadership of Dr. Harrison Keller, vice provost for higher education policy and executive director of the Center for Teaching and Learning. Ritter said the initiative is a key part of a campaign by the university's president, William Powers Jr., to make The University of Texas at Austin a leader in reinventing higher education for the 21st century. \"Universities around the country are increasingly aware that the Internet has significantly changed the way our students learn,\" Ritter said. She said advising for the project is provided by two faculty led panels \u2014 the Research and Assessment Advisory Panel, co-chaired by Dr. Chandra Muller, a professor of sociology, and Dr. Paul Resta, the Ruth Knight Millikan Centennial Professor in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, and the Educational Technology and Learning Analytics Advisory Panel, chaired by Dr. Bruce Porter, chair of the Department of Computer Science. Leslie said innovative, technology-enhanced approaches to teaching and learning \"will help us better connect to all of our students, better support their academic and professional development and better prepare them for tomorrow's workplace.\" \"The Course Transformation Project's integration of educational technology and scientific approaches to ensuring student academic success unique to this partnership will place The University of Texas at Austin and Harvard at the forefront of undergraduate education reform,\" said Dr. Julie Schell, postdoctoral fellow from Harvard and lead collaborator. Schell is the senior educational researcher in the Mazur Group at Harvard. Dr. Eric Mazur, the Balkanski Professor of Physics and Applied Physics and area dean of applied physics at Harvard, heads one of the largest physics research groups at Harvard and is an internationally renowned laser physicist. Mazur also is the developer of Peer Instruction, an innovative, evidence-based teaching and learning method used in thousands of classrooms throughout the world. \"I'm excited to be part of a faculty-led push to innovate in lower-division courses across the campus at The University of Texas at Austin,\" Mazur said. The Mazur Group develops and researches technology-based learning methods that drive student success by transforming conventionally taught courses.

    "text_content": "Scientists Afflict Computers with Schizophrenia to Better Understand the Human Brain | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Scientists Afflict Computers with Schizophrenia to Better Understand the Human Brain Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, May 5, 2011 AUSTIN, Texas\u2014Computer networks that can\u2019t forget fast enough can show symptoms of a kind of virtual schizophrenia, giving researchers further clues to the inner workings of schizophrenic brains, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin and Yale University have found. The researchers used a virtual computer model, or \u201cneural network,\u201d to simulate the excessive release of dopamine in the brain. They found that the network recalled memories in a distinctly schizophrenic-like fashion. Their results were published in April in Biological Psychiatry . \u201cThe hypothesis is that dopamine encodes the importance-the salience-of experience,\u201d says Uli Grasemann , a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cWhen there\u2019s too much dopamine, it leads to exaggerated salience, and the brain ends up learning from things that it shouldn\u2019t be learning from.\u201d The results bolster a hypothesis known in schizophrenia circles as the hyperlearning hypothesis, which posits that people suffering from schizophrenia have brains that lose the ability to forget or ignore as much as they normally would. Without forgetting, they lose the ability to extract what\u2019s meaningful out of the immensity of stimuli the brain encounters. They start making connections that aren\u2019t real, or drowning in a sea of so many connections they lose the ability to stitch together any kind of coherent story. The neural network used by Grasemann and his adviser, Professor Risto Miikkulainen , is called DISCERN. Designed by Miikkulainen to learn natural language, it was used in this study to simulate what happens to language as the result of eight different types of neurological dysfunction. The results of the simulations were compared by Ralph Hoffman, professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, to what he saw when studying human schizophrenics. In order to model the process, Grasemann and Miikkulainen began by teaching a series of simple stories to DISCERN. The stories were assimilated into DISCERN\u2019s memory in much the way the human brain stores information-not as distinct units, but as statistical relationships of words, sentences, scripts and stories. \u201cWith neural networks, you basically train them by showing them examples, over and over and over again,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cEvery time you show it an example, you say, if this is the input, then this should be your output, and if this is the input, then that should be your output. You do it again and again thousands of times, and every time it adjusts a little bit more towards doing what you want. In the end, if you do it enough, the network has learned.\u201d In order to model hyperlearning, Grasemann and Miikkulainen ran the system through its paces again , but with one key parameter altered. They simulated an excessive release of dopamine by increasing the system\u2019s learning rate\u2014essentially telling it to stop forgetting so much. \u201cIt\u2019s an important mechanism to be able to ignore things,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cWhat we found is that if you crank up the learning rate in DISCERN high enough, it produces language abnormalities that suggest schizophrenia.\u201d After being re-trained with the elevated learning rate, DISCERN began putting itself at the center of fantastical, delusional stories that incorporated elements from other stories it had been told to recall. In one answer, for instance, DISCERN claimed responsibility for a terrorist bombing. In another instance, DISCERN began showing evidence of \u201cderailment\u201d\u2014replying to requests for a specific memory with a jumble of dissociated sentences, abrupt digressions and constant leaps from the first- to the third-person and back again. \u201cInformation processing in neural networks tends to be like information processing in the human brain in many ways,\u201d says Grasemann. \u201cSo the hope was that it would also break down in similar ways. And it did.\u201d The parallel between their modified neural network and human schizophrenia isn\u2019t absolute proof the hyperlearning hypothesis is correct, says Grasemann. It is, however, support for the hypothesis, and also evidence of how useful neural networks can be in understanding the human brain. \u201cWe have so much more control over neural networks than we could ever have over human subjects,\u201d he says. \u201cThe hope is that this kind of modeling will help clinical research.\u201d For more information contact: Daniel Oppenheimer, oppenheimer@mail.utexas.edu , (512) 232-0682; Uli Grasemann, uli@cs.utexas.edu , 512-203-3501.

    "text_content": "Passing the Baton, Increasing Student Exposure to the Entrepreneurial World | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Passing the Baton, Increasing Student Exposure to the Entrepreneurial World Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, May 3, 2011 The Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin (UTCS) has embarked on an initiative to bring increased exposure of the entrepreneurial world to our students. Austin, Texas is renowned for its interest in and support of entrepreneurial endeavors, and has become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity in recent years. This is largely attributable to the prevalent \"creative class\" in Austin\u2014nurtured by the Austin environment and the influence of talent, ideas and resources flowing from The University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin). In May 2010, Kiplinger's named Austin the top city for business for the next decade. Demographers call Austin a \"City of Ideas,\"\u2014one of a handful of American regions where a new creative class of entrepreneurs, business leaders, artists and visionaries are reshaping the model for American prosperity. Since so many entrepreneurial ideas and start-up companies are technology based, it makes good sense for UTCS, a top-ten ranked computer science department, to support and encourage this entrepreneurial ecosystem in Austin. The UTCS entrepreneurial initiative is launching with several initial steps to provide our students the opportunity to experience entrepreneurship first-hand and to learn from successful entrepreneurs by guiding students from a variety of disciplines through the early stages of the startup experience. Students work on a real start-up company, including learning from mentors and speakers, brainstorming ideas, conducting market validation, devising business models, building prototypes, creating branding, and pitching to investors and successful entrepreneurs. Toward this goal, UTCS is one of the supporters of 3 Day Start-up (3DS) , an ongoing student entrepreneurship program that takes place over three days. And in a new initiative inspired by 3DS, UTCS along with the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the McCombs School of Business will introduce \u201cOne Semester Start-up\u201d, a semester-long program of startup acceleration starting fall 2011. The new course will be co-taught by Joshua Baer (Entrepreneur and Director of Capital Factory), Bob Metcalfe (Director of Innovation, Cockrell School of Engineering at UT) and John Butler (Associate Director and Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Finance, Red McCombs School of Business).

    "text_content": "Research Corner: Gates Building Prediction Market | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Research Corner: Gates Building Prediction Market Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, January 25, 2012 Prediction markets are popular for aggregating opinions regarding the likelihood of future events by enabling people to buy and sell \"shares\" that indicate whether or not they think the event will happen. There has been some evidence that the market prices are reasonably accurate predictors of whether those events will actually happen. For example, the popular prediction market site intrade.com has markets for sports events, such as who Albert Pujols will play for in 2012; scientific events, such as whether the Higgs Boson Particle will be observed before the end of 2012; and political events, such as who will be the Republican presidential nominee. On August 31st, you could have bought a $10 share of \"Rick Perry will be the Republican presidential nominee\" for a little less than $4. This price indicated that the market believed that there was roughly a 40% chance of the event happening. As of this writing, the price is a little less than a $1. So, had you bought the share in August, you could now sell it back, and take a $3 loss. If the event happens, people holding shares earn $10 per share, while if it does not they earn nothing. Short selling is allowed, so you can bet against events as well as for. If that makes sense to you, you're ready to play! If you're confused, the intrade.com \"How it Works\" tab fills in all the details. From September 2008 to August 2009, Abe Othman, a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), ran a prediction market to forecast when CMU's two new computer science buildings would open. This market was, by one measure, the largest prediction market ever run. And it did manage to zero in on the correct date as the opening date approached. In partnership with Yahoo! Research through their Faculty Research Engagement Program (FREP), and specific collaboration with David Pennock, we are pleased to announce with this article, a new prediction market on the opening date of the UTCS Gates Building, which builds upon the success of the CMU experiment. Professor Peter Stone and Post-doc Tsz-Chiu Au invite you to add your predictions to the mix, perhaps after assessing the progress through the live webcams available on the department's website. Successful bidders will earn raffle tickets for a prize drawing after the building opens.

Pending approval by the Board of Regents, this funding will enable the department to finish-out all the floors of both buildings and to start moving in by March 2013. UT\u2019s faculty and students will work and learn in modern, interactive spaces in the Gates Complex including \u201cresearch clusters,\u201d areas on each floor designed to encourage discussion and collaboration. Located on the footprint of Taylor Hall in the heart of campus, the complex will almost double the department\u2019s capacity for students and faculty. UTCS, the nation\u2019s largest and most diverse top-10 computer science program, currently produces about 20% of the computer science graduates in Texas. The department graduates close to 200 computer scientists annually, more than any other top-10 computer science department in the U.S. The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that computer science is the fastest-growing job market for science and engineering degree holders. The demand for its graduates across all sectors of the economy significantly outstrips supply. Consequently, competition for the leading visionaries in computer science is fierce. Modern research and instructional space gives the department a distinct advantage in recruiting and retaining top talent. By boosting department capacity, the Gates Complex will help the department boost the Texas economy and advance computing research and education to new heights.

The CAREER awards recognize promising young faculty and supports their research with five years of funding. Mikhail \u201cMisha\u201d Matz, an assistant professor in the Section of Integrative Biology, will be the first to address genetics of coral adaptation in nature with his $674,000 in funding, which will clarify some of the most fundamental mechanisms of evolution in the oceans. The project is to establish genetic markers to assess the risk of extinction of individual reefs, which will help prioritize conservation efforts. Michael Walfish, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, will investigate ways of outsourcing computation without having to trust or assume that the entities providing computing resources are actually working correctly with his $450,000 in funding. This could make cloud computing safer, spurring the adoption of cloud services, causing more people to pay less for computing. Other CAREER award recipients from the university are: Amit Bhasin, Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering. The $400,000 project is to conduct research and provide the fundamental knowledge to chemically modify asphalt binders that will yield superior self-healing and mechanical properties. Constantine Caramanis, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The $400,000 project is to develop a new methodological framework to understand high dimensional complex phenomena from potentially corrupted and incomplete data. This research has the potential to significantly affect abilities to discover important structure in complex problems, from bioinformatics to social networks. Christopher Ellison, Department of Chemical Engineering. The $500,000 project is to provide better understanding of polymer physics to improve advanced materials design. The research could lead to improvements in hard drive lubricants, to make data storage more reliable, and microelectronics manufacturing, to manufacture smaller, more efficient electronic components. Jung-Fu Lin, Department of Geological Sciences. The $538,000 project investigates the alloying effects of major candidate light elements on the phase diagram and elasticity of iron under relevant pressures and temperatures of the Earth\u2019s core in order to address pressing issues of its composition, thermal structures and seismic features.

While the job outlook for electrical and computer engineers was not dire last year, the uptick in the economy brings even happier tidings for the class of 2011. Everyone\u2014from Microsoft and Google to small start-ups\u2014seems to be looking for talented programmers and developers. Grads with software skills have particularly bright prospects. We can credit the proliferation of social media and new devices, says Forrest Shull, a senior scientist at the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering , one of several U.S. arms of the giant German research organization. \"Over the last two years or so, cloud computing and mobile applications are the two paradigms that have increased demand for software engineers,\" says Shull. \"We really like walking around everywhere now with our smartphones, tablets, and other gadgets.\" A December 2010 report by the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that cloud computing could add 2.4 million jobs in Europe's biggest economies by 2015. As another hopeful sign, recruiters are back on campus this year. Scott Midkiff, head of the electrical and computer engineering department at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, says they \"are reappearing with significant hiring goals,\" particularly in the areas of defense, energy, consulting, banking and finance, and computing. Notable as well is the increased presence of information and communications technology companies, which had drastically reduced their hiring after the telecom and dot-com busts. Beverly Principal, assistant director of employment services at Stanford, is seeing the same thing. \"On-campus recruiting was higher this year, especially for students focused in computer science, hardware, software, and programming,\" she says. The National Association of Colleges and Employers , in Bethlehem, Pa., expects hiring of new grads to be up 19 percent. Computer science, electrical engineering, and computer engineering are among the top 10 degrees on employers' most-wanted lists. Those three degrees are also in the top five of the association's list of the 10 top-paid degrees\u2014a list that consists entirely of technology majors. Of the three, computer science grads are making the most\u2014slightly more than US $63 000 on average. While overall offers to engineering grads have stayed roughly the same as last year, EEs saw the biggest jump (4.4 percent) to reach $61 690. Software engineering, a field that has been strong for a while, was voted the best job for 2011 by career guidance website CareerCast . Software engineers earned the most after chemical engineers in 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are also some of the most employed\u2014their unemployment rate was 4.6 percent compared with 5.4 for EEs in 2010. Four social networking companies\u2014Facebook, Google, Twitter, and online gaming company Zynga \u2014are expected to create around 10 000 jobs, a good portion of which will be for software engineers. However, talented engineers of all stripes are wanted, says Facebook representative Slater Tow. \"We're primarily looking for what people have done, what they've built. This is more important to us than just academic credentials.\" Tech bigwigs such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and Microsoft are also hiring, as are smaller companies, including Agilent, Altera, Analog Devices, and Applied Materials. Many new jobs are overseas, even as powerhouse manufacturers Nokia and Panasonic cut thousands of jobs. Google is planning to make more than 1000 new hires in Europe, at least half of which will require engineering and computer science credentials, and the company is posting hundreds of jobs across the Asia-Pacific region. Siemens and Microsoft are recruiting in Europe, while Microsoft is hiring in the Asia-Pacific (mainly China, India, Malaysia, and Singapore), looking particularly for cloud technology skills. Software and IT jobs remain plentiful in India and China. In the United States, entrepreneurship has been on an upswing since the current recession began. Kerri Boivin, director of the engineering career resource center at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, says, \"We are seeing more students becoming entrepreneurs [and] have seen a significant increase in start-ups posting jobs.\" This article originally appeared in print as \"Where the Jobs Are: Software Engineering\".

The Statistics and Scientific Computation Lab is a collaboration between the Division of Statistics and Scientific Computation (SCC) in the College of Natural Sciences and the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Both divisions recognized the need for a space on the main campus where instructors could teach topics with lecture and lab components integrated into an innovative teaching environment. \u201cThe new lab embodies the increasing importance that statistics and scientific computation play in our lives,\u201d said Sheldon Ekland-Olson, director of the SSC. \u201cThis innovative facility is a marvelous testimony to interdisciplinary cooperation across campus and is a moment to celebrate. The University of Texas at Austin is once again providing students with access to cutting-edge educational resources.\u201d The lab is outfitted with 32 Dell workstations with the latest processors and video capabilities. There are plans to use the space as a distance learning classroom for all 15 institutions that compose the University of Texas System. \u201cThe new lab enables the tremendous expertise of UT Austin faculty, and researchers at TACC, SSC and other departments, to benefit UT Austin students across colleges, and eventually to share this expertise with students at other institutions in real time,\u201d said TACC Director Jay Boisseau. \u201cThe capabilities and flexibility of this lab enable us to teach in the most effective mixed modes of lecture and practice for a wide variety of topics in scientific computing.\u201d The lab puts the right tools in the hands of students and readies them for graduate-level research. Students are using Linux, a leading computer operating system that runs the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, on the workstations in the lab. These workstations interact with a TACC supercomputer, providing students with practical experience in advanced computing technologies. \u201cEvery student has a laptop or desktop, but they don\u2019t have a high-performance computing (HPC) environment, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re emulating on these workstations,\u201d said John Lockman, research associate at TACC. \u201cGetting students to use the tools we use every day in HPC is a great step forward.\u201d For more information, contact: Lee Clippard , College of Natural Sciences, 512-232-0675; Faith Singer , Texas Advanced Computing Center, 512-232-5771.

    "text_content": "Researchers at U. of Texas and Yale Use Computers to Simulate Schizophrenia | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Researchers at U. of Texas and Yale Use Computers to Simulate Schizophrenia Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, May 9, 2011 From: The Chronicle of Higher Education | Researchers at U. of Texas and Yale Use Computers to Simulate Schizophrenia Computer simulations of malfunctioning brains may be the key to understanding schizophrenia and other conditions. A research team including computer scientists at the University of Texas at Austin and a professor of psychiatry at Yale have been testing various theories of how schizophrenic brains misfire as they process information. People with schizophrenia often have trouble repeating different stories, for instance, frequently combining elements of separate stories and inserting themselves into the narrative. \u201cWe are trying to quantify being delusional,\u201d says Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science and neuroscience at Texas, who designed the computer network on which the hypotheses were tested. The results of their work will be published in the May 15 edition of Biological Psychology . The team\u2019s simulation suggested that the problem might be a phenomenon called \u201chyperlearning\u201d\u2014meaning that people with schizophrenia focus too much attention on recent pieces of information and fail to successfully integrate this information with prior learning. This results in an inability to properly identify what information is most important. \u201cHyperlearning means that memory consolidation is abnormal,\u201d says Mr. Miikkulainen. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t form a coherent structure of the world.\u201d For the computer network, learning how to build words into sentences, subplots, and stories is a gradual process that researchers develop by feeding the network example after example. This process teaches the computer what information is most important and how to construct stories out of these building blocks. The networks following the hyperlearning model were trained normally until the very end, when the \u201crate\u201d of learning was increased, which threw off the balance of the earlier training. When given new stories to build and repeat, the hyperlearning networks recalled fewer of the stories than other networks, often mashed together elements of different stories, substituted the wrong words, and frequently inserted the wrong characters into stories. Inserting the wrong characters in stories explains why people with schizophrenia sometimes perceive themselves to be persecuted or have delusions of grandeur\u2014they insert themselves into other people\u2019s stories. Mr. Miikkulainen says the team, which included Uli Grasemann, a Texas graduate student, and Ralph E. Hoffman, a professor of psychiatry at Yale\u2019s medical school, wasn\u2019t expecting the model to identify hyperlearning as the most plausible hypothesis and, rather, anticipated that schizophrenia was more likely caused by an excessive \u201cpruning,\u201d or destruction, of neural networks as people age. He says the next step is to test the findings of the model more on human patients using brain scans and interviews, but he also hopes to use his program to study other mental illnesses\u2014such as depression and bipolar disorder\u2014and to use the model to test various treatments for schizophrenia and these other illnesses.

    "text_content": "Three Cheers for Watson | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Three Cheers for Watson Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, February 14, 2011 Count computer scientists Bruce Porter, Ray Mooney and Ken Barker among those cheering for the machine in the Jeopardy! Challenge, which pits two human Jeopardy! champions against Watson, a computer built by IBM Corp. Watson will take on Ken Jennings, who had the show\u2019s longest winning streak, and Brad Rutter, it\u2019s all-time money winner, in games that will broadcast Feb. 14, 15 and 16. IBM dreamed up the Jeopardy! contest to demonstrate the capabilities of computers to do things people do. In a previous human vs. computer match, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Actually, Porter, Mooney and Barker, members of the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin, are cheering more for the people behind Watson than they are for the computer. \u201cI\u2019m not rooting for this program, which is just a piece of software,\u201d said Mooney, a professor in the Department of Computer Science. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for the team at IBM that put this together. They put their heart into this.\u201d IBM counts Porter, Mooney and Barker as members of that team. Although they don\u2019t know whether Watson runs a line of their computer code, IBM credited them and researchers at seven other universities with making contributions to the computer. The three computer scientists work on getting computers to develop common sense knowledge and understand and process human language. Porter, chairman of the department, and Mooney have worked in artificial intelligence for more than 20 years, most of them at the university. Barker, a research scientist, has been at the university for 11 years. Mooney\u2019s line is that the three biggest challenges to a computer being able to build knowledge from data are, \u201cAmbiguity, ambiguity, ambiguity.\u201d Examples: When is a bat a Louisville slugger and when is it a flying mammal? When Annie Leibovitz shoots someone will the result be a photo in Vanity Fair or a jail sentence? People understand the differences because we\u2019ve built a bank of knowledge and experience since birth. Computer scientists have to program that kind of common sense context into computers. Computer scientists have been doing it for decades. They\u2019re making progress and Watson is part of that progress. Watson has about 10 million documents \u2014 including Wikipedia, the Internet Movie Data Base, the New York Times archive \u2014 stored in its memory. Its task is to know what to look for, where to look for it and know how to put that data together into an accurate answer. Jeopardy! is a tricky challenge for a computer. Players are given clues, which take advantage of the ambiguity in human language with puns and word play. It can take human contestants a couple of tries to home in on just what kind of answer the game is seeking. Not only that, but answers to the clues must be given in the form of a question. Porter, Mooney and Barker are excited about the Watson project and have had fun watching it unfold. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for a couple of reasons,\u201d Barker said, \u201cOne because we were skeptical that it could be done. Second, it\u2019s an entertaining task. It\u2019s fun for us.\u201d Mooney said it\u2019s good for science to have events like the challenge that capture the public imagination. \u201cThe folks at IBM had good intuition about this,\u201d he said. They said that what is learned in building Watson can be applied to areas such as where the information in a field such as medicine, finance and military intelligence overwhelms the human capability to keep up. \u201cWatson would allow a doctor the ability to ask pointed questions about a body of literature without the doctor have to read it all,\u201d Porter said.

Teams from all over the state traveled to compete in the open format contest. In addition to local Austin area schools, there were entries from Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Waller, Weslaco, Ozona and Palacios. Students began the day with a presentation by Professor Calvin Lin. His presentation explored the dramatic changes computer science has enabled and encouraged students to continue their studies in computer science when they moved on to college. The computer science competition itself consisted of an individual written test in the morning and a team-programming contest in the afternoon. Teams of three students tackled twelve programming problems, trying to solve as many of them as possible in the two-hour time limit. UTCS students served as judges and volunteers. Mark Fulbright of Richardson High School and Andrew Liu of Cypress Woods High School tied for first place on the written exam in the large school division. Each student missed only one of 40 questions over Java programming, algorithms and data structures. The small school winner was Jacob Kovar of Needville High School. The team of Matthew Dierker, Andrew Lin, Chirag Sakhuja of William P. Clements High School achieved the highest programming score during the afternoon competition. The team solved 11 of the 12 programming problems. Team members combined written scores and their programming score to determine overall results. In the large school division (high school classifications of 4A and 5A), the team of Matt Reid, Jose Vera and Grant Zheng from Seven Lakes High school took first place honors with a score of 1,285 out of possible 1,440. The team is coached by Paul Stroud, the computer science teacher at Seven Lakes High School. The small school division (high school classifications of 1A, 2A, and 3A) was led by the team of Clarissa Burciaga, Mason Egger and Jacob Kovar of Needville High School. They are coached by Delta McFarland, the computer science teacher at Needville. UIL sponsors and coordinates high school academic competitions in 22 areas including computer science. High school students compete in a series of open and invitational contests in the fall and winter, and then attempt to qualify for the state competition via district and regional contests.

They\u2019ve developed a new social media website called Webcam Window. \"We've created a content filtered version of almost any kind of random chat site that are online right now as well as we've tied in a profile system,\" Weiser explained.As far back as he can remember, he said he's been interested in technology. \u201cI was a kid who always liked to play with wires instead of action figures,\" Weiser said. Luckily, what he and Smith love to do has given them skills companies are after. Bruce Porter, the Computer Science chair at the University of Texas said on a national level the statistics are telling.\"Right now American universities are producing about half of the graduates that industry demands,\" Porter said.The demand for jobs is high in the technical sector and in positions that deal with computer science, like web and software developers.\"We produce about 20 percent of all the computer scientists trained in Texas,\" Porter explained. However, Porter said he knows it's not enough.\"The state does not produce as many computer programmers as is demanded by industry so local companies are recruiting out of state,\" he said.Still, Austin is an attractive home for tech companies. Porter said the schools have programs to train the proper workforce.\"Facebook has moved to Austin recently. They will probably grow their presence here. So for students that are interested in computer gaming, the social aspects of computer science, this is a very exciting time to get involved,\" Porter said.Weiser said the opportunity has put him at the right place at the right time.The UT computer science department is expanding by 50 percent. A brand new building is under construction to make room on campus. It's scheduled to be completed by 2012. Tags careers In the News",

Filmed by the Longhorn Network, the event had three components: a comprehensive interview in which Dell described how he got to where he is now, a question and answer session that allowed students to get advice from the wildly successful entrepreneur and time for networking and connecting with current and future entrepreneurs. Responding to questions from Dr. Melcalfe, Dell started the evening by delving into his past, talking about growing up as the son of an orthodontist father and a financial consultant mother, a combination that led to much conversation about money and science in his household. In 1983, Dell enrolled in UT as a pre-med major, following familial expectations that he would become a doctor. Dell had different plans, however. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to try to have a perfect plan. You learn when you are failing, not when you are succeeding. You want to make a lot of mistakes and correct them.\u201d \u2014 Michael Dell Thrilled by the new information processing technology that had just begin to take off, Dell started a business from within his Dobie dorm room by creating hard disk drive and memory upgrade packages for the limited computers available at the time. Dell\u2019s upgrades became popular, his business boomed, and by the end of his freshman year he had realized it was time to drop out of college, buy an office, and follow his dreams. By 1986, just three years after he had begun creating upgrade packages in Dobie, he had earned between $60 and $70 million in revenue, creating what would become some of the most powerful and popular computer systems in the world. Dell talked a lot about the importance of startup companies like his, but he also warned that it is not something that can happen for everyone. He explained that it requires a unique crossroad of ideas, timing and the market that he happened to hit the jackpot for. Still, he was optimistic and encouraging about the future of startup businesses, especially in a community like UT. \u201cWe have this real belief that entrepreneurs and startups are essential to the American economy,\u201d Dell said. \u201cPromoting entrepreneurship is incredibly important.\u201d In the question and answer portion of the presentation, students prodded Dell for advice about everything from dealing with parents who don\u2019t understand a dream to deciding which dreams are worth pursuing to figuring out what exactly the right formula is for starting a successful business. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to try to have a perfect plan,\u201d Dell answered one question. \u201cYou learn when you are failing, not when you are succeeding. You want to make a lot of mistakes and correct them. Students in attendance of the event came away with a great understanding of what it takes to be an entrepreneur and to have success in the startup market. \u201cEntrepreneurs need to go out and try,\u201d electrical engineering major Kyle Xial said. \u201cThere are a thousand ways to fail but only one way to succeed. You have to find that one way.\u201d Tags entrepreneurship",

    "text_content": "Alan Cline Steps Down as Director of the Dean\u2019s Scholars Honors Program | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Alan Cline Steps Down as Director of the Dean\u2019s Scholars Honors Program Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, May 9, 2011 AUSTIN, Texas\u2014After 20 years as director of the Dean\u2019s Scholars Honors program in the College of Natural Sciences, computer scientist Alan Cline is stepping down. At the end of the semester he\u2019ll be handing over the reins of the program to biologist David Hillis , the Alfred W. Roark Centennial Professor in Natural Sciences. Cline, the David Bruton, Jr. Centennial Professor in Computer Sciences, was the third director of the program when he took over in 1991. Under Cline\u2019s stewardship the program has doubled in size, evolved to grant honors degrees in all of the majors in the College of Natural Sciences, and become so competitive that last year 67 high school valedictorians were among those rejected for admission to the first-year class. It\u2019s also the model for the new Health Science Honors program, which was launched in the fall of 2010. \u201cWhen Dean\u2019s Scholars started in 1983 it was a very different thing,\u201d says Cline . \u201cIt was more about creating a space for students who had a special interest in research to take some seminars together and get together once a week or so. Nobody had the idea that it would become what it is now, with honors degrees, so many special classes, and such an intensive focus on research.\u201d The Dean\u2019s Scholars Honors Program is a 4-year degree program that enrolls roughly 50 students per class. Over the past 28 years Dean\u2019s Scholars have won some of the most prestigious and competitive graduate fellowships in the nation, including Marshall Scholarships, Gates Foundation Scholarships, National Science Foundation Fellowships and a Rhodes Scholarship. What makes Dean\u2019s Scholars unique, says Cline, isn\u2019t just its academic rigor but how the academics are amplified by a rich social experience. Students take classes together, attend special dinners hosted by faculty members, participate in lunchtime discussions, take weekend field trips to places like the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas, and have evolved a body of lore and tradition that binds together Dean\u2019s Scholars past, present and future. \u201cThere\u2019s a spirit to the program\u201d says Cline, \u201ca feeling of belonging, of being with folks who have similar talents and similar interests. What we\u2019ve tried to do is create a small community of like-minded, very talented science students amidst a very large university.\u201d Cline\u2019s role in fostering this sense of community was honored at the Dean\u2019s Scholars alumni reunion this spring with the establishment of the Dean\u2019s Scholars Endowment. More than 75 alumni contributed to the $26,000 endowment, which will award scholarships every year in Cline\u2019s name. Alumni also honored Cline with their words, with many of them taking to the stage to recount memories of how he\u2019d changed their lives for the better. It was, says Cline, one of the more meaningful moments in a career as director that has been rewarding beyond what he\u2019d ever expected. \u201cThese students are achieving so many wonderful things,\u201d he says. \u201cSuppose I have just one tenth of the joy in their achievements that they do, just one tenth of it. Now multiply that times one thousand of them, and it makes for an extremely satisfying life. And that\u2019s not going to stop. I\u2019m stepping down as director, but I\u2019ll still be around. I\u2019ll still be teaching. And my door will still be open.\u201d Tags News Releases Main Page Honors &amp; Awards Computer Science College & Campus",

    "text_content": "Better Animation Through Body Part Recycling | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Better Animation Through Body Part Recycling Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, December 21, 2010 The user is presented with a ribbon of choices for the torso, which are colored according to their distance from the target mesh. For all the power that computers have brought to the process of animation, it remains the human eye that\u2019s the best judge of whether animated things moving in space look real. \u201cPeople intuitively know exactly what to draw to evoke realism,\u201d says Don Fussell , professor of computer science. \u201cComputers don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d What computers can do, however, is systematize the labor, liberating humans to focus their talents and energies where it\u2019s needed most. That\u2019s what Fussell and his doctoral student Christian Miller are doing with their new system Frankenrigs . Using data from characters that have already been meticulously, laboriously animated by humans, Frankenrigs assembles a virtual warehouse of body parts. For each arm, leg, and torso in the warehouse there are precise measurements of how long the bones are, where the joints are, and where and how the artist attached the character\u2019s outer skin (its \u201cmesh\u201d) to its inner skeleton (its \u201crig\u201d). These last numbers, which are known as \u201cskin weights,\u201d are the most important in determining the way a character walks, run, jumps, falls, waves, punches and dances. \u201cEach bit of the mesh has a skin weight value saying which bone it\u2019s atttached to,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt\u2019s not one or zero, but a range. If it\u2019s entirely attached to one bone, for instance, it moves rigidly with the bone. If it\u2019s near a joint, and, say, 30 percent attached to one bone and 70 percent to the other, then when you move the skeleton it blends the motions.\u201d When an artist is beginning the process of animating a new character, which has a skin but no skeleton and no instructions for how the skin is attached to the skeleton, Frankenrigs automatically rummages through its database for old parts that are similar in shape to the new parts. Then, like a virtual Dr. Frankenstein, it stitches together a new body made up of the old parts, \u201cskinning\u201d it with a skin weight map composed of the skin weights of the old parts. http://youtu.be/8PdQ-upwCCk At a number of points in the process, the artist can step in to manually fine tune the character if the software makes a choice that doesn\u2019t look right. If the software suggests an arm from its warehouse that looks too bulky, or that has an elbow at the wrong point along it, then the artist can cycle through the other arms in the warehouse for a better match. Or he can move the elbow joint a few jots to the left or right. If the skin weight map for a given joint doesn\u2019t produce natural-looking deformations, then the artist can make use of a tool that Fussell and Miller call \u201cthe magic cylinder.\u201d The user runs the cylinder over the problematic area, and more processing power is devoted to predicting the right skin weights. When Frankenrigs has done everything it can to rig and skin a character so that it moves realistically, the artist can seamlessly plug the character back into Maya , which is the 3-D animation software that most industry animators us. Then one can do a final polish in Maya. The result, in the tests that Fussell and Miller have run, is an extraordinary amount of time saved. What in the past might have taken artists weeks now takes hours. Fussell and Miller aren\u2019t the first to automate the task of skinning characters. In Maya, for instance, there\u2019s already a tool that automatically rigs and skins meshes. But the automation is based purely on mathematical deductions, and the deformations it produces are very crude. As a consequence, animators are forced to spend a lot of time correcting the mistakes that the automation has made. \u201cThe program in Maya will take a guess,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt can usually can get it right in the middle of arms or the middle of bones, but when it gets around joints it starts making big mistakes. Then the artist has to painstakingly modify the skin weights on each region of the mesh by using what\u2019s called a skin weight brush, which looks like an actual paint brush. It\u2019s all trial and error. They\u2019ll paint a bit, flex the joint to see if it flexes the way they want it to. If it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019ll paint a little bit more. Flex it again. And so on and so on. It\u2019s very tedious and time-consuming, and it\u2019s not unusual for pros to spend weeks or even months getting the skinning right on a single character.\u201d With Frankenrigs, the automated rigging and skinning is so superior that even a novice animator can produce a near-professional quality animation in a short time. For a professional animator, although there will inevitably be some work with the skin-weight brush at the end of the process, it will be dramatically less work. One of the more striking aspects of the success of Frankenrigs is that it\u2019s been able to achieve such gains in efficiency and accuracy with a warehouse of parts that was salvaged from only 13 fully realized characters (which they got online from existing databases, or paid artists and students to create). If Frankenrigs is adopted by film and gaming studios, as Fussell and Miller hope it will be, the results should be even better. Such companies have massive collections of aliens, animals, monsters, soldiers and civilians they\u2019ve already animated to move in exactly the way they want, and so their body parts warehouses should have limbs for nearly every occasion. At the moment, Fussell and Miller are in talks with some Austin-based gaming companies about doing trial runs with the program. Even more promisingly, for the future of Frankenrigs, is the fact that the country\u2019s premiere video game development master\u2019s program, The Guildhall at SMU , has agreed to incorporate Frankenrigs into its toolbox. If the Guildhall students end up liking Frankenrigs, points out Fussell, they\u2019ll want to keep using it when they graduate, and that means that they\u2019ll bring it with them to places like Pixar, Dreamworks, ILM and the big gaming companies. Closer to home, Fussell hopes that efforts like Frankenrigs will contribute to the eventual development of an undergraduate video gaming program at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cFor a long time, the advances in video gaming were coming almost entirely from industry,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s changing. A lot more is coming from academic computer science research, and. there are already centers of excellence for this. We\u2019re a little bit behind, but I don\u2019t think the opportunity has passed us by.\u201d News Categories Research Tags Computer Science",

The work will join Landmarks\u2019 permanent collection of public art on the main campus. \u201cLeWitt\u2019s structure will serve not only as an object in its own right but also as a new place that will allow students to interact with the Computer Science environment in a way that is informal and was nonexistent before,\u201d said Andrew Houston, a member of the Faculty Building Advisory Committee and architecture and urban studies undergraduate. \u201cIt will be a focal point of intellectual debate and exploration\u2014both of its embodied ideas and its physical presence.\u201d The structure is made of concrete blocks that form a 25-foot-diameter ring, which is intersected by 14-foot-high towers at equal intervals. It represents the modular structures and simple, geometric forms for which LeWitt is acclaimed. He pioneered the development of Minimalism and Conceptual art in the 1960s and 1970s. His ideas value concept over expression, and the execution of his work invites artistic collaboration.

    "text_content": "Securing the Cloud | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Securing the Cloud Posted by Staff Writer on Tuesday, January 18, 2011 The future of the Internet could look like this: The bulk of the world\u2019s computing is outsourced to \u201c the cloud \u201d\u2015to massive data centers that house tens or even hundreds of thousands of computers. Rather than doing most of the heavy lifting themselves, our PCs, laptops, tablets and smart phones act like terminals, remotely accessing data centers through the Internet while conserving their processing juice for tasks like rendering HD video and generating concert-quality sound. What needs to be figured out for this cloud-based future to emerge are three big things. One is how the computers within these data centers should talk to each other. Another is how the data centers should talk to each other within a super-secure cloud core. The third is how the cloud should talk to everyone else, including the big Internet service providers, the local ISPs and the end-of-the-line users (i.e. us). This last channel, in particular, interests Michael Walfish, an assistant professor of computer science and one of the principal investigators of the NEBULA Project , which was awarded $7.5 million by the National Science Foundation to develop an architecture for making the Internet more cloud-friendly. If we\u2019re going to be trusting so much of our computing lives to the cloud, he believes, we need to develop a more secure model for how information travels. \u201cA sender should be able to determine the path that information packets should take,\u201d says Walfish. \u201cA receiver should not have to accept traffic that she does not want. An intermediate provider should be able to know where the packet\u2019s been and should be able to exercise its policies about the downstream provider that\u2019s going to handle the flow next.\u201d Walfish\u2019s system for providing such capacities, which he\u2019s developing with colleagues at Stanford, the Stevens Institute of Technology, and University of California-Berkeley, is called ICING . It\u2019s a set of protocols that allow every packet of information not only to plot out a path from beginning to end, choosing every provider along the way, but also to establish a chain of provenance as it goes that proves, to both the intermediaries and the final recipients, that it came from where it said it was coming from. \u201cWhat we do is take a packet, a unit of data, and we add some fields to the head of the packet,\u201d says Walfish, who in 2009 won an Air Force Young Investigator Award for work related to ICING. \u201cThese fields contain enough cryptographic information to be able to communicate to every realm along the way, and back to the sender, where the packet\u2019s been. So when a packet shows up, I know where it\u2019s been. I know whether it obeys the policies of everyone along the path. That property does not exist today.\u201d The advantages of such knowledge, says Walfish, should be considerable. Senders, for instance, could contract with intermediate providers for a kind of expressway through the Internet. Recipients would have an easier time sorting their incoming traffic into different levels of priority depending on the routes the packets took. Perhaps the greatest advantage of adopting a system like ICING, says Walfish, would come in the area of security. Targets of various kinds of Internet attacks, like denial-of-service attacks , would be able to sever traffic from their attackers faster and with much greater precision. Governments would be able to set up channels of communication that pass through only well-vetted and highly-trusted service providers. Internet security companies could, from anywhere in the world, inspect your traffic for viruses. \u201cRight now,\u201d says Walfish, \u201cthere are ways to deal with attackers, but they\u2019re crude, and they\u2019re reactive. Once the traffic enters the victim\u2019s network link, you\u2019re hosed. All you can do is shut it all down. It would be like if you had a huge line of people coming into your office, not letting you get work done. You could kick them all out, but you still wouldn\u2019t get any work done because you\u2019d spend all your time kicking them out. What you really need is for them to not show up in the first place.\u201d ICING, says Walfish, would also prevent \u201c IP hijacking ,\u201d a kind of attack in which a network provider redirects net traffic by falsely \u201cadvertising\u201d to hold a given IP address or by claiming to offer a more direct route to that address. Such IP hijackings can be globally disruptive. In 2008, for instance, the Pakistani government sought to block videos containing the controversial Danish cartoons that depicted Mohammed. The result was a global shutdown of Youtube for more than an hour. Last year, it\u2019s believed, China Telecom was able to capture 15% of the world\u2019s Internet traffic, for 18 minutes, by falsely claiming to be the source of more than 30,000 IP addresses. \u201cThere are multiple reasons why this wouldn\u2019t happen in ICING,\u201d says Walfish. \u201cFirst, in ICING, the contents of the advertisement and the name of the advertised destination are tightly bound; lie about one, and the other looks invalid . Second, because packets must respect policy, a packet taking an aberrant path will be detected as such.\u201d ICING, and its parent project NEBULA, are one of four multi-institutional projects being funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program . The point of the FIA program, and of the efforts of Walfish and his colleagues, is to step back from the day-to-day challenges of managing the flow of information on the \u2018net, and think more fundamentally about what kind of architecture the Internet should have going forward. \u201cWhere ICING was born, I think,\u201d says Walfish,  \u201cwas in the realization my teammates and I had that while there was a consensus about what kinds of things needed to change, and there were  a lot of proposals to make those changes, all the proposals seemed to be mutually exclusive. They all required the same space in packets. It would be like if your bike was out-of-date and someone said, oh, you can get this really cool feature if you just replace your front wheel with this wheel, and then someone else came along said, oh, you can get this other really cool feature, but you have to replace your front wheel with this wheel. Well, you can only have one front wheel. So what we set out to do was to design a much more general-purpose mechanism where you could get all these properties without their conflicting with each other, and that\u2019s what I think we\u2019ve done.\u201d News Categories Research Tags Security Internet",

    "text_content": "Racial Profiling to Limit Terror Attacks Is Fundamentally Flawed | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Racial Profiling to Limit Terror Attacks Is Fundamentally Flawed Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, November 19, 2010 AUSTIN, Texas\u2013Stop using racial profiling, says Professor William Press . He claims that as well as being politically and ethically questionable, racial profiling does no better in helping law enforcement officials in their task of catching terrorists than standard uniform random sampling techniques. This is the topic of a paper publishing in Significance, the magazine of the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association. Racial profiling rests on the idea that people from particular racial or ethnic groups are more likely to be involved in acts of terror than people from other groups. The theory then suggests that law enforcement officers should spend a greater proportion of their time scrutinizing people from the \u2018high risk\u2019 group. One problem with this approach is that innocent people who also belong to the targeted group rapidly become offended, and some may even become radicalized as a result. \u201cRacial profiling is as indiscriminate as deciding that people named Patrick are more likely to drink and drive, and so everyone who is named Patrick should be stopped and breathalysed more frequently than people with other names,\u201d says Press, the Warren J. and Viola M. Raymer Professor of computer science and integrative biology . Although it may be the case that some people named Patrick do drink and drive, he points out that there are clear problems in this profiling strategy. First, many Patricks don\u2019t drink and drive and will be unfairly detained. Secondly, this sort of profiling can have the appearance of success because if you keep testing more people named Patrick than other people, you are almost bound to find more Patricks who have drunk alcohol than people with other names. This then leads you to think the problem is even worse than you first suspected, and so you further increase the targeting of Patricks. In the Significance paper, Press takes a thorough mathematical and statistical view of the process that underlies racial profiling, and concludes that some forms of racial profiling may even result in a smaller chance of detaining a terrorist than carefully conducted standard sampling. In a world threatened by terrorists from a small number of countries, it is tempting to think that racial profiling for security purposes, even if morally objectionable, might save lives. \u201cBut uniform sampling, without the use of profiling, is surprisingly good. It is robust against false assumptions, it is deterrent, it is easy to implement, it is about as effective as any real-life system can be \u2013 and it is devoid of moral and political hazard,\u201d says Press. He believes that the choice between a strategy of profiling and one of uniform random sampling should not be viewed as difficult; uniform random sampling wins.

The free week-long camp illustrates the wow of a career in technology to selected Texas high school girls. Campers work together on projects, tour local technology companies, meet professional computer scientists, play games, enjoy campus life, and get a taste of what it\u2019s like to have a fascinating, well-paying job. This is the eighth time UTCS has hosted the camp. The reason? Women represent about 60 percent of college graduates nationally, but their representation in computer science is about 15 percent. Oftentimes, girls see computer science as too hard, geeky, or a solitary occupation. First Bytes offers a more accurate picture. The reality is that technological development is very collaborative. Corporations bend over backwards to keep highly trained professionals happy at work and home. And it is fun to create something new whether its benefit to society is profound or just amusing. Camp activities included career mentoring, programming language labs, logic games, computer dissection, and panel discussions. The finale event was an Oscar party, where the students showed movie shorts they created using the Alice programming language. All expenses were paid by generous sponsors, including Google, Lockheed Martin, Cisco Systems, Amazon.com, Texas Film Commission, and the Texas Workforce Commission. Google also funded the annual UTCS high school teacher\u2019s camp held in July. For more information visit the First Bytes website .

The certification meets the requirements for Information Systems Security Professionals and for System Certifiers certifications and is an important step toward earning a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education designation. Reliable and innovative cyber security solutions are key to commercial and national security given that information security affects daily life, business and governmental operations. Research highlighted by CIAS illustrates the problem: cyber criminals target nearly 1 in 5 companies with cyber extortion including theft of customer data and destruction or theft of intellectual property by cyber criminals; 1 in 20 U.S. adults were victims of on-line fraud and 1 in 50 were victims of identity theft; 105 million people have had their data compromised. Electronic crime is on the rise, despite the use of firewalls and physical security systems. The National Center of Academic Excellence designation and course of study will attract top talent to The University of Texas at Austin to study security issues and fill a national need for trained security professionals. \"CIAS's research and education efforts strive to reduce vulnerability in our national information infrastructure and address growing security risks in both business and governmental sectors. This certification is an important milestone in The University of Texas's ability to fill the significant education gap for data security professionals,\" said Dr. Mike Dahlin, Associate Director of CIAS. The University of Texas at Austin CIAS receives an official certificate, signed by the Committee on National Security Systems Chair, at a June 5, 2007 Awards Ceremony during the 11th Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE) held at Boston University.

For the past seven years the research team, led by Professors Doug Burger , Stephen Keckler and Kathryn McKinley , has been working on the design of the processor, an updated cross-platform compiler and the instruction set architecture needed to run it. The team's goal is to produce a scalable architecture that can accelerate industrial, consumer, embedded and scientific workloads, reaching trillions of calculations per second on a single chip. This radical new architecture can produce improved single-thread performance-at greater power efficiencies-than conventional designs. This technology, called Explicit Data Graph Execution (EDGE architectures) offers a flexible alternative to the current industrial direction of providing a greater number of processor cores with each passing generation. The TRIPS prototype processor is a working system that demonstrates the capabilities of this new EDGE technology. Its architecture is composed of many copies of a small number of replicated tiles, reducing complexity and improving ease of design. Produced with generous support from DARPA, each TRIPS prototype processor contains two processing cores, each of which can issue 16 operations per cycle with up to 1,024 instructions in flight simultaneously. The prototype is the first on a roadmap that will lead to ultra-powerful, flexible processors implemented in nanoscale technologies. This technology is expected to have significant impact on the computing industry.

Posted by Staci R Norman on Wednesday, February 14, 2007 AUSTIN, Texas - February 14, 2007 The CAREER Program offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of the early career-development activities of those teacher-scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization. These CAREER awards, in the amount of $400,000, recognize outstanding scientists and engineers who, early in their careers, show exceptional potential for leadership at the frontiers of knowledge and is the highest honor bestowed by the United States Government on scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers. Adam Klivans \"The Computational Complexity of Halfspace-Based Learning.\" My proposal aims to develop a set of powerful new algorithms in machine learning for halfspace-based classification tasks. Halfspace-based learning is at the core of many of today's most important learning tools such as Support Vector Machines and Boosting. I am also working towards proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of classical halfspace learning problems that have remained open for many years, such as learning the intersection of two halfspaces. Klivans' home page Emmett Witchel \"Operating System Support For Transactional Memory: Construction and Performance Scalability of Parallel Programs.\" As CPU manufacturers have shifted their performance improvement strategy from scaling clock frequency to placing multiple, simple processor cores on one chip, there has been a renewed interest in concurrent programming. My proposal addresses the problem of designing operating systems to work with transactional memory, which is a hardware feature that has been proposed to help make concurrent programming easier. The hardware and OS should work together to provide transactional memory, just as they work together to provide virtual memory. The challenges include identifying ways the OS can eliminate work for the hardware, a proper interface for the OS to express hints to hardware, and a programmer model for system calls within a transaction.

The free, weeklong camp showcases the potential of a rewarding career in technology to selected Texas high school girls. Campers work together on programming language labs and logic games, see surgical robots in action, meet professional computer scientists, get career mentoring, play games, enjoy campus life and get a taste of what it\u2019s like to have a fascinating, well-paying job. This year campers will visit a St. David\u2019s Hospital operating room to see how the robotic da Vinci Surgical System works. Campers will also participate in iPhone app programming challenges using IPRO, a virtual robotics program designed to teach computational literacy. Women represent about 60 percent of college graduates nationally, but their representation in computer science is only around 15 percent. Often, girls see computer science as too hard, geeky or solitary. First Bytes aims to paint the more accurate picture that technological development is very collaborative and employers go to great lengths to keep highly trained professionals happy at work and home. \u201cShowing girls this reality is paying off,\u201d says Tiffany Grady, assistant director of academics for the Department of Computer Science. \u201cThis year, 12 students who attended a First Bytes camp will be starting as freshman.\u201d The department has 43 freshmen women starting in 2011, which is 20 percent of the incoming freshman class of 211 students. This is an increase from 14 percent women in the 2010 incoming class. \u201cThe camp is an excellent way for women to learn more about the exciting world of computer science,\u201d says Grady. \u201cAlmost every company has a critical need to find top computer science graduates, and women are, and will continue to be, in high demand.\u201d Sponsors, including Bazaarvoice, Cisco Systems, Google, Lockheed Martin and the Texas Film Commission, pay all expenses for camp attendees. Google is also funding the annual First Bytes Workshop for Computer Science Teachers held in July. For more information visit the First Bytes Web site .

Robert Heath and Sanjay Shakkottai, fellow assistant professors in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, will also help lead an eight-university team to develop a novel theory that describes the performance limits of temporary, or ad-hoc, mobile wireless networks. Ad-hoc networks can be used anytime wired infrastructure is inaccessible, and enable the quick addition of network devices to the network. The technology could improve communications in emergency or military situations where users rapidly change locations. Countries with immature telecommunications infrastructure could use the approach to inexpensively deploy broadband Internet access.

    "text_content": "Mighty Morphing Power Processors | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Mighty Morphing Power Processors Posted by Staci R Norman on Monday, June 6, 2005 Even by the standards of the Lone Star State, the claim by two Texas researchers -- Douglas C. Burger and Stephen W. Keckler -- can seem a trifle grandiose. \"We're reinventing the computer,\" asserts Keckler A glance at their backers, though, dispels some of the skepticism. IBM ( IBM ) is working closely with the two University of Texas computer scientists. And the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2001 handed them $11 million in development funds. Now, IBM is gearing up to manufacture the first prototype of their concept for a radically new computer-brain chip. If it delivers what Burger and Keckler promise, high-tech gurus are betting it will spawn a new family of superchips from Big Blue -- chips capable of crunching a trillion calculations every second. Such blistering speed would itself be amazing; it's roughly the oomph of a $50 million supercomputer in 1997. But more impressive, the chip can rewire itself on the fly -- a feat known as reconfigurable computing. With this technology, a future Macintosh from Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL ) might rejigger the circuitry on its PowerPC chip and then run software written for Intel ( INTC ) Corp.'s microprocessors. Or an iPod music player could turn into a handheld computer -- or detect an incoming call and convert itself into a cell phone. IBM is hardly the only chipmaker chasing morphing semiconductors. Virtually every major supplier of so-called logic chips is working on some such notion, including Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ), Intel, NEC ( NIPNY ), Philips Electronics ( PHG ), and Texas Instruments ( TXN ). A dozen or more startups are in the race as well, including Velogix, picoChip Designs, and MathStar. Laying a new foundation for processors is crucial because the usual way of boosting performance, by adding more transistors, is running out of steam. Or rather, it's running into steam -- in the form of too much heat. The chips coming by 2008 will have circuit lines so skinny that an advanced microprocessor could sport roughly 20 miles of tiny wires. The juice needed to push signals through circuitry that long could generate enough heat to melt the wires. One way to avoid that is to carve up each silicon slab into two or more processors with shorter circuitry. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) Inc. is already doing this. Intel's upcoming \"dual core\" chips will further exploit this approach with something called Vanderpool Technology. These chips can simultaneously boot up two different operating systems -- say, Windows XP and Linux -- each running different software applications. BRAINY CONSOLE The brain in Sony ( SNE ) Corp.'s PlayStation 3 video-game console, slated to hit Japanese markets late this year, will contain nine processors: a PowerPC overseeing eight simpler processors. This multicore chip, called Cell, was developed jointly by IBM, Sony, and Toshiba ( TOSBF ). Sony claims the Cell will make the PlayStation 3 as powerful as Deep Blue, the IBM computer that dethroned chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. And Toshiba Corp. envisions Cell seeding a new generation of \"smart\" high-definition TVs and other consumer-electronics gear. Cell has another form of reconfigurability. Each sliver of silicon is studded with thousands of so-called eFuses. If the chip's watchdog circuit detects a malfunction, it will disconnect that segment by blowing one of the fuses, then call up spare circuitry that was held in reserve. IBM's Power5 chips also feature this technology. For Big Blue, eFuses have an economic benefit: IBM can crank out high volumes of identical chips, then blow fuses to tailor them for a given market. \"The graphics processor has to be configured one way in an IBM computer and another way for a Macintosh,\" notes Subramanian Iyer, an engineer and co-inventor of the eFuse technique. \"Before, we had to make two different chips and try to predict how many of each we would need. Now, we just make one chip.\" In terms of dexterity, though, the current champ of reconfigurability is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Think of an FPGA as a wire grid with silicon traffic lights at every junction. Special control instructions adjust the stop and go lights, directing electronic signals along a specific route. This process can map the zigzag path of a new circuit thousands of times a second. So the chip can create a custom circuit for processing each successive step in a program. Eventually, such chips may turn anything electronic into \"a mass market of one,\" says Ivo Bolsens, chief technology officer at Xilinx ( XLNX ) Inc., an FPGA supplier in San Jose, Calif. \"Say you buy a new remote control,\" he says. \"It starts out empty. But when you bring it home, it recognizes all the systems you have -- the make and model of your TV, your DVD player, your stereo -- and customizes itself to send the proper signals.\" FIENDISH PROGRAMMING While that degree of reconfigurability in consumer products is still down the road, FPGAs are finding their way into big computers. Last February supercomputer pioneer Cray ( CRAYE ) Inc. reported remarkable results with its compact new system, the Cray XD1. It's built with motherboards that each have one AMD chip and six FPGAs. Primed for breaking cryptographic codes, the FPGAs boosted speeds by 1,000 times. But that's unusual, admits Steven L. Scott, Cray's chief technology officer. More typical results come from geological modeling of oil company seismic data. At that, the XD1 was 15 times to 100 times faster. Unfortunately, writing the programs that rewire an FPGA is difficult and time consuming. But several academic institutions are striving to simplify the chore. The Ohio Supercomputer Center is assembling a library of mix-and-match software modules, for example. Programming the chip that's emerging in Texas won't be such a hassle, says Burger, because the chip was designed precisely to make the task easier. Partly that's done with multiple cores preconfigured for common logic operations, so the traffic switches just need to shunt signals to the proper core. Burger figures the transition to reconfigurable chips will stretch into the next decade. But Tsugio Makimoto, Sony's chief technology officer, predicts the turning point will be 2007. From then on, he expects adaptive chips to be the norm for new-product design efforts. Computer visionaries believe reconfigurability will help usher in the next leap in digital evolution: ubiquitous computing. Then, practically everything you touch at home or the office will contain chips that know you and your preferences -- and can talk wirelessly to nearby chips. For this new era, Intel plans a multicore chip for controlling not only PCs but also TVs, appliances, and copy machines. And a wireless networking chip, or a core, won't care whether the jabbering is wrapped in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi -- two different wireless standards. It will just adapt to whatever is in the air. How all this will be achieved is still uncertain. Current morphing techniques could get hammered by some new breakthrough, such as the FPGA-like grid in the works at Hewlett-Packard Co., which would replace silicon with a cheap conducting plastic. But among chip mavens, the vision of the final payoff is surprisingly consistent. All the smart gear in homes, offices, and cars is linked together, and no product will be frozen in time by the chips installed at the factory. With chameleon chips, regardless of how frenetic the pace of innovation becomes, even hardware upgrades will be just a download away.

The exercises included making three-point turns, detecting and avoiding obstacles, and stopping at stop signs to wait for other manned vehicles to pass before proceeding. Passing this test means Marvin will compete in the DARPA Urban Challenge National Qualification Event on Oct. 26-31. Both the National Qualification Event and the final Urban Challenge will take place at the urban military training facility located on the former George Air Force Base in Victorville, Calif. \"Creating autonomous vehicles has the potential to improve our society in many ways, ranging from saving fuel, lowering emissions, saving time and reducing fatalities on the road,\" says Dr. Peter Stone, assistant professor of computer sciences. \"It's also a wonderful opportunity to get undergraduates excited about and directly involved in cutting edge computer science research. \"This project started as an undergraduate research class as a part of the College of Natural Sciences' Freshman Research Initiative, and several of the undergraduates from the class continue to be deeply involved in the project.\" \"We couldn't be more excited,\" says ART team leader Dave Tuttle. \"Marvin had passed all the tests beautifully so we expected to be invited to the next stage of the competition, but it was not official until DARPA announced the list publicly. From the day after our site visit we've focused on the function needed to compete successfully in the nationals.\" The final DARPA Urban Challenge, on Nov. 3, will pit autonomous vehicles from around the globe against one another in a race through an artificial urban landscape. The challenge is intended to accelerate research and development in autonomous ground vehicles that could help save lives on the battlefield. These technologies eventually will be used in the conventional automotive market as well. The winners will receive $2 million, $1 million or $500,000 and opportunities to commercialize their research. The recent DARPA announcement pared the original list of 89 competitors down to 36. In preparation for the DARPA nationals, the team is seeking sponsors to assist with their travel and competition expenses. \"We are fortunate that The University of Texas at Austin and several other far-sighted sponsors who helped us early on made it possible for our entry to get to this point,\" says Tuttle. \"Now we ask Texas companies to step up and help us prove the value of our home-grown technology at one of the world's most prestigious events.\" Companies and individuals interested in becoming a Marvin sponsor or sponsoring autonomous vehicle research at The University of Texas at Austin should contact Dr. Peter Stone.

The free week-long camp showcases the potential of a career in technology to selected Texas high school girls. Campers attended presentations on subjects such as high level/low level programming, computer ethics, cryptography, logic games and gender roles. At Corporate Chat, professional women working in the field of computer science talked with girls over lunch about what it\u2019s like to have a fascinating, well-paying job and provided career mentoring. Lockheed Martin and Sandia Laboratories hosted a coding challenge. In the UTCS AI Lab, the girls watched humanoid robots play soccer and experienced virtual reality. The campers also had ample opportunity for hands-on learning. They participated in an iPhone app programming challenge, using IPRO, a virtual robotics program designed to teach computational literacy. The girls also learned to program a Windows 7 phone app in a lab hosted by Microsoft. Campers went on a field trip to St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery to see how the robotic da Vinci Surgical System works and had a hands-on experience of maneuvering the robotic arms in an operating room. Rivet Software guided the girls through a team building and communication game that involved logical thinking and problem solving. Groups of girls, some blindfolded or not allowed to talk, had to get a ball from point A to point B without dropping it using only a metal ring and a string for each girl. Cisco organized an activity that included brainstorming ways to develop an application to streamline the National Honor Society\u2019s (NHS) credit hours reporting process. Over half the campers are in NHS, which made designing this solution very interesting to them. Throughout the weeklong camp, the girls worked on a game development challenge. Campers worked in teams using the programming language Scratch from MIT to develop the game \"hangman\". Campers enjoyed campus life and had a taste of what it\u2019s like to be a UTCS student. Department advisors talked to the girls about earning a degree in computer science, getting into UT, dual majors, scholarships and career opportunities for UTCS graduates. They bowled at the Underground in the Texas Union, had a pool party, and played wallyball and racquetball at UT RecSports. Sponsors, including Bazaarvoice , Cisco Systems , Google , Lockheed Martin and the Texas Film Commission , pay all expenses for camp attendees. Google is also funding the annual First Bytes Workshop for Computer Science Teachers held in July. First Bytes Camp would not be possible the without the participation of individuals and companies that participate in the numerous presentations, labs and workshops throughout the weeklong camp: Tracy Laquey Parker of UTeach , Professor Dana Ballard , Professor Vijaya Ramachandran , Associate Professor Peter Stone , Analytical Graphics, Inc. , Bazaarvoice , Cisco Systems , CompassLearning , Google , KingsIsle Entertainment , Lockheed Martin , Microsoft , Mumboe , Rivet Software , Sandia Laboratories , St. David\u2019s Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery , and Yahoo! .

Dr. Simon Lam won the IEEE Computer Society's 2004 W. Wallace McDowell Award with the citation \"For outstanding fundamental contributions in network protocols and security services\". Please join us for the lectures and reception to congratulate Dr. Browne and Dr. Lam. Dr. Browne will speak on Quality and Productivity in Software Development Abstract: Developer productivity has increased an order of magnitude -- perhaps more for specific domains such as GUI development -- over the more than forty five years I have been involved in software development but a similar increase in quality is difficult to justify. The vision I project is the possibility of current research concepts to give an order of magnitude increase in both quality of software product and developer productivity, at least for well-specified domains. The concepts are component-oriented development, model-based development and design patterns. The extensions which enable integration of quality and productivity is property driven design based on component interfaces which enable both validation/verification and automated composition. Model-based and component-based development can enhance the effectiveness of verification and validation and validation methods including static analysis, testing and model checking. This lecture will sketch the relevant information on the concepts, how model-based and component-based development can enable more effective verification and validation and how this integration can be brought about. Visit Dr. Browne's web site at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/browne Dr. Lam will speak on Back to the Future Part 4: The Internet Abstract: In the past, the simplicity of Internet's IP protocol was its greatest strength in vanquishing competitors and becoming the de facto standard for inter-networking. The IP layer is now too economically important to modify to support new functionalities. As a result, IP is like a straitjacket that confines Internet's development to specific directions. As Internet's foundation, IP has some deficiencies. In this talk, we first survey the landscape of ideas in network protocol design. We then travel back in time to resurrect an old idea that may become the savior of the future Internet.

About the speaker: We are honored to have Dr. Ken Kennedy, Professor of Computational Engineering at Rice University speaking on High Performance Computing without a Degree in Computer Science. Dr. Kennedy is recognized nationally for his significant contributions to the field of Computer Science, and has been on the faculty at Rice since 1971. He received his B.A. from Rice in Mathematical Science in 1967, and a Ph.D. from NYU in Computer Science in 1971. Dr. Kennedy holds the Ann and John Doerr Professor in Computational Engineering In addition, he is the director of HiPerSoft, a Center for High Performance Software Research headquartered at Rice University, and he is also a Co-Chair of PITAC, the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. For more information on Dr. Kennedy, see: http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ken/ Topic: Increases in the complexity of both computer architectures and application structure have led to corresponding increases in the difficulty of application development, making it the nearly exclusive domain of the professional programmer. When combined with a shortage of programmers at the highest skill levels, this has created a software gap between the demand for new software and the ability of our workforce to deliver it. The long-term goal of this research effort is to make it possible for ordinary users, particularly scientists and engineers, to build their own high-performance applications, just as they were once able to do in the early days of Fortran. If this effort succeeds, it will facilitate a dramatic broadening of the community that can use high-performance computing platforms for problem solving. For more information on the topic, see http://www.ececs.rice.edu/kennedy03-10.html WHEN: 6 p.m., Monday, January 26, 2004 WHERE: Thompson Conference Center on the UT Campus next to the LBJ Library, Austin, Texas COST: Complimentary for Rice Alliance members and current full-time Rice University faculty, staff and students. $10 for non-members (cash/check only at the door; credit cards for online registration) RSVP: To register, please go to http://www.austinricealliance.org/events.htm .

The win came in the on-screen soccer competition, in which Stone\u2019s team and 11 others from Iran, Portugal and elsewhere each entered a \u201ccoach\u201d to guide on-screen players in their quest to beat the same opposing team. The coaches consisted of artificial-intelligence based computer programs that provided adaptable coaching advice to players. By seeing how earlier games panned out, Stone\u2019s team was able to develop a coach that used automatically learned rules generated from a decision-tree learning algorithm to sweep the competition. The computer sciences students participating in the coached simulation league were undergraduates Justin Lallinger and Bharat Kejriwal, and graduate student Greg Kuhlmann. Lallinger applied the finishing touches to the UT Austin Villa coach, and Kuhlmann was responsible for much of the machine learning used in the competition. The coached competition was one of two in which Stone entered teams. In the other, legged league, Stone and another student team entered Aibo robots in four games against similar robots. Each team\u2019s robots had the same hardware from Sony, but different software code developed from scratch by the scientists or embellished upon from previous competitions. Stone\u2019s team, which developed its code from scratch in the past five months, scored a goal in two of its games. The UT Austin Villa robots also finished fourth in unofficial scientific challenges at RobCup, which began July 2 and ends July 11. The win at the international RoboCup championship follows a second-place finish by Stone\u2019s team in the coached computer simulation league in the first RoboCup American Open, which was held in May in Pittsburgh. U. S. News & World Report ranks the graduate program of the university\u2019s Department of Computer Sciences among the top 10 nationally, and its program in artificial intelligence is number five nationally.

    "text_content": "New Digital Security Program Doesn't Protect as Promised | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content New Digital Security Program Doesn't Protect as Promised Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, September 29, 2009 From: The University of Texas at Austin News| Digital Security Program AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 University of Texas at Austin scientists have shown that they can break \"Vanish,\" a program that promised to self-destruct computer data, such as emails and photographs, and thereby protect a person's privacy. There is no way to permanently delete any material posted or sent through the Internet, and this leaves people's information vulnerable to breaches in privacy. Vanish, created by University of Washington researchers, claimed to solve that problem by encoding digital data so that they can only be read for a limited time window, such as eight hours. After that time, the data still exists, but it can no longer be read because the \"encryption key\" used to access it is no longer available. The data looks like digital gibberish. The Texas scientists, along with colleagues from Princeton University and the University of Michigan, created a program called \"Unvanish\" that makes Vanished data recoverable after it should have disappeared. \"Our goal with Unvanish is to discourage people from relying on the privacy of a system that is not actually private,\" says Emmett Witchel , assistant professor of computer science. \"We wish to respect the privacy concerns of people that might be using the Vanish system.\" The Vanish system encrypts data and takes advantage of the structure of peer-to-peer file sharing systems to manage encryption keys in a novel way. The keys are split up into many small pieces and stored at many different places on the network. Unvanish works by collecting and storing anything that looks like a fragment of a Vanish key on the network. Later, when given a message that should have disappeared, the program consults its archive of these fragments and finds the pieces it needs to decrypt the message. Using Unvanish, it is possible to make Vanish messages reappear long after they should have disappeared, nearly 100 percent of the time. \"Messages that self-destruct at a predetermined time would be very useful, especially where privacy is important,\" says Brent Waters , assistant professor of computer science. \"A true self-destruction feature continues to be challenging to provide.\" The lead programmer on the Texas research was computer science graduate student Owen Hofmann. Post-doctoral researcher Christopher Rossbach also contributed to the project. University of Michigan graduate student Scott Wolchok and Assistant Professor J. Alex Halderman and Princeton University Professor Edward Felten and graduate student Nadia Heninger independently broke the Vanish system.

We will describe application scenarios that motivate this work and provide a broad view of what advances in systems software are needed to make this vision a reality. In many application scenarios, datasets describe spatio-temporal regions. Our approach is to develop systems software able to leverage spatio-temporal descriptive metadata to support a broad range of application areas. We will describe techniques for optimized distributed data storage, indexing, retrieval and processing of ensembles of spatio-temporal datasets. We will then describe techniques for handing spatio-temporal and relational queries directed against these datasets distributed among storage systems located in multiple parallel machines and clusters. Finally, we will describe multiple-query optimization techniques that involve grid based semantic caching along with identification and exploitation of intermediate results shared between the queries.

    "text_content": "Edsger Wybe Dijkstra: 1930-2002 | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Edsger Wybe Dijkstra: 1930-2002 Posted by Staci R Norman on Tuesday, August 6, 2002 Professor Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, a noted pioneer of the science and industry of computing, died after a long struggle with cancer on 6 August 2002 at his home in Nuenen, the Netherlands. Dijkstra was born in 1930 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, the son of a chemist father and a mathematician mother. He graduated from the Gymnasium Erasmianum in Rotterdam and obtained degrees in mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Leyden and a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Amsterdam. He worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, 1952-62; was professor of mathematics, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1962-1984; and was a Burroughs Corporation research fellow, 1973-1984. He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computing Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, 1984-1999, and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1999. Dijkstra is survived by his wife of over forty years, Maria (Ria) C. Dijkstra Debets, by three children, Marcus J., Femke E., and computer scientist Rutger M. Dijkstra, and by two grandchildren. Dijkstra was the 1972 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, often viewed as the Nobel Prize for computing. He was a member of the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. He received the 1974 AFIPS Harry Goode Award, the 1982 IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, and the 1989 ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. Athens University of Economics awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2001. In 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra \"for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores\". Dijkstra is renowned for the insight that mathematical logic is and must be the basis for sensible computer program construction and for his contributions to mathematical methodology. He is responsible for the idea of building operating systems as explicitly synchronized sequential processes, for the formal development of computer programs, and for the intellectual foundations for the disciplined control of nondeterminacy. He is well known for his amazingly efficient shortest path algorithm and for having designed and coded the first Algol 60 compiler. He was famously the leader in the abolition of the GOTO statement from programming. Dijkstra was a prodigious writer. His entire collection of over thirteen hundred written works was digitally scanned and is accessible at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD . He also corresponded regularly with hundreds of friends and colleagues over the years --not by email but by conventional post. He strenuously preferred the fountain pen to the computer in producing his scholarly output and letters. Dijkstra was notorious for his wit, eloquence, and way with words, such as in his remark \"The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim\"; his advice to a promising researcher, who asked how to select a topic for research: \"Do only what only you can do\"; and his remark in his Turing Award lecture \"In their capacity as a tool, computers will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture. In their capacity as intellectual challenge, they are without precedent in the cultural history of mankind.\" Dijkstra enriched the language of computing with many concepts and phrases, such as structured programming, separation of concerns, synchronization, deadly embrace, dining philosophers, weakest precondition, guarded command, the excluded miracle, and the famous \"semaphores\" for controlling computer processes. The Oxford English Dictionary cites his use of the words \"vector\" and \"stack\" in a computing context. Dijkstra enjoyed playing Mozart for his friends on his Boesendorfer piano. He and his wife had a fondness for exploring state and national parks in their Volkswagen bus, dubbed the Touring Machine, in which he wrote many technical papers. Throughout his scientific career, Dijkstra formulated and pursued the highest academic ideals of scientific rigour untainted by commercial, managerial, or political considerations. Simplicity, beauty, and eloquence were his hallmarks, and his uncompromising insistence on elegance in programming and mathematics was an inspiration to thousands. He judged his own work by the highest standards and set a continuing challenge to his many friends to do the same. For the rest, he willingly undertook the role of Socrates, that of a gadfly to society, repeatedly goading his native and his adoptive country by remarking on the mistakes inherent in fashionable ideas and the dangers of time-serving compromises. Like Socrates, his most significant legacy is to those who engaged with him in small group discussions or scientific correspondence about half-formulated ideas and emerging discoveries. Particularly privileged are those who attended his reading groups in Eindhoven and Austin, known as the \"Tuesday Afternoon Clubs\". At Dijkstra's passage, let us recall Phaedo's parting remark about Socrates: \"we may truly say that of all the men of his time whom we have known, he was the wisest and justest and best.\" News Categories Faculty Tags Edsger W.

Fifteen to twenty 6th grade students are currently learning the in's and out's of RoboLab programming complete with building, programming, and testing their own robots. All efforts at Bedichek are concentrated toward Austin Science Fun Day in March 2004, where the students will present what they have learned through many short interactive demonstrations with other groups and observers. River City Youth Foundation Regular Volunteers: Melinda Chen, Minh Nguyen, Anthony Rubio, Crystal Monteiro, Dan Katz, Will Warner Every Saturday (10am-2pm) and Sunday (noon-4pm), UT ACM volunteers attend the River City Youth Foundation success center, where we work in the computer learning lab. \"At risk\" kids come from the neighborhood to learn more about computers, English, and what it's like to go to UT. Mentoring these students and encouraging them to learn and strive for excellence is a small service the UT ACM can give back to the community. Additionally, many hours have been spent cleaning up the RCYF's computer lab including reformatting, imaging, and hardware dissection. These two projects are the UTACM's largest volunteer project currently. We have a number of other projects awaiting volunteers, including various tech related small projects. Many of these projects are outlined here http://www.utacm.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=16 .

TIME: 4 pm - 6 pm PLACE: Hogg Memorial Auditorium (next to the Texas Union) DATE: March 3, 2003 Speaker: Richard Stallman Richard Stallman is the founder of the Gnu Project, launched in 1984 to develop the free operating system GNU (an acronym for \"GNU's Not Unix\"), and thereby give computer users the freedom that most of them have lost. GNU is free software: everyone is free to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. Today, Linux-based variants of the GNU system, based on the kernel Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are in widespread use. There are estimated to be some 20 million users of GNU/Linux systems today. Richard Stallman is the principal author of the GNU Compiler Collection, a portable optimizing compiler which was designed to support diverse architectures and multiple languages. The compiler now supports over 30 different architectures and 7 programming languages. Stallman also wrote the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other GNU programs. Stallman graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a B.A. in Physics. During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. In January 1984 he resigned from MIT to start the GNU project. Stallman received ACM's 1991 Grace Hopper Award for his development of the first Emacs editor. In 1990 he was named a MacArthur's Fellow, and in 1996 received an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. In 1998 he received the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award--sharing the honor with Barbara Simons and Linus Torvalds. Among his other awards are the Yuri Rubinski Award (1999) and a second honorary doctorate (2001) from the University of Glasgow, and sharing the Takeda Award for social/economic betterment with Linus Torvalds and Ken Sakamura. In 2002 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. Visit the Richard Stallman's personal homepage for more information. News Categories Events Tags Richard Stallman",

Ben Kuipers, CS department chairman, says \"The architecture is set up so all three units have space on every floor. There was already a lot of collaboration among the three groups, but now that we are down the hall from each other, it is much easier.\" Faculty and students began moving into the building in early August with the landscaping, patio areas, and fountain completed in September.

All freshmen and transfer students admitted for fall 2000 and subsequent semesters will be assigned this new code. These students must complete a four-course basic sequence before applying for admission as CS majors in either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Sciences program. The four courses are: CS307, CS315, M408C, and Phl313K. Students must have a UT GPA 2.45 or better in these courses to apply. Only the top 300 students in each admission class will be accepted as CS majors. Applications will be processed every January and August. The process for transferring into the department for other UT students has also changed. In the past, any student who had credit for M305G and some programming background and who earned a UT GPA of 2.0 or better, was allowed to change into the CS major. Our new policy will mandate completion of M408C and CS303E before a student can apply for a change of major. Admission will again be limited to as few as 50 students each year. These new programs were developed in response to the continuing growth of enrollment in our department. In fall 1999, there were 2,306 students who were declared CS majors-that number was up from 1,195 five years earlier. Ten years ago, in fall 1989, our enrollment was 947. Our faculty, facilities, and staff have all increased during the last 10 years, but have not approached the pace of our population growth. News Categories Undergraduate Program",

This research is attacking these challenges by proposing new technology-sensitive designs across three design categories: individual microarchitectural cores, large on-chip memory systems, and chip multiprocessors. The microarchitecture research is organized into two parts: a technology-based scalability analysis of current microarchitectures, to determine and quantify future microarchitectural bottlenecks, and an evaluation of the grid instruction processor--a new microarchitecture, containing two-dimensional arrays of functional units, which eliminates many of the microarchitecture bottlenecks that will arise from advancing technologies.\" Visit Doug Burger's homepage for more information.

    "text_content": "The Role of Domain-Specific Pretraining in Digital Discourse Analysis | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content The Role of Domain-Specific Pretraining in Digital Discourse Analysis Posted by Anita Shiva on Thursday, November 2, 2023 Smriti Singh spends a lot of time on social media. But, not in the way most students do. As a computer science graduate student, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) researcher, she\u2019s interested in applying her knowledge to the social and ethical nature of online discourse. During her undergraduate studies, she worked on an algorithm to identify sexist threats on Twitter. In her graduate grounded NLP course, Smriti began to look at the effectiveness of traditional language and vision models in picking up misogynistic undertones in online memes. Turns out, they aren\u2019t very effective. To help with her research, she recruited fellow second-year CS graduate student Amritha Haridasan. Like Smriti, Amritha noticed, and was disturbed by, the disproportionate amount of hate women on the internet, particularly public figures, receive. \u201cWe don\u2019t realize how much we interact with it every day,\u201d Amritha states. Amritha, who has experience working with computer vision models, hypothesized that a MultiModal model, incorporating both language and visual cues, would be more effective at identifying misogyny in memes. The existing body of research on MultiModal model use for misogyny detection is somewhat limited. Although separate language and visual-based models have been implemented to moderate content online for quite some time, Smriti and Amritha found that they are no longer sufficient for analyzing multimedia content, which is predominantly shared on social media platforms. Smriti states that \u201cMemes are very complex to interpret for language only models or even vision models. There are a lot of linguistic cues, but there are also a lot of visual cues that go into making these sort of subtly hateful or misogynistic memes.\u201d Under the guidance of their professor, Dr. Raymond Mooney, who supervised the project , Smriti and Amritha incorporated domain-specific pretraining to enhance the accuracy of their multimodal model. This technique empowers models to detect subtle visual and linguistic nuances by leveraging knowledge from an existing dataset. In this case, they utilized the Hateful Memes dataset from Facebook AI for pretraining, and trained their models on the Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Detection (MAMI), comprising 12,000 memes categorized as misogynistic. Each meme in the dataset is identified with one or more classifiers, including shaming, objectification, violence, and stereotypical. As they sorted through the MAMI dataset for the qualitative analysis of the model performance, they were shocked by the sheer explicitness of language and imagery found within the memes. Smriti could only describe this experience as \u201cpositively tragic.\" Continuing on, they conducted tests using a combination of language and vision models with their dataset. Notably, the blend of the language model BERT and vision model ViT proved to be the most effective once pretrained. Upon completing their study, they concluded that the pretrained BERT+ViT model markedly improved its capacity for detecting misogynistic memes. Additionally, Pretraining notably enhanced the model\u2019s ability to classify misogyny. In a striking example, post-pretraining, BERT successfully identified objectification in an image solely based on language cues. Smriti and Amritha presented their work at the Workshop on Online Abuse and Harm at ACL 2023, and their enthusiasm for further research in this field remains palpable. In fact, a recent emerging trend on Tik Tok has fueled their determination to dig deeper in this area. \u201cThere's this real concept called \u2018girl math\u2019, where illogical math statements are being made. And it's women themselves, calling it \u2018girl math\u2019. I feel like that is a low sense of humor and a bit problematic,\u201d Smriti explains. Expanding the project to video would take significantly more computing resources, as each frame of the video would need to be put through the detection model. In the meantime, Smriti and Amritha are focusing their efforts on applying MultiModal detection to multiple languages. Their work not only sheds light on the prevalence of online misogyny but also breaks ground on an innovative method for identifying and addressing it.

    "text_content": "Professor Vijay Chidambaram Creates Free Resource for Aspiring Computer Science Professors | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Professor Vijay Chidambaram Creates Free Resource for Aspiring Computer Science Professors Posted by Trinity Erales on Wednesday, November 15, 2023 Academia can be opaque from the outside to folks who wonder what being a professor is like. This can be a hurdle for aspiring graduate students, who are interested in the role, but are anxious about all the different things that are required as a professor. Vijay Chidambaram , Professor of Computer Science at UT Austin, has authored a book, \" The CS Assistant Professor Handbook: Essential know-how for new and aspiring computer science professors \", to tackle this challenge. The book offers insights into the life of a professor, tackling topics like pay, what a day in the life of a professor looks like, and how to balance the different demands of the profession. Chidambaram's motivation to create this handbook was inspired by his academic mentors, Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, professors at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Drawing from his own experiences, he has compiled a centralized resource that organizes and consolidates knowledge traditionally shared informally from professor to student. The primary goal is to make the assistant professor role more accessible and understandable for newcomers to the field. This book primarily targets new assistant professors and graduate students on the cusp of entering academia. It not only provides guidance on navigating the complex role of a professor but also offers an authentic view of what the job truly entails. It should also prove interesting to undergraduate students who are thinking about graduate school in preparation for being a professor one day. Notably, this resource is offered free of charge online making essential knowledge readily available to a broad audience; Chidambaram was inspired to do so by his academic mentors, who provide a widely popular textbook for operating systems freely available online. Chidambram\u2019s philosophy harmoniously aligns with UT Austin's culture, fostering a community of educators and researchers dedicated to continuous learning, innovation, and the refinement of teaching methods. As \"The CS Assistant Professor Handbook\" takes its place on academic bookshelves, it promises to be a significant contribution, not only to the University of Texas at Austin but also to the broader academic community. It sets a new standard for guiding and supporting the professors of tomorrow, ensuring that the next generation of academic leaders are well-prepared for the challenges of their roles.

    "text_content": "Understanding the Mathematical Foundations Behind Challenging Puzzle Design | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Understanding the Mathematical Foundations Behind Challenging Puzzle Design Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, February 1, 2024 Image Picture two rigid metal pieces tangled together. What steps would you take to untangle them? The most straightforward approach involves twisting each wire to line up the gaps and then pulling one through the other. The design of wire puzzles becomes more complex, like the ones below. Image At The University of Texas at Austin and McGill University, researchers are examining the geometrical aspects of puzzle creation and resolution. Dr. Xinya Zhang , a recent UT Computer Science doctoral graduate, collaborated with professors Dr. Etienne Vouga from UT Austin's Department of Computer Science and Dr. Paul Kry from McGill University's School of Computer Science. Together, they explored mathematical methodologies and theories in puzzle design, aiming to establish precise criteria for delineating the characteristics of a puzzle. A large bulk of previous research in puzzles tends to focus on the variability of solutions. However, there is little work designating the criteria for a puzzle\u2019s design. The team chose to investigate wire puzzles because their design makes it possible to perform a geometrical assessment of the puzzle\u2019s qualities and solutions. \u201cIt was the simplest geometry that could still give us interesting, non-trivial puzzles,\u201d Vouga says. Their primary consideration in puzzle selection was the requirement for a challenging experience. \u201c[If we look at non-puzzles], such as a nut and a bolt. There\u2019s not really much of a choice of what to do. You only screw it back and forth. On the other hand, if you have something like a hook on a ring, there\u2019s lots of flexibility there. It\u2019s also unconstrained,\u201d says Kry. Flexibility makes the wire puzzle a perfect option to assess a puzzles\u2019 level of challenge, as there are many different ways to move the wires around. The structure of the wire is referred to as a tunnel if it is straight and narrow, and as a curved pipe if it is not. The presence of bubbles, or the areas where the wires are loosely entangled, provides the space for the puzzle-solver to figure out a configuration to separate the wires. The team determined that in order for a wire puzzle to be considered challenging, it must contain curved pipes in its tunnel-bubble structure. The team also hypothesized this tunnel-bubble structure is effective in discerning puzzles from non-puzzles. Additionally, they noticed that disentanglement puzzles involved twisting moves to entwine segments of the two pieces around each other. The team proposes that absence of twistiness is a strong indicator of a non-puzzle. Since the wires themselves are still rigid, which lends itself to a computational analysis. To look for the existence of tunnel-bubble structure, the researchers created two quantitative metrics. With each disentanglement puzzle, they computed a solution (using an algorithm created in the team\u2019s previous study). Although the computed paths were not always the most optimal, or efficient, solution, it makes them more realistic since a puzzle is solved if any solution is found. Their approach also takes into account other steps a puzzle-solver may take, like finding a dead end or retracing their steps. To find the tunnel-bubble, or loops, in structures in the two wires of disentanglement, researchers introduced a metric of visibility volume. Visibility volume looks at how much clearance or area there is before the puzzle-solver collides with another wire. Remember, the point of solving a disentanglement puzzle is to untangle the wires without them touching. The team ultimately concluded that these features can contribute to an optimization model of a puzzle. Although their model could not comprehensively look at every aspect of a puzzle, it was effective at establishing a set of criteria for their future work. Their next step toward achieving that goal is to look at even more flexible puzzles, such as those with a rope. \u201c[Those puzzles] make the wire metal puzzles look easy, because their rigid objects. The algorithm would be much more challenging to compute,\u201d Kry says. With each puzzle they study, the team continues to examine components of their structure that make the puzzle challenging and enjoyable to its users. Ultimately, the team\u2019s goal is to utilize this criteria to come up with their own unique design. News Categories Graduate Students Research Tags Etienne Vouga Graphics and Visualization",

Given annually since 2018, the Held Prize recognizes \u201coutstanding, innovative, creative and influential research in the areas of combinatorial and discrete optimization, or related parts of computer science.\u201d Zuckerman and co-recipient Eshan Chattopadhyay from Cornell University are being honored for their groundbreaking work on randomness extraction and Ramsey graph construction, which has advanced theoretical computer science. This $100,000 prize is intended to recognize recent work (defined as published within the last eight years). Zuckerman is a professor whose research focuses primarily on pseudorandomness and the role of randomness in computing. He is perhaps best known for his work on randomness extractors and their applications, an area that his early work pioneered. He helped develop a new method of producing random numbers that could improve cybersecurity . His other research interests include coding theory, distributed computing, cryptography, inapproximability and other areas of complexity theory. Using an innovative and creative approach, Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman solved a longstanding open problem by introducing an algorithm that combines two independent low-quality random sources to create one high-quality random source. Previous attempts needed at least one of the two input sources to be of moderately high-quality. The new algorithm, called a two-source extractor, also gives a major improvement to an important mathematical problem in Ramsey Theory. Zuckerman was previously elected as an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Fellow and a Simons Foundation Investigator, and he has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship, a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, a Sloan Research Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award. The two recipients join 18 other individuals being recognized by the NAS this year for extraordinary scientific achievements in a wide range of fields spanning the physical, biological, social and medical sciences. The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and \u2014 with the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine \u2014 provides science, engineering and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.

    "text_content": "Celebrating 20 Years of Turing Scholars | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Celebrating 20 Years of Turing Scholars Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, October 26, 2023 This year, the Department of Computer Science is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Turing Scholars Honors Program , a milestone that recognizes the many talented students the program has seen since its inception. Over the years, the program has established itself as one of the premier computer science honors programs in the country, leaving a lasting impact on its graduates\u2019 academic and professional journeys. Dr. Elaine Rich \u2019s vision of a new curriculum to better serve advanced undergraduate computer science students led to the establishment of the Turing Scholars program. In its early years, Dr. Calvin Lin , the program\u2019s current director, faced the challenge of building recognition for the program. Now, the program has grown significantly and is highly sought after, attracting top-tier applicants from around the nation. Image Professor Calvin Lin with the first cohort of Turing Scholars, 2002. One of the program\u2019s key strengths lies in offering small-size honors classes, providing students with a unique learning environment. Dr. Lin\u2019s favorite course to teach over the years, Data Structures, is a cornerstone for Turing freshmen. The curiosity and profound engagement of his students make it an incredibly fun and rewarding teaching experience. \u201cI am continually surprised by the curiosity of my students when they pose questions or offer perspectives that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. I often leave the classroom thinking, \u201cWow, that was so much fun,\u201d says Dr. Lin. The program\u2019s impact extends beyond traditional coursework, Turing Scholars students find themselves delving into cutting-edge research, enriching their academic experience. For instance, Jennifer Mickel, a senior in the program, is actively involved in Artificial Intelligence research, collaborating with experts both within and beyond the university. Such opportunities, far from being exceptions, epitomize the norm within the program. In the second semester of his freshman year, current sophomore Christopher Hill had the opportunity to take a graduate level computer architecture course. These experiences showcase how early exposure to advanced courses propels students into specialized fields, setting the stage for impactful contributions to the world of computer science. \u201cThere were only a few people in the course, so you\u2019re all having an open discussion. It got me into computer architecture and exposed me to research papers and all these different aspects. Now, I\u2019m doing research with Dr. Lin in the same field,\u201d Hill says. A key component of the Turing Scholars curriculum is the undergraduate thesis, a culmination of a student's academic journey. Dr. Lin emphasizes how this thesis encourages students to ask critical questions, articulate and defend a position, work independently, manage their time, and communicate effectively\u2014a testament to the holistic educational approach of the program. \u201cIf you think of all these skills, you can get pieces of them in courses, but to do a successful honors thesis embodies so many of those skills,\u201d Dr. Lin says. This commitment to holistic skill development goes hand in hand with the program's emphasis on fostering a vibrant and supportive community. Recognizing that academic growth is just one part of a student's journey, incoming Turing students are invited to join the Turing Scholars Student Association (TSSA). The organization hosts a variety of social and career events to foster community among Turing Scholar students. As co-presidents of TSSA, Jennifer Mickel and Meyer Zinn (\u201824) actively create opportunities for students to engage with one another and get involved in leadership. This integration of academic excellence and community building defines the comprehensive educational experience Turing Scholars offers. \u201cWhen Jennifer and I started the year as co-presidents of TSSA, we were interested in the transformative role that TSSA can have on people\u2019s experiences as a student,\u201d Zinn says. Reflecting on their time in the program, Jennifer and Meyer share their insights and advice for incoming, and aspiring Turing students. Their emphasis on a supportive community and encouragement to reach out and build connections reflect the values that make Turing Scholars more than just an academic program. \u201cThe Turing Scholars community is very supportive. The classes are really hard, but peers who are doing better or who understand are always willing to help others who might not be there yet,\u201d Mickel says. \u201cWe try to encourage people to come to the honors office and say hi, introduce themselves. [You] may make a friend that you never would have interacted with otherwise, and build a connection that you wouldn\u2019t have thought,\u201d Zinn adds. As the program looks to the future, Dr. Lin hopes to continue improving the Turing curriculum and offer more career and research opportunities for students. Increased funding would allow the program to provide more scholarship opportunities to prospective students. In his time as director, Dr. Lin has seen many cohorts of students graduate and achieve success in their career. \u201cOne of the great thrills has been hearing back from students after they\u2019ve graduated and seeing how they\u2019re doing. They are appreciative of the resources they gained from their time in Turing,\u201d says Dr. Lin In celebrating two decades of the Turing Scholars program, we not only applaud its growth and achievements but also recognize the enduring impact it has had on the students. Here\u2019s to the next 20 years of shaping brilliant minds and fostering a legacy of excellence in computer science education.

The first lecture will be held Friday, January 25, 2002. Formal Methods is the topic this year. Lectures: 4:00 - 5:00 p.m. Avaya Auditorium, ACES 2.302 Reception: 5:00 - 6:00 p.m. Faculty Lounge, ACES 6.102 The Case Against a Grand Unification Theory Great challenges exist in developing and teaching the principles of software design. General theories for software design are too weak to be of value to the practitioners. Specialized theories that are developed for specific domains should play a central role, along with the structuring principles that bind the theories together. Jayadev Misra - Schlumberger Chair in Computer Sciences Jayadev Misra is a Professor in Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. His research interests are in distributed computing and foundations of programming theory. His primary focus at present is applying formal methods in practice, particularly in the specifications and designs of synchronous and asynchronous systems. Dr. Misra is a Fellow of the IEEE and ACM. He was a Guggenheim Fellow during 1989. Models: Moore and More As computers become ubiquitous, methods for ensuring correct program behavior become increasingly important. Classic manual proof-theoretic techniques have been studied for three decades, but due to the extraordinary mathematical demands placed on programmers, their practical applicability is hindered. For two decades, I have been developing an alternative, automated model-theoretic approach to program reasoning. One manifestation is model checking, a fully algorithmic method for checking that a finite model of program meets a temporal logic specification. An obvious criticism is the state explosion problem. Surprisingly, this has turned out to be much less severe in practice than expected. In this talk, I will discuss why. I will also explain my belief that advances in abstraction together with Moore's law mean that the effectiveness of model-theoretic methods will continue to scale up in the future. E. Allen Emerson - Endowed Professor in Computer Sciences E. Allen Emerson's research interests center around formal methods for establishing program correctness. He is co-recipient of the ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for the invention of symbolic model checking, a method for establishing correctness of computer systems widely used in the computer hardware industry and showing promise for software. He also serves as an editor for leading formal methods journals including ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, Formal Aspects of Computing, and Formal Methods in Systems Design.

    "text_content": "Paving the Way for a New Era in Crash Consistency Testing | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Paving the Way for a New Era in Crash Consistency Testing Posted by Trinity Erales on Wednesday, September 27, 2023 The work of researchers from The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Department of Computer Science in crash consistency has yielded a breakthrough innovation\u2014the Chipmunk system . At its core, Chipmunk zeroes in on a crucial mission\u2014meticulously testing file systems to identify and tackle crash consistency bugs that can significantly impact data integrity and system reliability. The UT Austin team has produced a promising solution that could pave the way for a new era in data storage and stability. Firing up your computer or scrolling through a smart device is a routine occurrence for most. Behind the scenes, the file system takes the reins, orchestrating the seamless loading of your files from the storage device within, whether that's the hard disk drive or solid-state drive (the two most common data storage methods). The file system, the unsung hero of our tech-driven world, oversees the task of managing file names, storage, and retrieval from our data repositories. These storage devices might be reliable, but they aren't the fastest part of a computer system. To compensate for this, the file system must thread the needle between speed and efficiency by optimizing data transfers. However, this complexity increases the potential for data loss in the event of an untimely system crash. Think of software like a mix of instructions, sometimes with annoying errors that disrupt how a computer works. In the digital world, problems with the file system can show up and stay even after a computer crash, causing data loss or corruption. In the field of software development, diligent efforts are directed toward perfecting data recovery strategies following system crashes, using various mechanisms to ensure stored data always ends up in a consistent state after a crash. However, if the implementation of these mechanisms is flawed, it can lead to problems. The team\u2019s research focuses on identifying these types of bugs known as crash consistency bugs. Chipmunk builds on Crash Monkey , a system developed by UT Computer Science Professor Vijay Chidambaram 's team. Crash Monkey's mission is to rigorously test popular file systems, aiming to spot crash consistency bugs. These bugs, notorious for their ability to destabilize systems and compromise data integrity, are remarkably hard to pin down and recreate. Researchers, consisting of graduate students Hayley LeBlanc , Shankara Pailoor, and Om Saran K R E, along with the guidance of assistant professor James Bornholt , and professors Isil Dillig and Vijay Chidbaram, have crafted Chipmunk. This specialized tool has been developed to evaluate file systems within the context of persistent memory. \u201dPersistent memory offers exciting opportunities for more reliable storage systems, but testing for crash consistency is key. Chipmunk has revealed valuable insights into persistent memory file system bugs. Our goal is to inspire better testing tools and more reliable storage systems,\" says lead researcher Hayley LeBlanc. While not yet a household name, persistent memory represents a promising frontier in the data landscape, offering the potential to store information for extended periods. This memory type also allows for precise updates and delivers speedier performance compared to standard storage. Overall, this research has already uncovered 23 bugs across five different file systems. These findings are merely an initial glimpse into what Chipmunk could uncover. Imagine Chipmunk as a digital detective, it can either expose glaring issues or embark on intricate investigations, generating random tests to unveil elusive bugs that remain hidden from conventional methods. As we peer into the future, Chipmunk promises to unlock the potential of persistent memory, one bug at a time. In May of this year, Chipmunk's research efforts received acclaim when it secured an award at the EuroSys conference , where it was honored as one of the top three best papers. Taking on crash consistency challenges, Chipmunk promises to boost persistent memory storage's performance. Chipmunk could revolutionize persistent memory code testing, empowering researchers to address common and complex bugs, heralding a new era of innovation.

    "text_content": "Unlocking the Power of Bilevel Optimization: BOME | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Unlocking the Power of Bilevel Optimization: BOME Posted by Trinity Erales on Wednesday, November 8, 2023 In mathematical optimization, a new approach is emerging, promising to transform how we tackle intricate challenges across various domains. Consider the complexity of bilevel optimization, a problem that has confounded experts in machine learning, engineering, and other fields. Recent advances are providing new insights into this intricate landscape, presenting a streamlined technique that has the potential to significantly enhance our ability to navigate these complex problems. UT Computer Science researchers have pioneered a technique known as Bilevel Optimization Made Easy (BOME) presented in NeurIPS 2022, which presents a more efficient way to address bilevel optimization problems. BOME deviates from conventional methods, providing a better fit for deep learning applications and offering increased flexibility in managing the constraints of lower-level problems. To truly grasp the significance of BOME, it's essential to understand the intricacies of bilevel optimization. Imagine being tasked with optimizing the placement of new roads in a city. Each potential road configuration gives rise to a nested optimization problem: determining how traffic would flow on these new roads. This introduces two levels of optimization - high-level road placement and low-level traffic optimization. Traditional approaches, like gradient descent, often struggle to efficiently manage the interplay between these two levels, leading to computational challenges. This is where BOME steps in. \u201cWhen there are two levels, the gradients can get quite difficult to compute,\u201d says UT Professor Peter Stone. \u201cBOME is a method to do so more efficiently.\u201d Researchers Bo Liu , Mao Ye and Professors Qiang Liu and Peter Stone from UT Austin, and Prof. Stephen J Wright from UW-Madison developed BOME as a method to handle such complexity more effectively. The core principle revolves around leveraging first-order optimization techniques, simplifying the process and facilitating smoother computation of gradients in scenarios involving multiple levels of optimization. This newfound efficiency positions BOME as an appealing solution, particularly within the realm of hyperparameter optimization. In this context, each machine learning program represents an optimization problem, and finding the optimal program necessitates solving numerous such problems. As the field of AI witnesses the emergence of larger and more potent models,  efficient and scalable bilevel optimization algorithms become increasingly needed. \u201cBOME, as a simple and scalable bilevel optimization algorithm that solely relies on first order information, allows us to push the frontiers of an array of key challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter optimization and multi-level decision making,\u201d said UT Associate Professor Qiang Liu.

When I had transferred into the Department of Computer Science I didn\u2019t have any friends in CS and I found it intimidating talking to people in my classes. However, when I was working at these summer academies, the other PAs and I became very close over the two weeks we were together and became inseparable. All of the PAs were so nice and welcoming and it was amazing getting to know them and build friendships with each of them. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I could go back and give advice to myself coming into UTCS I would tell myself to not be afraid to put myself out there and attend career fairs, network, and apply to internships even if I\u2019m not completely sure I\u2019ll get the job. If you never apply or try to do something you\u2019re interested in then it is guaranteed that you will not get it. However, if you apply then at least you can say you tried your best and you might even get what you wanted, and even if you don\u2019t then you can still gain application and/or interview experience.

Jet lagged before a conference, Keshav Pingali , professor of Computer Science and core faculty member at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, found himself unable to sleep. His response to this restlessness will feel familiar to many a reader: he opened his laptop to check his email. Pingali was met with a delightful surprise in his inbox - a message from the chair of the ACM/IEEE Ken Kennedy Award informing him that he was the recipient of the 2023 prize. The Ken Kennedy Award highlights groundbreaking achievements in high performance and parallel computing, a technique which allows many computational processes to be carried out simultaneously. Pingali has been recognized for his vast contributions to the field, including work on programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems for multicore, manycore, and distributed computers. His work has been incorporated into a majority of open source and commercial compilers and is used widely in research and industry. His most recent research has focused on foundational parallel programming abstractions and implementations for irregular algorithms, which use complex data structures like sparse matrices and graphs. Pingali\u2019s \u201coperator formulation of algorithms\u201d is a programming and execution model that captures patterns of parallelism in these irregular algorithms, where traditional techniques used to parallelize regular dense matrix algorithms typically fail. Pingali, who holds the W.A \u201cTex\u201d Moncrief, Jr. Chair in Distributed and Grid Computing at The University of Texas at Austin, is also being recognized for his leadership on the Galois Project, which implements the model for use in diverse areas, including real-time intrusion detection in computer networks, parallel tools for asynchronous circuit design, and machine learning on graphs for drug discovery. His success with this project was hard fought. While \u201c The TAO of Parallelism in Algorithms ,\u201d is now one of Pingali\u2019s most highly cited papers, the results were not initially considered to be of mainstream interest in parallel programming. He remembers the work being \u201crejected from seven or eight conferences before it was finally accepted at PLDI , a top conference in parallel programming!\u201d The acceptance opened a gateway that made it easier to publish results and develop the project. Now, in the midst of receiving the Ken Kennedy Award for his efforts, Pingali has been met with feelings of joy, honor, and a slight touch of vindication after \u201cpersevering through setbacks and rejections!\u201d \u201cThe late Ken Kennedy was a professor at Rice University and a major figure in parallel programming whom I knew quite well, so I felt honored to have received the award named for him,\u201d Pingali shared. The Ken Kennedy Award is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE CS , and was established in 2009 to recognize substantial contributions to programmability and productivity in computing and significant community service or mentoring contributions. It was named for the late Ken Kennedy, founder of Rice University\u2019s computer science program and a world expert on high performance computing. The Kennedy Award carries a US $5,000 honorarium endowed by IEEE CS and ACM.

Intel is proud to announce the donation of some of its most advanced PC and networking equipment to UT Austin. The purpose of this donation is to equip the university with a state-of-the-art facility to enable research and course development on Intel's family of IXP(R) network processors. With this facility, students and faculty will be to access a computer network that can be configured to execute a large variety of communication and networking functions. \"The fascinating aspect of network processors,\" states Dr. Raj Yavatkar, senior software architect for Intel's network processor division, \"is the fact that based on the software that is developed for them, these devices can perform very different tasks.\" Dr. Yavatkar will be officially launching this Lab on November 6, 2001, followed by a presentation to faculty and students on network processing. Traditionally, different communications and networking functions were handled by custom-made, special-purpose microprocessors. The fact that these devices, also known as Application Specific Instruction-Set Computers or ASICs were custom made for each application made them expensive and their development slow. Today, with the advent of network processors, specific, customized functions are created in software and simply executed by the processor. This not only saves precious time in the creation of new networking and communications applications but also makes their actual development much less expensive. UT Austin students will now be able to learn the ins and outs of programming Intel's IXP (R) family of processors as well as inventing innovative new software applications for them. \"We are pleased to have this Lab operational,\" states Dr. Harrick Vin, head researcher for this project. \"Not only are we able to carry out cutting-edge research here, we're also preparing our students with the critical skills of programming these complex new devices.\" Please join us on Tuesday, November 6, 2001, at 2:30pm in ACES 6.402 for a brief presentation and the UT Austin IXA Lab ribbon cutting ceremony. Following the open house and reception, Raj Yavatkar, Intel's Chief Software Architect for IXA, will present a Friends of Computer Science Technology Leaders Lecture.

    "text_content": "Transforming Human-Robot Interaction Through Mood Inducing Music | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Transforming Human-Robot Interaction Through Mood Inducing Music Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, May 6, 2024 Music has always had the power to stir our emotions, from the exhilaration of a fast-paced rock anthem to the melancholy of a soulful ballad. But, could the music we listen to also affect how we make decisions, especially in our interactions with robots? This intriguing question lies at the heart of a study conducted by UT Austin Assistant Professor Elad Liebman and Professor Peter Stone . Imagine a world where robots not only understand our commands but also our emotional states. Liebman and Stone\u2019s research suggests that such a scenario may not be far-fetched. Current studies show that robots can enhance their decision-making and interactions with humans by considering the music we're immersed in. Liebman elaborates on this idea, saying, \"It is interesting to see how machine learning can be used to model personal experience. For instance, music that's being listened to in the background changes the way that people act in measurable ways and we've discovered that, if the agent is aware of the background music, or the music that the person is listening to, it can factor that into its decision making\u201d. Previous studies conducted by Stone, Leibman and Dr. Corey White of Syracuse University have highlighted how music can significantly impact our emotions and, consequently, our decision-making processes. For instance, upbeat, cheerful music might make us more inclined to take risks, while somber melodies could lead to more cautious choices. This connection between music and decision-making is well-established in cognitive psychology. Liebman and Stone\u2019s most recent paper, \u201c Utilizing Mood-Inducing Background Music in Human-Robot Interaction \u201d builds upon this foundation. It investigates whether autonomous robots could harness the knowledge of the music accompanying a person's actions to better predict their behavior. This novel approach opens up exciting possibilities for robots to become more attuned to human emotions, thereby enhancing their ability to collaborate effectively. In their study, participants were tasked with controlling a simulated car through an intersection while listening to background music. At the same time, another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, also traversed the same intersection from a different direction. This setup forced participants to anticipate the autonomous vehicle's movements and make decisions accordingly. The autonomous agent in the experiment was not a rigid, rule-based entity but rather a learning agent motivated by the same goal as the participants: to cross the intersection safely and swiftly. This setup allowed the researchers to explore whether knowledge of the background music influenced the robot's decision-making, ultimately affecting the outcome of the interaction. The research shows an interesting finding: when an autonomous robot is aware of the background music that its human partner is listening to during an experiment, it can better anticipate and adapt to human actions. This advancement holds promise for improving human-robot interactions, such as self-driving cars and personal assistants understanding our emotional states, ultimately resulting in safer and more intuitive interactions. This advancement is part of a larger trend toward creating emotionally intelligent robots that can interpret and respond to human feelings and environmental cues. The integration of emotional intelligence into robotics opens new avenues for advancements in fields like therapy, elder care, and education, where understanding and reacting appropriately to human emotions are crucial. Moreover, as robots become more integrated into everyday life, the ability to understand and interact based on emotional cues will be essential for human-robot interactions. As with any groundbreaking technology, ethical considerations arise. While Stone and Liebman touch on the importance of discussing the ethics of using background information in human-robot interactions and the potential for subtle manipulation, this topic lies beyond the scope of the research. The discussion of ethical considerations highlights the need for a broader conversation on the implications of such technology. Liebman and Stone\u2019s research provides a glimpse into the promising future of the way society interacts with technology, where music serves as a bridge connecting our emotions to artificial intelligence algorithms. Human-robot collaboration is just beginning, and the melodies we create may revolutionize the way we coexist with our mechanical counterparts.

I'm actively involved in Texas ACM and CS Roadshow, and my favorite memory so far has been the Texas ACM day trip to Pedernales Falls State Park. The trip to the state park allowed members to bond outside of the classroom and explore nature together. Whether it was the cave exploring, swimming in the river, or playing card games for hours, the experience formed lasting relationships with my classmates beyond our classes. The student organizations at UT made me feel like I belong in the community, and my journey throughout university would not be the same without them. Best place to eat in Austin?

When I had transferred into the Department of Computer Science I didn\u2019t have any friends in CS and I found it intimidating talking to people in my classes.

All of the PAs were so nice and welcoming and it was amazing getting to know them and build friendships with each of them. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I could go back and give advice to myself coming into UTCS I would tell myself to not be afraid to put myself out there and attend career fairs, network, and apply to internships even if I\u2019m not completely sure I\u2019ll get the job.

What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I think I've handled the curriculum well  and been fairly successful up until this point, so I wouldn't give myself any particular academic advice.

It can feel scary to adapt to the college workload and environment at first, but getting to know peers who are all in the same boat makes everything so much better.

Uchi Kaitlyn Rouse Year in college: Junior Hometown: New Braunfels, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: Crazy as it sounds, my favorite CS experiences have been the hours spent sitting in office hours for my computer science courses. It is such a unique feeling to walk into a room and be instantly surrounded by people that support you and understand exactly what you\u2019re struggling with. Computer Science is a tough major to navigate through alone, and office hours are a safe space to share your challenges and grow with your peers. From late-night coding sessions to post-exam In and Out runs, I\u2019ve made great memories and lifelong friendships with the people I\u2019ve met in this major. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Looking back at my first semester in UTCS, I don\u2019t remember what I got on my first programming assignment or how well I did on the final exam. I remember Wednesday lunches with my Pod, karaoke nights in the dorms, and watching the sunrise from the Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge with my best friends. My advice to my freshman self is this: step out of your comfort zone and seize every opportunity to make lasting memories. Best place to eat in Austin? I\u2019m a sucker for anywhere I can get a good bowl of pasta, so my go-to places are Cipollina, Patrizi\u2019s, and North Italia!

Your health is important!! School is not more important than sleep and food. Best place to eat in Austin? P Terry's has a special place in my heart <3 Megan Sundheim Year in college: Senior Hometown: Austin, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS has been the small, tight-knit community I\u2019ve helped build with my friends from Pod! Since I had completed a summer internship prior to my freshman year at UT with several of my Pod-mates, I had the opportunity to further forge and deepen those connections through sharing classes and participating in Pod activities with those amazing people. Whether it be throwing late-night pizza party study sessions in the library before an exam, goofing around constantly through Discord, going to fun social events with fellow CS majors in my spirit organization, or simply having a support network for when I struggle with assignments or stress, being able to go through the CS program with my best friends has been the highlight of my UTCS experience so far! What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I could go back to when I was coming into UTCS, I would establish a core support group of other CS majors sooner than later. A support group can be there for group study sessions, working together on understanding UTCS coursework, and hanging out in between classes. When I started in UTCS, I thought I could go it alone, but having a core group of friends that get you can not only can be the best medicine to midterm season stress, but also can make you a better, more well-rounded person overall. Best place to eat in Austin?

Tejaswi Thapa Year in College: Junior Hometown: Denton, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: One of my recent favorite experiences at UTCS was when me and some of my friends grabbed dinner together at the West Campus food trucks after the CS 439 final exam. Finishing my last final and wrapping up a grueling semesters was a bittersweet moment for me but I'm glad to have shared it with some of the people who were beside me along the way. Some of my other favorite experiences at UTCS are working on group programming assignments. My group's impressive ability to set up shop at any place on campus while still finding moments to chat and laugh has been the most memorable part of my semester. Another one of my favorite experiences has been watching my last pod cohort's students grow as the semester and year progressed. Seeing them branch out of their comfort zones, make new friendships, and find a sense of belonging at UTCS has been the most rewarding part of my role as a Pod Mentor. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? Balance academics and social life! Both are essential to your overall experience at UTCS. Best place to eat in Austin? Titaya's Thai Cuisine Hima Tummalapalli Year in college: Junior Hometown: Carrollton, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: I've had many great experiences in UTCS so far. I've gotten to learn a lot through my classes, but also through hackathons and organizations like DiRP. Additionally, I've made some really close friends in this department who have been a part of my journey in CS thus far. I was also a pod mentor last school year, and I had a really good time welcoming the new freshmen into UTCS. I've had a lot of great experiences in UTCS, and I'm really grateful for them. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would probably advise myself to get more involved in organizations, especially freshman year. I found it hard to balance being in clubs while doing schoolwork, but I think I should have tried to do that better since getting involved in clubs can give you really good experience in skills that you may not be able to develop just from your classes. Nidhi Venigalla Year in College: Junior Hometown: Springfield, IL Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS has probably been the CS Pods. CS Pods helped me feel less alone my freshman year and get to know my peers and make new friends; I was really grateful for the community that CS Pods helped me find. Meeting new people in general has been one of my favorite experiences in UTCS; I've met some of my closest friends through UTCS and am so glad that I had the opportunity to!

I would tell myself that everybody feels this way, and that it is incredibly common to feel imposter syndrome and as if you know less than the people around you; I would tell myself that it is okay to feel this way, and that I should be proud of myself for getting to where I am. Best place to eat in Austin? Ramen Tatsuya! Chenyi Wang Year in College: Sophomore Hometown: Hangzhou, China Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite experience in UTCS so far has definitely been the friends I was able to easily make during the first week of CS312. I remember sitting down next to four random people on the first day of lecture, those four ended up becoming my friends that I still hang out with in and out of school. We would study together before exams and always grab food before heading to the exam room, even hanging out and going to social events to decompress after. The people within UTCS are all incredibly driven and friendly and immersing yourself in that will provide you the best experience navigating through college life. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would say the biggest piece of advice I would give to myself had I known earlier is to give myself a set schedule. I remember stressing about assignments and spending hours just sitting down stuck on a single bug, working past the time I gave myself, and skipping things I had planned for myself such as going to the gym. However, once I told myself that I need to get up and do what I had originally planned, I felt much more efficient and was even able to finish the assignment after clearing my head. Best place to eat in Austin? I really recommend QI Austin if you\u2019re looking for the best dim sum in the city, though it is a little pricey. Gregory Zachariah Year in college: Sophomore Hometown: Sugar Land, TX Favorite C S experience so far and why: My favorite CS experience so far is the ever-present community that is present. Coming into such a huge school and rigorous program, it felt quite easy to get lost in all the action. Regardless of what the next rigorous CS class I would be taking, the support system around me turned what would\u2019ve been a stressful semester into a period of inspiring mutual growth and memories. Whether spending my entire afternoon in office hours at GDC, working on pitching a product for an org, or depleting all my remaining dining dollars at Lucky Lab with friends, the inclusive environment fostered by the department and my peers was an aspect I never expected from UTCS. Being able to learn the ropes of such challenging courses with the help of the people I met along the way has helped to narrow down this massive student population into a community I can call my own. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? If I were to go back and give myself some advice coming into UTCS, it would be to embrace failure, expect things to not always work out on the first try, and not let disappointment dictate how you move forward. Best place to eat in Austin? Though I haven\u2019t had a chance to fully venture out into Austin\u2019s food scene, K-Bop is definitely a top contender for places to eat. Being relatively affordable and close to campus, their Beef Bulgogi bowls were a treat after a stressful few weeks of preparing for my CS exams. Batyr Zhangabylov Year in college: Sophomore Hometown: Atyrau, Kazakhstan Favorite C S experience so far and why : My favorite thing about UTCS has been the opportunity to be surrounded by such a talented and supportive community. From world-class professors to so many great students, everyone has been nothing short of friendly and supportive. There are people from all walks of life, making it a great collaborative but also a very welcoming environment for anyone joining. We have an extremely diverse and well-rounded cohort of people, which I believe is what drives success and makes each experience so memorable. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? One piece of advice I would give at the start of the year is to take advantage of all the opportunities on campus, but also make sure to prioritize and manage your time well. It can be easy to get overwhelmed when you first arrive at such a busy place with so many people, but you have a few years here, so there is no need to rush. Best place to eat in Austin?

    "text_content": "Artificial Intelligence Trained to Draw Inspiration From Images, Not Copy Them | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Artificial Intelligence Trained to Draw Inspiration From Images, Not Copy Them Posted by Staff Writer on Friday, May 17, 2024 A new framework, led by a University of Texas at Austin research team, helps a type of generative artificial intelligence that creates images to avoid replicating existing works. Credit - The University of Texas at Austin Researchers are using corrupted data to help generative AI models avoid the misuse of images under copyright. Powerful new artificial intelligence models sometimes, quite famously, get things wrong \u2014 whether hallucinating false information or memorizing others\u2019 work and offering it up as their own. To address the latter, researchers led by a team at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a framework to train AI models on images corrupted beyond recognition. DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are among the text-to-image diffusion generative AI models that can turn arbitrary user text into highly realistic images. All three are now facing lawsuits from artists who allege generated samples replicate their work. Trained on billions of image-text pairs that are not publicly available, the models are capable of generating high-quality imagery from textual prompts but may draw on copyrighted images that they then replicate. The newly proposed framework, called Ambient Diffusion , gets around this problem by training diffusion models through access only to corrupted image-based data. Early efforts suggest the framework is able to continue to generate high-quality samples without ever seeing anything that\u2019s recognizable as the original source images. Ambient Diffusion was originally presented at NeurIPS, a top machine-learning conference, in 2023 and has since been adapted and extended. The follow-up paper, \u201c Consistent Diffusion Meets Tweedie ,\u201d was accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning. In collaboration with Constantinos Daskalakis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the team extended the framework to train diffusion models on data sets of images corrupted by other types of noise, rather than by simply masking pixels, and on larger data sets. \u201cThe framework could prove useful for scientific and medical applications, too,\u201d said Adam Klivans, a professor of computer science, who was involved in the work. \u201cThat would be true for basically any research where it is expensive or impossible to have a full set of uncorrupted data, from black hole imaging to certain types of MRI scans.\u201d Klivans\u2014along with Alex Dimakis, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, and other collaborators in the multi-institution Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning directed by the two UT faculty members\u2014experimented first by training a diffusion model on a set of 3,000 images of celebrities, then using that model to generate new samples. In the experiment, the diffusion model trained on clean data blatantly copied the training examples. But when researchers corrupted the training data, randomly masking up to 90% of individual pixels in an image, and retrained the model with their new approach, the generated samples remained high quality but looked very different. The model can still generate human faces, but the generated ones are sufficiently different from the training images. \u201cOur framework allows for controlling the trade-off between memorization and performance,\u201d said Giannis Daras, a computer science graduate student who led the work. \u201cAs the level of corruption encountered during training increases, the memorization of the training set decreases.\u201d The researchers said this points to a solution that, though it may change performance, will never output noise. The framework offers an example of how academic researchers are advancing artificial intelligence to meet societal needs, a key theme this year at The University of Texas at Austin, which has declared 2024 the \u201c Year of AI .\u201d The research team included members from the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. Funding for the research was provided by the National Science Foundation, Western Digital, Amazon, Cisco and The University of Texas at Austin. Daras is the recipient of the Onassis Fellowship, Bodossaki Fellowship and Leventis Fellowship, and Dimakis is Stanley P. Finch Centennial Professor in Engineering.

I remember sitting down next to four random people on the first day of lecture, those four ended up becoming my friends that I still hang out with in and out of school. We would study together before exams and always grab food before heading to the exam room, even hanging out and going to social events to decompress after. The people within UTCS are all incredibly driven and friendly and immersing yourself in that will provide you the best experience navigating through college life. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would say the biggest piece of advice I would give to myself had I known earlier is to give myself a set schedule. I remember stressing about assignments and spending hours just sitting down stuck on a single bug, working past the time I gave myself, and skipping things I had planned for myself such as going to the gym. However, once I told myself that I need to get up and do what I had originally planned, I felt much more efficient and was even able to finish the assignment after clearing my head. Best place to eat in Austin? I really recommend QI Austin if you\u2019re looking for the best dim sum in the city, though it is a little pricey.",

Image UMass Amherst's Hochul Hwang (L) and Gail Gunn with her guide dog (R). Credit - Zinj Guo What features does a robotic guide dog need? Ask the blind, say researchers behind an award-winning paper led by University of Massachusetts Amherst computer scientists and involving The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Joydeep Biswas. The study, which identified how to develop robot guide dogs with insights from guide dog users and trainers, won a Best Paper Award at CHI 2024: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), the leading venue for human-computer interaction research. Guide dogs enable remarkable autonomy and mobility for their handlers. However, only a fraction of people with visual impairments have one of these companions. The barriers include the scarcity of trained dogs, cost (which is $40,000 for training alone), allergies and other physical limitations that preclude caring for a dog. Robots have the potential to step in where canines can\u2019t and address a truly gaping need\u2014 if designers can get the features right. \u201cThis paper really takes a user-first perspective to developing guide-dog robots: by starting out with a thorough analysis of interviews and observation sessions with dog guide handlers and trainers,\u201d said Biswas, an associate professor of computer science. Image A robotic guide dog being tested. Credit - Zinj Guo The research team worked with 23 visually impaired dog-guide handlers and five trainers. Through thematic analysis, they distilled the current limitations of canine guide dogs and the traits handlers are looking for in an effective guide with considerations to make for future robotic guide dogs. \u201cWe\u2019re not the first ones to develop guide-dog robots,\u201d said Donghyun Kim , assistant professor in the UMass Amherst Manning College of Information and Computer Science (CICS) and one of the corresponding authors of the paper. \u201cThere are 40 years of study there, and none of these robots are actually used by end users. We tried to tackle that problem first so that, before we develop the technology, we understand how they use the animal guide dog and what technology they are waiting for.\u201d Nuanced themes came from the interviews, such as the delicate balance between robot autonomy and human control \u2013 all issues important to understanding how to develop robots deployable in the real world. In other examples, researchers learned about the importance of extended battery life for ensuring the robots would meet real-world needs for visually impaired commuters and providing clarity about the importance of guidance to follow the street (as a sidewalk does) versus always heading in the same direction. Biswas brought to the project experience in creating artificial intelligence algorithms that allow robots to navigate through unstructured environments. Biswas is involved in a project that studies how robots in close proximity with people in public interact , including on the campus of UT Austin, the university that declared this year to be the Year of AI . Other researchers who contributed to the paper were Hochul Hwang and Ivan Lee , of UMass Amherst; Hee Tae Jung of Indiana University; and Nicholas Giudice , of the University of Maine.

Photo credit: Jack Myer The University of Texas at Austin is creating one of the most powerful artificial intelligence hubs in the academic world to lead in research and offer world-class AI infrastructure to a wide range of partners. UT is launching the Center for Generative AI , powered by a new GPU computing cluster, among the largest in academia. The cluster will comprise 600 NVIDIA H100s GPUs \u2014 short for graphics processing units, specialized devices to enable rapid mathematical computations, making them ideal for training AI models. The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) will host and support the cluster, called Vista . \u201cArtificial intelligence is fundamentally changing our world, and this investment comes at the right time to help UT shape the future through our teaching and research,\u201d said President Jay Hartzell. \u201cWorld-class computing power combined with our breadth of AI research expertise will uniquely position UT to speed advances in health care, drug development, materials and other industries that could have a profound impact on people and society. We have designated 2024 as the Year of AI at UT, and a big reason why is the combination of the trends and opportunities across society, our talented people and strengths as a university, and now, our significant investment in the Center for Generative AI.\u201d The growth of ChatGPT and similar generative AI technologies has put pressure on many industry groups, health care organizations and public agencies to work with academic institutions to harness AI for innovation. Experts from the center will collaborate with external partners to develop and apply generative AI solutions to challenging problems across industries. With a core focus on biosciences, health care, computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), the new center will be housed within UT\u2019s interdisciplinary Machine Learning Laboratory and co-led by the Cockrell School of Engineering and the College of Natural Sciences. In recognition of AI\u2019s growth across industries, it also includes faculty members and support from Dell Medical School, as well as researchers from the School of Information and McCombs School of Business. \"We believe academia should continue to play a leading role in the development of AI,\u201d said Alex Dimakis, director of the center and professor in the Cockrell School\u2019s Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cOpen-source models, open data sets and interdisciplinary peer-reviewed research is the safest way to drive the upcoming AI revolution. Universities are uniquely suited to shape this ecosystem, and we are excited to be on the frontier of generative AI here in Austin.\" The University is currently home to the National Science Foundation-supported AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML) and TACC\u2019s Frontera, the most powerful supercomputer at a U.S. university. Center for Generative AI leaders envision applying fundamental algorithmic resources to solve large-scale applied problems, bridging academic and industrial goals for artificial intelligence. \u201cUT has established a tremendous foundation in AI,\u201d said Adam Klivans, a professor in the College of Natural Sciences\u2019 Department of Computer Science and director of the Machine Learning Laboratory. \u201cWith this investment, we can accelerate the process of scientific discovery and find new solutions to major engineering challenges that would otherwise take years of experimental work.\u201d The center offers a core pillar for advancing AI technologies while building on momentum generated in recent years. A year ago, UT announced a new online master\u2019s program in AI, the first large-scale degree program of its kind and the only master\u2019s degree program in AI from a top-ranked institution priced close to $10,000. In 2022, a leadership investment from alumnus Sanjay Chandra and his family created new research pathways for AI in the Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. And a $10 million gift from Dheeraj and Swapna Pandey launched a new partnership in computational oncology and machine learning. In 2020, the National Science Foundation selected UT to lead IFML. It is housed in the Machine Learning Laboratory, which was established that same year with a $5 million gift from alumni Amir and Zaib Husain. And in 2019, the University launched Good Systems, a cross-campus grand challenge initiative aimed at designing ethical AI technologies that benefit society.

    "text_content": "Undergraduate Researchers Help Unlock Lessons of Machine Learning and AI | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Undergraduate Researchers Help Unlock Lessons of Machine Learning and AI Posted by Staff Writer on Wednesday, March 20, 2024 UT College of Natural Sciences undergraduates Prasann Singhal, Nihita Sarma, Shankar Padmanabhan and Jennifer Mickel are conducting research into AI and its applications. From large language models to brain-machine interfaces, students work with faculty on cutting-edge research. Even before The University of Texas at Austin declared 2024 the Year of AI , artificial intelligence and machine learning had researchers across campus abuzz with activity. Undergraduates under the mentorship of professors in computer science and departments across campus are making their contributions in this fast-growing field. Humanizing Responses Image Prasann Singhal Prasann Singhal, linguistics and computer science junior, works under Greg Durrett, professor of computer science, to research the intersection of machine learning and human feedback. Using data and human preferences, Singhal\u2019s methods seek to tweak machine-learning models to create output more aligned with what a human would want or expect. This alignment attempts to learn appropriate functions in a semi-supervised way without explicit instruction, Singhal said. \u201cA question like, \u2018What are penguins?\u2019 might produce an output that gives a scientific explanation of how penguins live their lives,\u201d Singhal said. \u201cThat gets adjusted through technologies like ChatGPT to generate outputs that are more in line with what humans would expect and make them a little bit easier for the public to use.\u201d Knowing More Image Shankar Padmanabhan Mathematics senior Shankar Padmanabhan, researches another side of generative AI, model editing and continual learning, with computer science faculty member Eunsol Choi. \u201cLanguage models such as ChatGPT are usually trained on a fixed dataset (e.g, the internet before fall 2021),\u201d said Padmanabhan. \u201cAs a consequence, they lack knowledge of events happening after this cutoff. The field of continual learning attempts to determine the best way to edit the knowledge base of these models without affecting their knowledge of prior events.\u201d Padmanabhan\u2019s first paper discussed exploration of existing techniques, which he found were unable to make common-sense inferences. In a second paper, Padmanabhan found a method to fix discrepancies by placing a statement in context that outperformed prior models, he said. In December, Padmanabhan presented his research at the 2023 Neural Information Processing Systems conference, one of the biggest AI/machine learning conferences. Since then, Padmanabhan has been working on extending what he has learned to apply to information stored in languages other than English. \u201cIn particular, if we inject some information in English into a language model, ideally it should be stored in a language-agnostic manner such that the model can use it even when it isn\u2019t \u2018talking\u2019 in English,\u201d Padmabhan explained. Brain-Machine Interface Image Nihita Sarma AI also intersects with language in other research areas. Nihita Sarma, a computer science third-year student and member of Dean\u2019s Scholars and Turing Scholars, researches the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning to understand language in the brain, working with Alexander Huth, an assistant professor of computer science and neuroscience. As research subjects listen to podcasts, they lie in an MRI machine and readings track their brain activity. These customized-to-the-subject readings are then used to train machine learning models called encoding models, and Sarma then passes them through decoding models. \u201cMy research is taking those encodings and trying to backtrack and figure out based on this neural representation \u2014 based on the brain activity that was going on at that moment \u2014 what could the person inside the MRI machine possibly have been thinking or listening to at that moment?\u201d Sarma said. Along with gaining a better understanding of how language is represented in the brain, Sarma said the research has possible applications for a noninvasive communication tactic for people unable to speak or sign. \u201cWe would be able to decode what they\u2019re thinking or what they\u2019re trying to say, and allow them to communicate with the outside world,\u201d Sarma said. Towards Ethical AI Image Jennifer Mickel Inspired by the Netflix documentary \u201cCoded Bias\u201d about racial biases in facial recognition algorithms, Jennifer Mickel, a computer science fourth-year student, focuses her research on AI fairness. Biases in society are reflected within data, Mickel said, and a great deal of internet data represents a point of view centered on Western viewpoints. \u201cWe don\u2019t see as much representation from people who are not in the West, and so that means that the ideas of the people whose data we\u2019re using to train our models are replicated within those systems,\u201d Mickel said. Improving fairness can involve using data and assessing an AI model\u2019s performance in new and different ways. Much data is demographic-free due or has partial demographic information due to privacy or other barriers; nonetheless, many models perform better when given background information with demographics, Mickel said. That\u2019s why Mickel works to improve models trained with demographic-free data. Using a system of finding intersections in data \u2014 and identifying and mitigating the effects of the worst-performing group \u2014 proves feasible for improving these models. \u201cPractitioners would use our algorithm to find the groups and then they would retrain using that group information to improve the performance for the worst-performing group,\u201d Mickel said. \u201cThey would just keep doing that until the worst-performing group was performing as they had hoped.\u201d Early Starts Besides all studying AI, Singhal, Padmanabhan, Sarma and Mickel have something else in common: their undergraduate research exposure started within their first year and a half at UT. In fact, the University has more first- and second-year college students doing real-world research than any place in the country. Singhal said the early start afforded him the opportunity to learn his research interests and lead projects earlier in his research career. He also has formed strong connections with supportive lab members he\u2019s able to ask for advice or learn from. \u201cI\u2019m an NLP [natural language processing] researcher,\u201d Singhal said. \u201cI really love most of NLP. So it\u2019s always been very exciting, and it keeps me motivated to keep on doing research.\u201d Cross-posted from CNS News , by Amelia Engstrom News Categories Undergraduate Students Tags undergraduate research Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Data Neuroscience Mathematics",

    "text_content": "Transforming Video Accessibility Through Artificial Intelligence | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Transforming Video Accessibility Through Artificial Intelligence Posted by Trinity Erales on Thursday, June 27, 2024 Digital media is one of the best ways to engage with new communities, where each click takes you to new, engaging platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. This content is enhanced when you consider the intricacies of webcam visuals and overlays making it a really immersive experience. \u00a0Now, imagine this experience if you\u2019re unable to see the video. For people with visual impairments, accessing this content comes with many challenges. These platforms currently lack effective solutions to bridge the accessibility gap for the blind and low vision (BLV) community. This results in significant accessibility barriers, leaving BLV users unable to fully engage with the content that others can enjoy seamlessly. ShortScribe is an advanced technology that makes video content accessible by transforming visual elements into audio descriptions. The process begins by breaking down videos into discrete segments or \"shots,\" each representing a specific scene. Using vision language models like BLIP-2 and OCR (Optical Character Recognition), ShortScribe analyzes and interprets the visual information in each shot. It then employs GPT-4, a sophisticated large language model, to generate detailed textual descriptions of the visuals. These descriptions are provided in various levels of detail, allowing BLV users to either get a general overview or access more detailed descriptions based on their needs. This hierarchical approach to audio descriptions bridges the accessibility gap in digital media by enabling BLV users to understand and enjoy video content, providing them the flexibility to customize their viewing experience. The ShortScribe interfa ceconsists of (a) frontscreen video information including the short description, username, caption, and audio title, (b) video controls, (c) a button to open the description pane which includes the long description, on-screen text, and shot-by-shot descriptions,and (d) video statistics. Video Credit: TikTok used with permission from @nourished.by.mads. Working on these advancements, Dr. Amy Pavel , Tess Van Daele, Akhil Iyer, Jalyn C. Derry, and Mina Huh from UT Austin, along with Yuning Zhang from Cornell, underscore the growing need for accessible video content. As short-form videos gain popularity on social media, the impact of AI in addressing accessibility issues will become increasingly critical to ensure these platforms are accessible to everyone, including those with visual impairments. The ShortScribe system enhances the viewing experience for BLV users while also setting a precedent for how technology can be harnessed to overcome accessibility barriers in media consumption. This work not only contributes to the field of human-computer interaction and accessibility but also paves the way for further innovations in video accessibility. As we move forward, researchers, platform developers, and content creators are collaborating to improve accessibility as video content expands. These advancements help ensure the digital world is inclusive for everyone. News Categories Research Tags Amy Pavel Human-Computer Interaction Artificial Intelligence Year of AI Accessibility",

    "text_content": "NSF Funded Expedition Project Uses AI to Rethink Computer Operating Systems | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content NSF Funded Expedition Project Uses AI to Rethink Computer Operating Systems Posted by Staff Writer on Thursday, May 23, 2024 Research that will use artificial intelligence to boost the performance and energy efficiency of computer operating systems will be led by a team from The University of Texas at Austin, thanks to a major grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Expeditions in Computing program. Today\u2019s operating systems pose a significant barrier to a number of promised exciting innovations in computer hardware and applications \u2014 from personal assistant robots to autonomous vehicles to edge computing that could enable smart cities and less energy-intensive cloud computing. These operating systems often follow \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d rules for how hardware resources get allocated between different applications running simultaneously. The inflexibility of these rules makes it hard to integrate new advancements, resulting in poor performance and inefficient use, a problem the UT research team plans to tackle by leveraging AI. \u201cOur project will employ AI-aided intelligent resource management and auto-adapt as new applications and hardware emerge,\u201d said Aditya Akella , the Regents Chair in Computer Sciences #1 who is leading the project. \u201cThis will enable computing devices to be used at near-optimal efficiency while meeting the needs of arbitrary applications, and it will make computing infrastructure \u2018self-driving\u2019 by automating OS implementation and management.\u201d Akella said the project would extend beyond academics, bringing together not only computer scientists from UT, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but also industry partners from Amazon, Bosch, Cisco, Google, Microsoft and Broadcom. \u201cThese partners collectively develop and run operating systems for much of the world\u2019s computing infrastructure, and we will work with them to create the next-generation open-source intelligent and adaptive OS,\u201d Akella said. \u201cWe believe that the project offers a timely opportunity to fundamentally change the trajectory of computing.\u201d He added that the new style of OS could help autonomous robots become \u201cthe smartphones of the 2030s and beyond.\u201d \u201cThe smartphone revolution was enabled by new OS frameworks (for example, iOS and Android) that enabled users to run arbitrary third-party apps that have come to determine how they interact with technology and essential services,\u201d he said. \u201cLDOS can similarly usher in the era of affordable personal robots and apps that support our day-to-day activities and improve society for all, particularly for aging and disadvantaged populations.\u201d In addition to the research initiative, the project will create new undergraduate and graduate curricula with modules, courses and certificates exploring the interplay of computer systems and AI. The project\u2019s initiatives for broadening participation are designed to cultivate leadership among underrepresented groups in AI and prepare them for AI and computer systems technology and research careers. These initiatives seek to benefit hundreds to thousands of students each year. This project has a natural synergy with UT\u2019s Machine Learning Laboratory , where fundamental questions on new generative AI and machine learning techniques are being explored, and with the Center for Generative AI , which offers high-end GPU resources to train and evaluate new generative AI models. Co-principal investigators from UT\u2019s Department of Computer Science are Joydeep Biswas , Swarat Chaudhuri , Shuchi Chawla , I\u015f\u0131l Dillig , Daehyeok Kim , and Chris Rossbach . Co-PIs from UT\u2019s Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering are Alex Dimakis and Sanjay Shakkottai. The grant is for $12 million over five years, of which $9.3 million will come to UT. Expeditions awards represent some of the largest investments provided by the NSF\u2019s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.

Upcoming Talks 2024-2025 Friday, February 21, 2025, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Zoom Link Yoav Wald [homepage] Faculty Fellow, New York University Title: Robustness to Spurious Correlations: Lessons Learned on Causal Thinking and Large Scale Modelling Abstract: Predictive models often rely on spurious correlations, leading to unreliable performance. This talk covers a series of works on causally motivated methods to train models that are robust to spurious correlations. I will begin by outlining a formal framework for reasoning about spurious correlations and cover some core techniques to mitigate their effects. The talk will then explore three aspects of developing robust models: (i) considerations in training overparameterized models that maintain invariance to shifts in spurious correlations, (ii) approaches to dealing with scenarios where annotations of spuriously correlated features are unavailable, and (iii) the use of large language models and causal estimation techniques to enhance robustness in large-scale, real-world medical text classification tasks. About the speaker: Yoav Wald\u00a0is a Faculty Fellow/Assistant Professor at NYU's Center for Data Science, working on causality-motivated machine learning and causal inference. He applies these tools to problems in robust prediction and decision support in healthcare.

Past Talks 2024-2025 Friday, September 13, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording Robert Platt [homepage] Associate Professor, Northeastern University Title: Symmetric Policy Learning in Robotics Abstract: Many robotics problems have transition dynamics that are symmetric in SE(2) and SE(3) with respect to rotation, translation, scaling, reflection, etc. In these situations, any optimal policy will also be symmetric over these transformations. In this talk, I leverage this insight to improve the data efficiency of policy learning by encoding domain symmetries directly into the neural network model using group invariant and equivariant layers. The result is that we can learn non-trivial visuomotor control policies with much less data than is typically the case. For imitation learning, this significantly reduces the number of demonstrations required. For reinforcement learning, it reduces the amount of experience needed to learn a good policy. In fact, we can sometimes learn good policies from scratch training directly on physical robotic hardware in real time. About the speaker: Rob Platt is an Associate Professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University and a Faculty Fellow at BDAII. He is interested in developing robots that can perform complex manipulation tasks alongside humans in the uncertain everyday world.

Prior to coming to Northeastern, he was a Research Scientist at MIT and a technical lead at NASA Johnson Space Center. Friday, September 20, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording Daniel Fried [homepage] Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University Title: Planning and Inferring With LLMs for Grounded, Interactive Tasks Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in language-based interfaces for tasks that require interacting with people and with the (digital) world: for example asking questions of a user to help them interactively retrieve information, or carrying\u00a0out everyday tasks in a web browser. These settings involve uncertainty and partial observability,\u00a0and so afford planning and inference methods inspired by classical AI approaches. We present techniques for layering structured search and inference procedures on top of LLM-based agentive systems --- making the LLMs better able to interact with their environments and human partners. First, we investigate visually grounded reference games, where a system and a person must use dialogue to collaboratively identify and build common ground. Here, modeling uncertainty about the user's intent and asking maximally-informative questions improves task success. Second, we investigate language-based tasks on the web, where a system must carry out instructions from a person by taking actions in the browser. Here, performing tree search to plan over possible trajectories in the environments substantially improves performance of state-of-the-art models. About the speaker: Daniel Fried is an assistant professor in the Language Technologies Institute at CMU, and a research scientist at Meta AI. His research\u00a0focuses on language grounding, interaction, and applied pragmatics, with a particular focus on\u00a0language\u00a0interfaces such as grounded instruction following and code generation. Previously, he was a postdoc at Meta AI and the University of Washington and completed a PhD at UC Berkeley. His research has been supported by an Okawa Research Award, a Google PhD Fellowship and a Churchill Fellowship Friday, September 27, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 4.304 | Recording Bo Liu [homepage] Ph.D. Student & Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas at Austin Title: Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners Abstract: The most fundamental capability of modern AI methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability to predict the next token in a long sequence of tokens, known as ``sequence modeling.\" Although the Transformers model is the current dominant approach to sequence modeling, its quadratic computational cost with respect to sequence length is a significant drawback. State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks. About the speaker: Bo is a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Prof. Peter Stone and Prof. Qiang Liu . His research lies in multitask/continual learning and reinforcement learning. Recently, he is working on designing theoretically sound algorithms/neural architectures for training large-scale multi-purpose agents. Friday, October 11, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording Co-Hosted with Dr. Joydeep Biswas's AMRL Lab Jason Liu [homepage] Ph.D. Candidate, Brown University Title: Robotic Language Grounding Abstract: Natural language provides an intuitive and flexible way for humans to communicate with robots. However, understanding diverse, ambiguous language commands is challenging. Grounding language to structured task specifications enables autonomous robots to understand a broad range of natural language and solve long-horizon tasks with safety guarantees. Linear temporal logic (LTL) provides unambiguous semantics for language grounding, and its compositionality can induce skill transfer. In this talk, I will first propose two language grounding systems. 1) Lang2LTL is a modular system that uses large language models (LLMs) to ground navigation commands with diverse temporal patterns to LTL task specifications in novel environments without retraining. 2) Improved upon its predecessor, Lang2LTL-2 uses LLMs and a pretrained vision-language model to ground spatiotemporal navigation commands. By translating language to LTL, both systems can detect infeasible task specifications and abort execution when necessary. 3) Next, I will introduce LTL-Transfer, a zero-shot transfer algorithm that leverages the compositionality of LTL to reuse learned skills to solve novel tasks without violating any safety constraints. Future work aims at developing robotic systems that produce robust and verifiable behavior by using multimodal grounding and human-robot dialog.

Friday, October 18, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording Leqi Liu [homepage] Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin Title: Preference Optimization in Large Language Model Alignment: Personalization, Common Pitfalls and Beyond Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant method for aligning large language models (LLMs) to be more helpful and less harmful. In this talk, we address two core limitations of traditional RLHF. First, it assumes that all human preferences come from the same distribution, preventing fine-tuned LLMs from generating personalized content without explicit prompting. We introduce Personalized RLHF, an efficient framework that captures individual preferences through a lightweight user model, enabling LLMs to generate content that reflects diverse and potentially conflicting user preferences. Second, current RLHF methods often rely on optimizing against margin-based losses, which focus on the difference between preferred and dispreferred responses but fail to specify ideal LLM behavior on each type of the responses individually. This underspecification can lead to problematic training dynamics, increasing the probability of generating unsafe content or reducing the probability of generating ideal responses. We characterize when these problematic dynamics emerge and outline algorithms that can mitigate these issues. Finally, we will discuss future directions and potential new paradigms for improving LLM alignment. About the speaker: Leqi Liu is an assistant professor in use-inspired AI at the department of information, risk and operations management at UT Austin. Her research focuses on (1) investigating the foundations of state-of-the-art machine intelligence, with a particular focus on generative AI systems; (2) designing principled algorithmic frameworks for human-centered machine learning that model human preferences and behaviors, integrating these models into machine learning pipelines for applications such as healthcare, recommender systems, and education; and (3) evaluating and auditing the societal impacts of large-scale AI systems, including large language models and recommender systems.

Friday, October 25, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording He He [homepage] Assistant Professor, New York University Title: Tracing LLM Capabilities to the Training Data Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable emergent capabilities. However, the origins of these capabilities remain poorly understood. What kind of patterns in pre-training data enable LLMs to perform ICL? Can LLMs infer causal relations from relational data in text, or are they limited to memorizing explicit causal facts? We explore these questions and discuss the broader implications for understanding how LLMs generalize from training data to perform complex tasks and where their reasoning capabilities face limitations. About the speaker: He He is an Assistant Professor\u00a0of\u00a0Computer Science and Center for Data Science at New York\u00a0University.

Friday, November 1, 2024, 11:00 AM, GDC 6.302 | Recording Gopala Anumanchipalli [homepage] Assistant Professor, University of California Berkeley Title: Grounding Speech AI models in Human Speech Mechanisms Abstract: In this talk I will go over our recent attempts to induce human mechanisms in Spoken language AI applications. I will first go over the neural and physiological\u00a0basis of fluent speech production, and talk about grounding current Self-Supervised Speech models (Hubert, WavLM etc) in human processes. Specifically, I will talk about probing articulatory information in these models. I will then present a new coding scheme called SPARC (SPeech ARticulatory Coding), that completely describes speech in terms of speech articulation, and discuss the universality of such a coding scheme across speakers and languages. I will also detail newer experiments in inducing higher order phonological structure\u00a0into these models. As a practical demonstration of these developments, I will talk about some experiments in Neurotechnologies, specifically Brain-Computer\u00a0Interfaces that use some of these\u00a0results. Time permitting, I will briefly talk about our recent work in Dysfluent speech modeling characterization in speech disorders, exemplar based speech stylization etc. About the speaker: Gopala Anumachipalli is the Robert E.

    "text_content": "Building Industry Bridges: Computer Scientist Peter Stone Tackles New Role for Sony, While Leading at UT | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Building Industry Bridges: Computer Scientist Peter Stone Tackles New Role for Sony, While Leading at UT Posted by Marc Airhart on Tuesday, July 30, 2024 Update: After being appointed to lead Sony AI in 2019, UT Austin computer science professor Peter Stone has now been promoted to chief scientist and deputy president at Sony AI . The new role will involve guiding key projects and researchers, as well as shaping technical direction and project goal-setting in the organization. We are again sharing our story about Stone and his work with Sony AI in light of this news. In a sign of the highly competitive environment for top talent in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the Sony Corporation tapped Peter Stone, a faculty member in the College of Natural Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, to lead Sony AI in the United States . Stone, Truchard Foundation Chair in Natural Sciences, will continue to teach and direct Texas Robotics and the Learning Agents Research Group in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at UT Austin, in addition to his role at Sony AI\u2019s U.S. division. Stone oversees an inter-college consortium of robotics groups across campus whose external partners include the Austin-based Army Futures Command (AFC). As the demand for technologies using artificial intelligence booms, giants of industry and the public sector, from Google and Facebook to AFC, are increasingly turning to university researchers for their unique expertise. \u201cThe mark of a top-tier university in artificial intelligence is whether you have this kind of connection to industry,\u201d said Don Fussell, chair of the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. \u201cIn this field, it is only the leading R1 universities whose faculty are asked to run industry research labs.\u201d \u201cThe University of Texas remains my home base, and I am excited both to assume this new role and continue the research and teaching I do at UT,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAlthough the new lab does not have a campus affiliation, there is no doubt that the opportunities the university affords have a lot to do with why Sony\u2019s AI research hub for the United States is now led by someone right here in Austin.\u201d Stone is not alone in bridging academia and industry. Inderjit Dhillon , a professor of computer science and director of the Center for Big Data Analytics at UT Austin, has worked in the Amazon Research Lab in Berkeley, California, developing and deploying state-of-the-art machine-learning methods for Amazon Search. Other UT faculty continue to work with members of the university community while assuming roles in industry; for example, Kristen Grauman , a professor of computer science at UT Austin who specializes in computer vision and and machine learning, has worked with Facebook AI Research. Universities and industry both see dual appointments as a way to mitigate a possible danger to the core missions of both. If industry recruits top researchers from academic posts, it makes it harder for the next generation of researchers to receive an education and learn the craft from the field\u2019s leaders. This is essentially \u201ceating their seed corn,\u201d as Fussell explained to The New York Times . For four years, Stone served as president and co-founder of an AI startup. His prior work in industry included a stint as a senior technical staff member in the AI principles research department at AT&T Labs \u2013 Research soon after he completed his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University. Stone\u2019s research interests include planning, machine learning, multiagent systems, robotics, and machine learning, especially reinforcement learning. He has previously served as the president of the international RoboCup Federation, as senior vice president of Sony Corporation of America, and as a recipient of numerous research and teaching awards. He has been named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow, Guggenheim Fellow, AAAI Fellow, IEEE Fellow, AAAS Fellow, and University Distinguished Teaching Professor Cross-posted from CNS News .

Moreover, AI workloads require advanced network monitoring capabilities to quickly diagnose and resolve performance bottlenecks. To make life easier for network architects and developers, a research team led by UT Austin computer science faculty members Daehyeok Kim , Aditya Akella , and Venkat Arun is launching a project to develop a new framework called Transcraft that makes the process of designing and implementing new network stacks simpler and more adaptable. Their work promises to streamline how networks manage the growing complexity of AI model training and application, setting the stage for significant advancements in both fields. \u201cDesigning and implementing network transport stacks is a slow, complex process, complicated by the vast design space, challenges in refining transport algorithms, and the intricacies of validating and optimizing performance,\u201d said Daehyeok Kim, an assistant professor of computer science who is leading the project. \u201cOur project aims to realize Transcraft by addressing key questions in computer networking, systems, and formal methods.\u201d The implications for both academic research and real-world AI applications are enormous, particularly as network infrastructures struggle to keep pace with the increasing demands of large-scale AI. This high-impact research has been awarded a $1.08 million NSF Medium grant over the next four years, recognizing the critical role it could play in advancing network and AI systems on a national scale.

Their publication, titled Going Beyond the Limits of SFI: Flexible and Secure Hardware-Assisted In-Process Isolation with HFI , presents HFI, a new extension for in-process isolation to current processors. Many applications such as browsers use isolation mechanisms in a variety of places, for example, to ensure attackers cannot target bugs in third-party libraries to compromise the browser . Hardware support for isolation would increase security and reduce runtime overheads of enforcing isolation in applications. HFI supports isolation by making small changes to existing processors to support direct isolation of native code, as well as to speed up existing software-based fault isolation/sandboxing systems. \u201cHFI provides a simple and clean specification for CPUs to support isolation for application components. If CPUs adopt this extension, this would be a great opportunity to drive the security of the entire software ecosystem forward; HFI encourages developers to develop modular applications where bugs in one part of an application do not automatically translate into a bug in the entire application\u201d The Intel Hardware Security Academic Award is awarded to recognize advancements in \u201csolutions, tools, and methodologies, which enhance the industry\u2019s ability to deliver more secure and trustworthy foundational technologies,\u201d according to the award\u2019s website . The company typically awards only three published papers each year. The award is not the first achievement for the publication. Researchers previously won a distinguished paper award at an ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems conference held in Fall 2023.

Three years later, he published a paper introducing a new architecture for textless voice conversion. The model aims to convert a phrase from one person's voice to another just by listening. Baade is now finalizing another paper and working on a fourth. Computer Science and Mathematics senior Alan Baade really enjoys spending hours on problems. Especially the particularly hard ones, he said. Spending 40 hours on one equation with a small break for sleep somewhere in the middle is rewarding to him. \u201cI think it's because you can tell at the end of this you are going to understand the material,\u201d Baade said. \u00a0\u201cYou're going to understand computers.\u201d After completing a UT high school internship research program, Baade came to UT Austin without knowing exactly what he wanted to focus on. Talking to other students in the Turing Scholars Honors program helped him find a place in undergraduate research, cultivating his central interest in machine learning. As a Turing Scholar in the Department of Computer Science, students have the chance for closer peer-to-peer relationships and access to advanced academic opportunities. This includes taking specialty honors classes with 30-60 students, access to professors and staff within the department, and the option to live in Honors housing with other Turing scholars and students from various other honors programs. \u201cWe take really talented and motivated students from around the country, around the world, and we put them in an environment where we give them lots of opportunities and challenges,\u201d said Calvin Lin, Distinguished Teaching professor in Computer Science and Director of the Turing Honor Scholars program. \u201cThey sort of work together and support each other and inspire each other and hopefully do great things.\u201d Baade received his first undergraduate research opportunity after cold-emailing a professor on the advice of a Sophomore Turing Scholar one night during his freshman year. Three years later, Baade published his second official research paper in July, currently finalizing another and actively working on a fourth. \u201cI was not planning on doing a PhD whatsoever until at least well after the first semester freshman year,\u201d Baade said. Baade is credited as the primary author of a July research paper titled Neural Codec Language Models for Disentangled and Textless Voice Conversion . From UT\u2019s Speech, Audio, and Language Technologies lab, the paper presents a new architecture for textless voice conversion by introducing a new type of semantic unit to a modified version of Microsoft\u2019s Vall-E, a text-to-speech model. The paper\u2019s model would be able to convert a phrase said by one person to another person\u2019s voice just by listening. According to Puyuan Peng, a fourth-year graduate student and co-author of the paper, Baade was the primary researcher testing each possible structure and working on its various components. The models introduced in the paper could replicate speech without using text. \u201cThe Microsoft model came out in January of 2023 and it's a (text-to-speech) model. It's very powerful, but the problem is, there are about 7000 languages in the world, and more than half of them don't have a (written) form,\u201d Peng said. \u201cWhich means even if this model is super powerful, it cannot be applied to more than half of the languages in the world.\u201d Earlier tested models took about eight days to train and were mixed and matched with each other for each system. Around eight models were finalized for the paper, each taking about four days to train using two graphic processing units. It was like putting together a puzzle, Baade said. \u201cAs an undergrad, you have a lot of responsibilities (like) classes and things like that, and to be able to balance an independent research project on top of all of that, and not just make progress, but to actually push it all the way to completion, and write it up into a paper and submit it into a top international conference in the field, and get it accepted and travel there and present it to an audience, is pretty impressive to say the least,\u201d said David Harwath, assistant computer science professor and the paper\u2019s third co-author. The paper\u2019s co-authors hope the architecture, with increased computing power, will be able to convert in languages without a text form. Harwath, who is also principle investigator at the Speech, Audio, and Language Technologies lab , said applications could be in creative spheres, legal industries and even allowing people who previously lost their voice a chance to get it back. \u201c(AI)\u2019s an incredibly fast-moving field right now, and which makes it very exciting to work in,\u201d Harwath said. \u201cWe're continuing to do work in this lab to make these models more capable and more generalizable to other languages and with a wider array of applications.\u201d Turing scholars can excel in many ways, Lin said, either through research, in school work, or past graduation. Seeing students like Baade exemplifies the purpose of the Turing Program, he said. \u201cIn some ways, what we're doing is we're challenging and hopefully inspiring students to set the standards high, to maybe do things that they hadn't even thought of,\u201d Lin said.

On Thu, Sep 19, 2024, the UT Programming Team competed at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) 2023-24 48th World Finals hosted by the Kazakhstan Competitive Programming Federation in Astana, Kazakhstan . The competition consisted of teams from 124 regions (approx. 372 students) trying to solve 12 problems in 5 hrs. The first-place team, Peking University, solved 9 problems. UT solved 3 problems and came in 109th out of 141, 15th place in North America. Teams consist of three students. The students on the UTPC team were Aaryan Prakash ('25, B.S.), Caleb Hu ('25, B.S.), and Mark Wen ('25, B.S.). The coach was Trung Dang (current Ph.D.), and the faculty advisors were Prof. Etienne Vouga and Prof. Glenn Downing . UT has been competing since 1997. UT went to the 2016-17 41st World Finals in South Dakota, the 2017-18 42nd World Finals in Beijing, China, the 2018-19 43rd World Finals in Porto, Portugal, the 2019-20 44th World Finals in Moscow, Russia (online), and the 2021-22 46th World Finals in Luxor, Egypt. UT has seen marked improvement since creating a new elective, CS104c: Competitive Programming in 2014, taught by Prof. Vouga and Prof. Downing and the student officers of the UT Programming Club. The ICPC traced its roots to 1970 when pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society hosted the first competition. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to increase students' ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities in computing. Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition, with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the tournament has expanded into a worldwide collaboration of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship, the ICPC World Finals. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world's universities. The ICPC is part of the ICPC Foundation . The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure.

    "text_content": "Remembering Turing Award Winner E. Allen Emerson | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Remembering Turing Award Winner E. Allen Emerson Posted by Staff Writer on Monday, October 21, 2024 UT Computer Science mourns the loss of Professor Emeritus E. Allen Emerson, winner of the most prestigious award in computer science and a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin since the early 1980s, who died on October 15 after an extended illness. \"I'm very sad to learn of Allen's death, he was a good friend and a great scientist,\u201d said Don Fussell, Chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201cHis work was a huge step forward in the development of tools that help designers create systems with known, verifiable properties.\" Along with Edmund M. Clarke and Joseph Sifakis,\u00a0Emerson was awarded the 2007 A.M. Turing Award by the Association for Computing Machinery, the highest honor in computer science, for research in an automatic verification technique known as Model Checking. Their innovations transformed this approach from a theoretical technique to a highly effective verification technology that enables computer hardware and software engineers to find errors efficiently in complex system designs. This transformation resulted in increased assurance that the systems perform as intended by the designers, using a fully automated approach that is now the most widely used verification method in the hardware and software industries. \u201cWithout tools like these, we're simply out of our depth designing systems of the complexity of today's computing systems, or indeed other types of systems of similar complexity,\u201d says Fussell. \u201cOn top of this impact, the quality of his work represents the high standard of excellence our faculty expect from ourselves at our best. He will be sorely missed.\u201d Model Checking as a standard procedure for quality assurance has enabled designers and manufacturers to address verification problems that span both hardware and software. It has also helped them to gain mathematical confidence that complex computer systems meet their specifications, and it has provided added security for a range of both common and critical computing applications. Many major hardware and software companies now rely heavily on Model Checking. Common examples include verification of the designs for integrated circuits such as microprocessors, as well as communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems and security algorithms. Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Emerson had an early interest in scientific and mathematical topics. He taught himself calculus several years before he took it in public school. He took a course on computer programming in high school, where he learned the BASIC programming language. Subsequently, he taught himself Fortran and Algol, running programs on a mainframe computer. Emerson received a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin, and a doctoral degree in applied mathematics from Harvard University before joining the Computer Science department at UT as an assistant professor in 1981. He spent his academic career at UTCS, retiring in 2016 as Regents Chair Emeritus. In addition to the Turing Award, Emerson was co-recipient of the 1998 Paris Kanellakis Award for Theory and Practice from the ACM, the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence from Carnegie Mellon University and the 2006 Test-of-Time Award from the IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) for his research on efficient Model Checking.

I've gotten to learn a lot through my classes, but also through hackathons and organizations like DiRP. Additionally, I've made some really close friends in this department who have been a part of my journey in CS thus far. I was also a pod mentor last school year, and I had a really good time welcoming the new freshmen into UTCS. I've had a lot of great experiences in UTCS, and I'm really grateful for them. What advice (if any) would you go back and give yourself coming into UTCS? I would probably advise myself to get more involved in organizations, especially freshman year. I found it hard to balance being in clubs while doing schoolwork, but I think I should have tried to do that better since getting involved in clubs can give you really good experience in skills that you may not be able to develop just from your classes.",

    "text_content": "Turbocharging Protein Engineering with AI | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content Turbocharging Protein Engineering with AI Posted by Marc Airhart and Anita Shiva on Wednesday, September 25, 2024 Biotech advances from UT\u2019s new Deep Proteins group are changing the game with help from artificial intelligence. Working as a chemist in Houston, Danny Diaz spent a lot of time plodding his way through crosstown traffic, pondering how to speed up his research. \u201cI realized that my impact in the short term would be limited to the amount of chemistry experiments I could do with my hands,\u201d he recalled. It occurred to him that with software engineering and data analytics, he could run virtual experiments any time, even while he slept or was traveling. And the results could help him bypass some of the trial and error that\u2019s common in the lab. When he took this mindset with him into a chemistry graduate program at The University of Texas at Austin, he arrived at a starting line of sorts along with other researchers around the world who were just beginning to develop ambitious new approaches to designing proteins for a host of useful applications ranging from therapeutics to agrochemicals to food additives to enzymes that break down plastic waste. Among the most promising applications for protein engineering are therapeutics to treat diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, rare metabolic disorders, Alzheimer\u2019s, infectious diseases and more. Because the traditional way of developing proteins into therapeutics is slow, expensive and riddled with failure, it was a field primed for disruption. In 2020, when Diaz was a second-year Ph.D. student, Google\u2019s DeepMind team released the second version of AlphaFold , a powerful artificial intelligence tool for predicting what three-dimensional shape any given protein would take, based on its sequence of amino acids. Predicting these protein shapes, called structures, had been a grand challenge in biology for decades and, although the model\u2019s predictions weren\u2019t perfect, further refinements have brought it so close that the problem is now considered more or less solved. The key to AlphaFold\u2019s success is a new paradigm for building AI models, called the transformer architecture, which is also the foundation of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. While most folks know it as a way to generate useful text, researchers in biology and chemistry quickly realized that transformer models could also be applied to designing protein-based biotechnologies. AlphaFold has enabled many of Diaz\u2019s research projects, where he uses it to train AI models with protein structures where experimental data doesn\u2019t exist.

Planning for Proteins You might recall from high school biology that proteins are made up of amino acids strung together like beads on a necklace. The exact order of the amino acids, or the protein sequence, determines the 3D shape it will take and how it will function. However, there are more potential variations of protein sequences than stars in the universe, with most of these variations being unstable or non-functional. This makes testing them in the lab to find improved, highly functional proteins extremely arduous. To make a protein useful for applications in health and medicine often requires introducing variations, via genetic engineering, so that a protein can be used in a vaccine, as a cancer drug or to biomanufacture goods. Identifying mutations that optimize proteins is difficult, also, because it traditionally relies on scientists leveraging scarce data in the scientific literature related to any specific protein to guide their intuition. Enter artificial intelligence. The dream is that AI models can learn from a wide range of data sources and then guide researchers to better designs faster. Professor Andrew Ellington in the Department of Molecular Biosciences, for example, enlisted Diaz early on in a project to explore leveraging machine learning to speed up the painstaking process of protein engineering. That project, known as MutCompute , was an early example of how AI can narrow the search space to tweak proteins and make them more stable, easier to produce or more accurate at hitting targets. The resulting AI model helped enable a breakthrough in plastic-eating enzymes . Fast forward to today, and Diaz, now a research scientist in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, co-leads the Deep Proteins group, a team based in UT Austin\u2019s Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML), which is funded by the National Science Foundation. Alongside the IFML director and Deep Proteins co-leader Adam Klivans , Diaz and other researchers collaborate with experimental scientists who produce and test AI-designed proteins in labs across UT as well as at partner institutions, including Houston Methodist Research Institute, the University of Minnesota and Cornell University. \u201cOne of the things that makes UT special in this space is that we connect world-class AI researchers with world-class scientists in biochemistry to accelerate biotechnology development, all under one roof,\u201d Klivans said. \u201cDeep Proteins, which develops foundational protein AI tools with an eye towards real-world applications, was designed to be interdisciplinary from the start.\u201d Deep Proteins researchers draw on lessons from many disciplines, for example, to develop an AI technique called EvoRank that trains an AI model to learn from nature\u2019s track record of protein evolution in order to predict evolutionarily plausible novel mutations. Diaz realized that even if he didn\u2019t have high quality mutational data from experiments in the lab, he could observe the diversity of proteins produced by nature. \u201cWe wondered, can we learn the underlying rules nature used to produce this diversity?\u201d he said. \u201cOnce these rules are learned by an AI model, we will be able to filter out mutations that kill proteins on the computer so we can focus on those that don\u2019t in the lab, thus accelerating our ability to develop new protein-based biotechnologies.\u201d Image The three dimensional structure of an enzyme originally derived from plants and used as an Alzheimer's drug that has been re-engineered to produce at higher yields and have higher catalytic activity. Protein Superpowers To make commercially viable drugs, one of the superpowers researchers need to endow proteins with is the ability to be produced in high quantities, quickly and affordably. Working with professors Andrew Ellington, Jessie Zhang and others, Deep Proteins researchers used an AI model to do just that for an Alzheimer\u2019s drug that is traditionally derived from daffodils, a costly and time-consuming process that is vulnerable to fickle growing conditions. They updated the model they had used earlier for the plastic-eating enzyme, extending it to the regions in proteins that interact with small molecules and vitamins. \u201cProteins do not exist in isolation,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThey exist in a soup mixed with other proteins, RNA, DNA, vitamins, minerals, fats, sugars and other small molecules. Therefore, it\u2019s critical that the AI is trained to understand not just protein chemistry but all of biochemistry.\u201d Guided by this updated AI model, MutComputeX , they engineered E. coli bacteria to produce a precursor to the Alzheimer\u2019s drug galantamine , allowing it to be grown in a lab more cheaply and reliably. Boosting yield is also a key goal in a collaboration between the Deep Proteins group and research associate professor Everett Stone\u2019s lab. That effort is seeking a treatment for a form of breast cancer that is highly dependent on a key metabolite called serine. Starting with a human enzyme that naturally breaks down serine, the researchers used their AI models to develop a more stable version that has seven times higher yield than the natural version. This version, which they\u2019ve filed a patent for, is now in animal trials. Another useful superpower is for a protein to bind more tightly to a target, a feature known as binding affinity. This generally means it will be more effective at a given task, such as when an antibody binds to a protein on the surface of a virus and prevents it from infecting cells. In a collaboration with Jimmy Gollihar at Houston Methodist Research Institute, Diaz used MutComputeX to dramatically increase the binding affinity of two antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. Yet another protein superpower that\u2019s especially useful for vaccines is stability, the knack for keeping its shape in the face of temperature or chemical changes experienced during the manufacturing and shipping process and once injected into your body. Some viruses have proteins on their surfaces that allow them to infect cells and that are good at evading the immune system because they change shape. To generate the best immune response, vaccines based on these viral proteins have to lock them in the shape they typically take before infecting a cell. That was the key advance made by UT Austin professor of molecular biosciences Jason McLellan for the COVID-19 vaccines and RSV vaccines . McLellan\u2019s lab is now working with the Deep Proteins group to explore how AI might help speed up the design process for future vaccines for other viruses, including as a part of a major new multi-million-dollar project led by La Jolla Institute for Immunology . \u201cWe would normally spend a lot of time manually staring at structures, identifying amino acid substitutions, and maybe our hit rate wasn\u2019t particularly high, like we\u2019d have to try 100 substitutions to find 20 that worked,\u201d said McLellan, one of the world\u2019s leading vaccine innovators. \u201cI think with machine learning, it\u2019s going to have a higher hit rate eventually. Maybe we\u2019ll get the same 20 substitutions, but only have to test 40.\u201d Image A researcher in the lab of structural biologist and vaccine designer Jason McLellan. Credit: Vivian Abagiu. Predicting Stabilizing Mutations Before developing the evolution-inspired technique EvoRank, Diaz, Klivans and Jeffrey Ouyang Zhang, a fourth-year computer science doctoral student, used their combined expertise to develop one particularly elegant algorithm, Mutate Everything . Starting from either AlphaFold or ESM, another AI model that predicts a protein\u2019s structure based on its amino acid sequence, Mutate Everything can predict protein stability for single and higher-order mutations, with the aim of significantly accelerating research and development of protein-based biotechnologies. Building off their framework, Stability Oracle, which was recently described in a Nature Communications paper , the AI worked to identify and recommend single mutations for protein stabilization. Mutate Everything will be retrained and updated as more protein experimental data becomes available, which makes the model important for applications in industries that rely on biotechnology, such as in the development of life-saving medications. The research team has made the algorithm publicly available to increase translation to industry use. \u201cOur computational tools can tell them how to stabilize a protein, which can save them a lot of time, headache and money,\u201d Ouyang-Zhang said. Still, AI researchers also must cope with having only limited experimental data on the properties of proteins to adequately train AI models to understand how proteins work and thus how to engineer them to work differently. That\u2019s why newer efforts, like the Deep Proteins group\u2019s work to learn from natural evolution via EvoRank, can complement the models that are based on experimental data. Diaz is now working to launch a biotech startup company focused on inventing novel AI-inspired proteins to address obesity, diabetes and cancer. \u201cNearly half of Americans are prediabetic or diabetic, and about as many will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cHealthcare spending is currently outpacing GDP growth and currently nearly 20% of GDP. If we continue, these healthcare costs will decimate our country and put significant financial burdens on future generations. AI-engineered proteins can be the superheroes we need.\u201d Six years ago, when Diaz was getting started, the field of AI-guided protein engineering was brand new. Now the Deep Proteins team is among the most established and respected players in this space at a university anywhere. They also have a track record of AI-designed proteins to point to, with models that more traditional labs increasingly can benefit from. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to discover new things in established fields,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cWith AI for protein engineering, there are lots of opportunities to do really cool, innovative work and that can change the world.\u201d Tags Molecular Biosciences Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Year of AI Adam Klivans Daniel Diaz",

    "text_content": "In Robot Soccer and More, UT Students Best the Competition in Eindhoven | Department of Computer Science Skip to main content In Robot Soccer and More, UT Students Best the Competition in Eindhoven Posted by Christine Sinatra on Wednesday, July 24, 2024 Among hundreds of teams from around the world competing at RoboCup 2024, UT researchers and their robots shine. Student researchers from the University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science are returning to the Forty Acres triumphant after beating the competition at RoboCup 2024 with a team of winning autonomous robots. The international scientific competition attracted an estimated 2,500 artificial intelligence and robotics researchers from more than four dozen countries. RoboCup seeks to \u201cadvance the state of the art of intelligent robots\u201d that will be needed to help meet a wide range of societal challenges. At each year\u2019s event, research teams compete at everything from robotic soccer matches to challenges based on domestic tasks for robots. This year\u2019s victories coincide with UT\u2019s year-long Year of AI initiative. Over the years, Texas Robotics director and computer science professor Peter Stone has mentored many championship-winning teams across categories. This year, he and the UT students teamed up with a UT computer science alum and current University of Wisconsin Professor Josiah Hanna and his students to form WisTex United. At this year\u2019s RoboCup, held in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, the team competed in the humanoid robot soccer competition known as the Standard Platform League. In this category, all teams use the same robots, which are then programmed to compete together as a team and without human intervention. This means the robots have to be able to navigate decisions on the soccer field, move the ball down the field, visually recognize their own team\u2019s players and other objects and effectively beat an opposing team programmed separately for the same challenges.

The team consisted of UT Austin Ph.D. students Zhihan Wang and Siddhant Aggarwal and recent master\u2019s degree alumni Josh Kelle and Geethika Hemkumar. After securing an exciting come-from-behind victory in the second half of a match against a team from Universidad de la Sabana in Columbia, WisTex shut out the competition in the finals , against a team from Germany\u2019s University of Applied Scientists. With that 7-0 win in the \u201cChallenge Shield\u201d (lower division) category, the team brought home a first-place trophy. \u201cThis year, we chose to compete in the lower division because we were forming a new collaborative team and didn't know how well it would work, but we intend to compete in the upper division next year,\u201d said Stone, who has been involved in RoboCup competitions since the program\u2019s inception nearly three decades ago. Another competition, RoboCup@Home, focuses on honing the skills of autonomous service robots by having robots listen to verbal requests, then plan and execute on those requests in a setting that is new to them. UT computer science Ph.D. student Yuqian Jiang led the effort, joined by mechanical engineering graduate student Chang Shi and volunteer and aerospace engineering alum Steven Patrick. Progressing in multiple rounds of the competition, Jiang\u2019s entry responded to general-purpose service requests, such as \u201cFetch a drink from the shelf and place it on the TV table.\u201d It also correctly identified answers to questions in a dynamic environment. Jiang was awarded RoboCup\u2019s Silvia Coradeschi award in recognition of her distinguished research accomplishments. \u201cAll of the students worked very hard leading up to this event,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of them.\u201d Image YuqianJiang won RoboCup's Silvia Coradeschi Award in recognition of her distinguished research accomplishments in RoboCup@Home.
