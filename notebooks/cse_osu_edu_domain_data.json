Thu, Apr 3 2014, 4pm Dreese Labs 480 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Mar 17 2014, 2:45pm Yinqian Zhang PhD Candidate University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Talk Abstract: This talk covers a series of studies on the security threats and defenses in multi-tenant public clouds. In particular, it details the work on cache-based side-channel attacks that can successfully extract cryptographic private keys from another VM co-located on the same physical machine, which calls into question the established belief that the security isolation provided by modern virtualization technologies remains adequate under the new threat model in multi-tenant public clouds. To address such threats, two defensive techniques were devised, which can be adopted by cloud tenants immediately on modern cloud platforms without extra help from the providers: (1) for tenants requiring a high degree of security and physical isolation, a tool to facilitate cloud auditing of such isolation without querying the cloud provider; and (2) for tenants who use multi-tenant cloud services, an operating-system-level defense for the tenants to defend against side-channel threats on their own. About the Speaker: Yinqian Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by Professor Michael Reiter. Yinqian's research focuses on computer systems and security, with particular emphasis on the security of virtualized and distributed systems. His work on side-channel analysis in the clouds was widely discussed in popular technology news websites. The work he conducted as a research intern at RSA labs and Google Research resulted in several U.S. pending patents. He is also the recipient of the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Computer Security in 2013.

The need to perform computation on this data to extract meaningful information has become ubiquitous. The following fundamental questions arise in this setting: Can the cloud compute on the encrypted data of multiple users without knowing their secret keys? What functions can be computed in this manner? What if the users are mutually distrustful? My research provides the first positive resolution of these questions. In this talk I will describe these new results and my other interests.

Thu, Mar 20 2014, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:45am William Harris PhD Candidate University of Wisconsin-Madison Talk Abstract: Several recent operating systems provide system calls that allow an application to explicitly manage the privileges of modules with which the application interacts. Such privilege-aware operating systems allow a programmer to write a program that satisfies a strong security policy, even when the program interacts with untrusted modules. However, it is often non-trivial to rewrite a program to correctly use the system calls to satisfy a high-level security policy. This talk concerns the policy-weaving problem, which is to take as input a program, a desired high-level policy for the program, and a description of how system calls affect privilege, and automatically rewrite the program to invoke the system calls so that it satisfies the policy. We describe a reduction from the policy-weaving problem to finding a winning strategy to a two-player safety game. We then describe a policy-weaver generator that implements the reduction, and present an experimental evaluation of the generator applied to a model of the Capsicum capability system. We conclude by outlining ongoing work in applying the generator to a model of the HiStar decentralized-information-flow control (DIFC) system.

Thu, Mar 27 2014, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:45am Hongning Wang PhD Candidate University of Illinois at Champaign - Urbana Talk Abstract: Mining actionable knowledge from big data provides remarkable opportunities for optimizing operations and decision making in many application domains, such as improving health care, enhancing homeland security, and accelerating scientific discovery. Since a large portion of data is produced by humans, and, more importantly, they are the ultimate consumer of knowledge, putting humans into the loop of mining big data is essential to maximize the utility of the mined knowledge. However, most existing work on big data mining has taken a data-centric perspective and emphasized efficiency and scalability of the computational infrastructures and algorithms for mining large data sets, but without much consideration of the human factors. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of \u00echuman-centric big data mining,\u00ee where the dual role of humans as both data producers and knowledge consumers must be explicitly considered; and I will present my work on mining human-generated data to discover various forms of knowledge, as well as exploiting the mined knowledge about people to optimize knowledge services for human consumers. Specifically, I will first introduce a new mining problem called Latent Aspect Rating Analysis (LARA) for analyzing human-generated opinionated text data to discover individual users\u00ed latent opinions and preferences at the level of topical aspects. To solve the LARA problem, a unified probabilistic generative model is proposed, and it proves to be effective and enables a wide range of novel applications to bring benefit to many users such as ordinary consumers and business intelligence analysts. I will then discuss how to optimize a knowledge service system (e.g., a search engine s! ystem) via mining users\u00ed interactive behaviors recorded in the system\u00eds log data. I will show that by mining such log data, we can automatically organize the scattered long-term interaction behaviors of users into semantically coherent user-tasks, which can then be further exploited to explicitly model individual users\u00ed information need and decision preferences and optimize the service of a big data application system for each user in a personalized manner.

Tue, Feb 18 2014, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:30am Deepayan Chakrabarti Research Scientist Facebook Talk Abstract: From humble beginnings a decade or so ago, online advertising has rapidly grown into a huge business, with revenues of 40 billion dollars last year. The driving forces behind its rise have been technological advances in learning from huge datasets, as well as the ability to serve ads and content at massive scales with low marginal costs. In this talk, I will discuss these two aspects in the context of personalization at the per-user level. Specifically, we will look into how the social network of users can be leveraged to quickly learn personalized models for estimating click-thru rates of users on ads and other content. We will discuss models, analyze their properties, understand why some work while others do not, and present scalable inference methods for estimating the (potentially billions of) user-level parameters in such models. Our methods are also broadly applicable to settings with known relationships between features, such as categorical features (e.g., age \"buckets\") obtained by binning of continuous-valued features. About the Speaker: Deepayan Chakrabarti graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005, having worked on large-scale graph mining with Prof. Christos Faloutsos.

In this talk, I define a new tensor dynamical model for multivariate data as well as an efficient algorithm for learning such models from data. In addition, I will present an efficient approach to jointly estimate parameters and latent states for a large class of models including nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, I will present my work on efficient inference for a probabilistic declarative programming language, which aims to democratize machine learning and to enable practitioners to solve their domain specific problems. About the Speaker: Dr. Lei Li is a Post-Doctoral researcher at EECS department of UC Berkeley. His research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning, statistical inference and database systems. Specifically, he has been working on Bayesian inference in open universe probabilistic models, probabilistic programming language, large-scale learning, time series, communication and social networks.

Fri, Mar 21 2014, 3:30pm 480 Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:45am Karsten Schwan CERCS Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems College of Computing, Georgia Tech Talk Abstract: This talk presents the opportunities and challenges presented by future memory technologies like non-volatile RAM (NVM) that offer increased memory capacity as well as fast persistent storage. Prior research has focused either on improving memory scalability by replacing DRAMs with PCM or improving persistent storage by using PCM as nonvolatile heap. In resource constrained end user devices like Smartphones and tablets, however, and likely, also for future exascale machine nodes, it is desirable to leverage PCM for both its capacity and persistence properties. Our research, therefore, is exploring how to obtain these 'dual benefits' of PCM. Specifically, we investigate and evaluate the impact of using PCM for its persistence properties on the performance of applications that are using PCM for capacity. We show that current shared last level cache architectures will cause severe impacts on applications requiring increased memory capacity when there are co-runners using PCM for persistence, via increased cache miss rates experienced by 'capacity' applications. In response, we propose novel methods that e.g., use application page contiguity metrics to reduce such misses. We also investigate other software overheads like those relating to memory allocation allocator, then develop methods to reduce them by redesigning allocator data structures. Current results obtained for end devices are now being extended to also consider server systems and applications. About the Speaker: Dr. Schwan is a Regents' Professor in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Thu, Feb 20 2014, 4pm Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 480 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:45am Damon McCoy Assistant Professor George Mason University Talk Abstract: Modern day cybercrime is largely profit-fueled and much of modern day computer security is focused on developing new defenses that close security gaps, which allow criminals to exploit vulnerable systems. However, this focus on understanding the technical methods used by cyber criminals has not been matched by a complimentary effort to understand the underlying socio-economic factors that drive much of this large scale cybercrime. In this talk, I will describe my work on understanding the economics, capabilities and limitations of cyberciminal enterprises and how this has led to the disruption of two cybercrime ecosystems. First, I will describe the counterfeit pharmaceutical spam ecosystem from a socio-economic perspective and how this approach resulted in an effective payment processing level intervention. I will then describe an approach that also relies on a socio-economic understanding to disrupt the market for fraudulent accounts, which are sold by the thousand and are used to perpetrate scams, phishing, and malware via webmail and online social networking sites. These examples illustrate that, by understanding the socio-economic underpinnings of cybercrime, we can undermine cyberciminal ecosystems more efficiently than by using purely technical approaches.

Thu, Feb 13 2014, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Registration: Mon, Feb 24 2014, 9:30am Yang Wang PhD Candidate The University of Texas at Austin Talk Abstract: When building storage systems that aim to simultaneously provide robustness, scalability, and efficiency, one faces a fundamental tension, as higher robustness typically incurs higher costs and thus hurts both efficiency and scalability. My research takes two crucial steps on this difficult road. First, it shows that an approach to storage system design based on a simple principle-separating data from metadata- can yield systems that address elegantly and effectively that tension in a variety of settings. Two observations motivate our approach: first, data in storage systems is usually big (4K to several MBs) while metadata is comparatively small (tens of bytes); second, metadata, if carefully designed, can be used to validate data integrity. These observations suggest an opportunity: by applying the expensive techniques that guarantee robustness against a wide range of failures only to metadata, which has little effect on scalability, it may be possible to protect data as well with minimal cost. We show how to exploit effectively this opportunity in two very different systems: Gnothi-a storage replication protocol that combines the high availability of asynchronous replication and the low cost of synchronous replication for a small-scale block storage; and Salus-a large-scale block storage with unprecedented guarantees in terms of consistency, availability, and durability in the face of a wide range of server failures. The second step we take addresses a basic question faced by all researchers working on scalable storage: how can we validate the claims of scalability of our storage system prototypes? Today, the largest academic testbed we are aware of has about 1,000 machines and 1PB of disk space, which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the state-of-the-art for large-scale storage in industry; a gap that is likely to increase in the future. To mitigate this gap, we have built Exalt, an emulation tool to run a large storage system with 100 times fewer machines by compressing data on I/O devices and in memory. Once again, the key to our design is separating data from metadata: we have leveraged the observation that the behavior of storage systems often does not depend on the actual data being stored and developed Tardis, a synthetic data format that allows applications to quickly differentiate data from metadata and achieve high rates of data compression.

However, the complexity, diversity, frequently changed workloads, and rapid evolution of big data systems raise great challenges in big data benchmarking. This talk presents our joint research efforts on this issue with several industrial partners. Our big data benchmark suite - BigDataBench not only covers broad application scenarios, but also includes diverse and representative data sets. BigDataBench is publicly available from http://prof.ict.ac.cn/BigDataBench . So as to explore Big Data systems and architectures, we quantify characteristics of comprehensive big data workload performance and energy efficiency on four representative state-of-practice platforms with brawny-core, wimpy multi-core, and wimpy many-core processors. Our evaluations show: (1) none of the microprocessors we study consistently wins in terms of both performance and energy efficiency for all of our Big Data workloads, and (2) there are different classes of Big Data workloads, and each class of workload realizes better performance and energy efficiency on different Big Data architectures. We should eschew one-size-fits-all solutions, and instead tailor system designs to specific workload requirements. About the Speaker: Jianfeng Zhan is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is Deputy Director of Computer Systems Research Center, ICT, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

They are offering pervasive data and voice services for billions of mobile users. As a critical network infrastructure, it is supposed to function correctly and reliably. However, due to its complexity, especially in the control plane, the operational mobile networks are not sound and solid as anticipated. In this talk, we have explored the control-plan protocol interaction and revealed problematic interations which have never been disclosed before.\u00a0 Specifically, we propose signaling diagnosis tools and uncover six instances of problematic interactions. We show that, such control-plane issues span both design defects in the 3GPP standards and operational slips by carriers. They happen along three dimensions of cross layers, cross (circuit-switched and packet-switched) domains, and cross (3G and 4G) systems.We not only verify them through formal method but also validate them through real experiments in operational cellular networks.

Fri, May 30 2014, 10am Dreese Labs 260 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus , OH 43210 United States Louis-Noel Pouchet Visiting Assistant Professor University of California, Los Angeles Talk Abstract: For application developers, the era of improved performance \"for free\" by means of increased clock speed and on-chip instruction-level parallelism is over. We saw dramatic and disruptive changes to the cope, with multi-core processors becoming ubiquitous, and power density and energy considerations becoming the primary constraints driving technology directions. Customized accelerators, as illustrated by the work of the Center for Domain-Specific Computing, emerge as one of the key components to achieve the power efficiency demanded in the next-generation computing devices. Non-homogeneous CPU cores and ever-increasing complexity of System-on-Chips are on the roadmap of most manufacturers. In a word, computing platforms are now heterogeneous, after decades of mass-marketing homogeneous single-core x86 processors. These developments have dramatically changed the role and expectations of optimizing compilers: we expect from them high performance of the application for a wide variety of targets, which is absolutely critical both for embedded and mainstream computing as well as the push to exascale computing at the high end. Three key challenges have arisen from these changes, and must be tackled to deliver the much anticipated energy and execution time improvements those architectures have been designed for. Performance portability, to improve the productivity of developers. Application modeling, to bridge the semantics gap between the application designer and the input to the compilation toolchain. Hardware acceleration, to leverage the purpose-optimized computing capability of the hardware for a given application. In this talk I will present current and upcoming research to address the above challenges, crossing the boundaries between application design, compiler optimization, and architectural configuration; and give perspective on the next milestones in optimizing compilation research in the big data era. About the Speaker: Louis-Noel Pouchet is a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is an active member of the NSF Center for Domain-Specific Computing (CDSC), working on both software and hardware customization.

Tue, Oct 28 2014, 4pm Ohio State - CSE 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH United States Deep Representation Learning: Challenges and New Directions Machine learning is a powerful tool for tackling challenging problems in artificial intelligence. In practice, success of machine learning algorithms critically depends on the feature representations for input data, which often becomes a limiting factor. To address this problem, deep learning methods have recently emerged as successful techniques to learn feature hierarchies from unlabeled and labeled data. In this talk, I will present my perspectives on the progress, challenges, and some new directions. Specifically, I will talk about my recent work to address the following interrelated challenges: (1) how can we learn invariant yet discriminative features, and furthermore disentangle underlying factors of variation to model high-order interactions between the factors? (2) how can we learn representations of the output data when the output variables have complex high-order dependencies? (3) how can we learn shared representations from heterogeneous input data modalities? Honglak Lee is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Of the many challenges facing drug discovery, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) constitute an especially difficult one. Societally, and economically NTDs constitute the most common infections of the world\u2019s poorest people. This class of diseases encompasses a number of infection categories including helminth infections, protozoan infections, bacterial infections, and viral infections. Cumulatively, these diseases impact a significant majority of the world\u2019s population and various studies have indicated NTDs to be the prime factors depriving the affected populations of their health and economic potential. This talk will focus on the emerging technology of computational phenotypic screening and how it can be applied for early-stage drug screening for NTDs. Specifically, I will talk about how techniques from computational imaging, time-series analysis, and machine learning can be interfaced with parasitology, high-throughput biology, and chemistry to design new methodologies for drug discovery against one of the most significant tropical diseases called schistosomiasis. Rahul Singh is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at San Francisco State University and Professor by affiliation, at the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases, University of California, San Francisco.

Thu, Feb 12 2015, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , United States Sparse Modeling for High-Dimensional Multi-Manifold Data Analysis One of the most fundamental challenges facing scientists and engineers across different fields, such as computer vision, robotics, bioinformatics and speech/image processing, is the large amounts of high-dimensional data that need to be analyzed and understood. In this talk, I present provably correct and efficient algorithms, based on the sparse representation theory, for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets by exploiting their underlying low-dimensional structures. I talk about algorithms for the two fundamental problems of clustering and subset selection in unions of subspaces and discuss the robustness of the algorithms to data nuisances. I show that these tools effectively advance the state-of-the-art data analysis in a wide range of important real-world problems, such as segmentation of motions in videos, clustering of images of objects, energy disaggregation and learning nonlinear dynamical models. Ehsan Elhamifar is a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University. Ehsan is broadly interested in developing provably correct and efficient data analysis algorithms that can address challenges of complex and large-scale high-dimensional datasets. Specifically, he focuses on the intrinsic low-dimensionality of real data and uses tools from convex geometry and analysis, sparse / low-rank representation, high-dimensional statistics and graph theory to develop such algorithms. Ehsan obtained MS and MSE degrees in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, respectively, from Sharif University of Technology in Iran and the Johns Hopkins University.

Thu, Oct 9 2014, 4pm Ohio State - CSE 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH United States Scalable Nonparametric Machine Learning Nonparametric methods in machine learning do not fix the number of parameters (the model complexity) upfront, but instead allow the data itself to determine the number of parameters, making these methods attractive for various data analysis tasks.\u00a0 Unfortunately, many nonparametric methods scale poorly with the number of data points, making their use in large-scale settings difficult.\u00a0 Much of my recent research is concerned with developing new tools that allow for scalable nonparametric analysis of data.\u00a0 In this talk, I will focus on a technique called small-variance asymptotics, which can be used to transform rich nonparametric statistical models into scalable combinatorial optimization problems.\u00a0 In particular, in the classical (parametric) clustering setting, the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians approaches the k-means algorithm as the variance of the clusters goes to zero.\u00a0 Similarly, I will discuss how to apply a similar idea to a number of interesting nonparametric problems including clustering, feature learning, topic modeling, sequential data analysis, and cluster evolution over time.\u00a0 We ultimately obtain scalable nonparametric algorithms that are often orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Tue, Mar 10 2015, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , United States Practical Learning Algorithms for Structured Prediction Models The desired output in many machine learning tasks is a structured object such as a tree, a clustering of nodes, or a sequence. Learning accurate prediction models for such problems requires training on large amounts of data, making use of expressive features and performing global inference that simultaneously assigns values to all interrelated nodes in the structure. All these contribute to significant scalability problems. We describe a collection of results that address several aspects of these problems \u2013 by carefully selecting and caching samples, structures, or latent items. Our results lead to efficient learning algorithms for structured prediction models and for online clustering models which, in turn, support reduction in problem size, improvements in training and evaluation speed and improved performance. We have used our algorithms to learn expressive models from large amounts of annotated data and achieve state-of-the art performance on several natural language processing tasks.

Thu, Feb 19 2015, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , United States Mining and Predicting a Complex Networked World: Theory, Models and Applications Recent rapid advances in computational data-driven information and knowledge discovery have helped solve important technological problems and answer big scientific questions, with tremendous economic and societal impacts. Networks are at the heart of this revolution\u2014from biological, ecological, and transportation networks, to online social networks, media streaming and online retail services that reach over three billion users and are valued at well over one trillion dollars. How can we use this vast amount of data to answer fundamental questions, such as how does one forecast the growth or demise of online social network companies? And, more specifically, why did four large online social networks\u2014namely MySpace, Hi5, Friendster and Multiply\u2014synchronously go from growth and stability to their sudden downfall in the summer of 2008? MySpace was valued at $2 billion at its peak in 2008, and yet sold for a tiny fraction of that three years later. MySpace\u2019s seemingly inexplicable sudden death still negatively impacts valuations of Internet companies today. In my talk, I argue that such elusive problems require crossing disciplinary boundaries, especially those between epidemiology, population ecology, information theory, statistics, and psychology. I specifically look at how modeling limited user attention predicts the growth and death of Internet startups and how it offers an explanation for the 2008 mysterious demise of Facebook competitors. Finally, in the last part of my talk I turn to the more general problem of forecasting the evolution of complex network processes. Using information theory tools I unveil an apparent paradox, where larger online social networks entail more user data but also less analytic and forecasting capabilities. Part of the content of this talk was featured in both specialized and popular media outlets including CNET, ACM TechNews, and The Pittsburgh-Post Gazette.

In recent years, emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as flash are orders of magnitude faster than hard disks. Next-generation NVMs such as phase change memory and the memristor are byte-addressable and promise to have close-to-DRAM performance. These NVM technologies are poised to radically alter the performance landscape for storage systems, blurring the line between memory and storage. To fully utilize them and deliver their good performance to applications, system designers need to rethink how to efficiently manage them as reliable storage at different layers. In this talk, I will discuss new challenges NVM technologies present to system designers and the systems that I have built to efficiently manage them. My approach is to vertically rethink different layers in a system and optimize them in a coherent way to deliver all the capabilities of the new NVM technologies. Specifically, I will present Mojim, a system that provides reliable and highly-available non-volatile main memory in data center environments. Mojim uses a flexible architecture and efficient software and networking stacks to achieve good data replication performance that is close to or even better than un-replicated single-node system. I will also present another system that I built for flash-based solid state drives (SSDs), where I remove excess indirection and its overhead in current SSDs. Finally, I will discuss my future research plans in building systems for \"little\" big data. Yiying Zhang is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, where she works with Professor Steven Swanson in the Non-Volatile Systems Lab. Her research interests span operating systems, distributed systems, computer architecture, networking, and data analytics, with a focus on building fast, reliable, and flexible systems for emerging hardware and applications. She is currently interested in system implications of non-volatile main memory. In the past, she has worked in various aspects of storage systems, including removing excess indirection in storage systems, storage-level caching, and redundant arrays. Yiying received her Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2013, under the supervision of Professors Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.

Despite a recent interest in the testing community in creating and evaluating test oracles, still there are a number of problem domains for which a practical test oracle does not exist in the general case. This lecture will present a variety of techniques for testing these \u201cnon-testable programs.\u201d The talk will explore the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches for addressing the so-called \u201coracle problem,\u201d and conclude with a discussion of recent research in this area.

Unlike traditional search engines retrieving numerous webpages, techniques that can precisely and directly answer user questions are becoming more desired. In this talk, I will discuss two\u00a0strategies:\u00a0(1) Human collaborative query resolution.\u00a0We made the first attempt to quantitatively analyze expert routing behaviors, i.e., how an expert decides where to transfer a question when she could not solve it.\u00a0 A computational routing model was then developed to\u00a0optimize team formation and team communication for more efficient problem solving;\u00a0(2) Machine intelligent query resolution, where I will present two novel frameworks:\u00a0(i)\u00a0Schema-less knowledge graph querying.\u00a0This framework directly searches knowledge bases to answer user queries.\u00a0It successfully deals with the challenge that\u00a0answers to user queries could not be simply retrieved by exact keyword and graph matching, due to\u00a0different information representations.\u00a0(ii)\u00a0Combining knowledge bases with the Web.\u00a0 We recognized that\u00a0knowledge bases\u00a0are usually far from complete and information required to answer questions may not always exist in knowledge bases. This framework mines answers directly from large-scale web resources, and meanwhile employs knowledge bases as a significant auxiliary to boost question answering performance. I will conclude by discussing future directions, including leveraging both machine and human intelligence for better question answering and decision making in healthcare and business intelligence. Huan\u00a0Sun\u00a0is a Ph.D. candidate in the\u00a0Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\u00a0Her research interests lie in data mining and machine learning, with emphasis on text mining, network analysis and human behavior understanding.

DataFlow computers, compared to ControlFlow computers, offer speeds up of 20 to 200 (even 2000 for some applications), power reductions of about 20, and size reductions of also about 20. However, the programming paradigm is different, and has to be mastered. The talk explains the paradigm, using Maxeler as an example, and sheds light on the ongoing research in the field. Examples include DataEngineering, DataMining, FinancialAnalytics, etc. A recent study from Tsinghua University in China reveals that, for Shallow Water Weather Forecast, which is a BigData problem, on the 1U level, the Maxeler DataFlow machine is 14 times faster than the Tianhe machine, which is rated #1 on the Top 500 list (based on Linpack, which is a small data benchmark). Given enough time, the talk also gives a tutorial about the programming in space, which is the programming paradigm used for the Maxeler dataflow machines (established in 2014 by Stanford, Imperial, Tsinghua, and the University of Tokyo). Examples (appgallery.maxeler.com and webIDE.maxeler.com). Prof. Veljko Milutinovic received his PhD from the University of Belgrade (rated #366 world-wide at the U.S. News Report 2015), spent\u00a0 about a decade on various faculty positions in the USA (mostly at Purdue University), and was a co-designer of the DARPAs first GaAs RISC microprocessor. Now he teaches and conducts research at the University of Belgrade, in EE and MATH (Belgrade math is rated #87 world-wide at the U.S. News Report 2015). His research is mostly in datamining algorithms and dataflow computing, with the stress on mappings of algorithms onto architectures. His co-authored paper on matrix multiplication for dataflow received \"The IET Premium Award for 2014\" (meaning the best paper in IET Computing for 2012 and 2013). His paper on the research methodology was published in an ASCE journal and received a special recognition for the most downloaded paper of the publisher. He published over 20 books with the USA publishers. For 7 of his books, forewords were written by 7 different Nobel Laureates with whom he cooperated on his past industry sponsored projects. He has over 60 IEEE or ACM journal papers, and about 3000 Google Scholar citations.

Unlike prior work in human computation, my \u201cCrowd Agent\u201d model allows crowds of people to support continuous real-time interactive systems that require ongoing context. For example, Chorus allows multi-session conversations with a virtual personal assistant; Scribe allows non-experts to caption speech in real time for deaf and hard of hearing users, where prior approaches were either not accurate enough, or required professionals with years of training; and Apparition allows designers to rapidly prototype new interactive interfaces from sketches in real time. In this talk, I will describe how computationally-mediated groups of people can solve problems that neither people nor computers can solve alone, and scaffold AI systems using the real-world data they collect. Walter S. Lasecki is a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester working with Jeffrey Bigham (CMU) and James Allen (Rochester). He creates interactive intelligent systems that are robust enough to be used in real-world settings by combining both human and machine\u00a0intelligence\u00a0to exceed the capabilities of either.

Tue, Feb 24 2015, 4pm 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , United States Diffusion Centrality in Social Networks We propose Diffusion Centrality (DC) in which semantic aspects of a social network are used to characterize vertices that are influential in diffusing a property p. In contrast to classical centrality measures, diffusion centrality of vertices varies with the property p. We show that DC applies to most known diffusion models including tipping, cascade, and homophilic models. We present a hypergraph-based algorithm (HyperDC) with many optimizations to exactly compute DC of vertices. However, HyperDC does not scale well to huge SNs (millions of vertices, tens of millions of edges). For scaling, we develop methods to coarsen a network and propose a heuristic algorithm called \u201cCoarsened Back and Forth\u201d or CBAF to compute the top-k vertices (having the highest diffusion centrality w.r.t. p). We describe a prototype implementation of HyperDC and\u00a0 CBAF, and report on experiments comparing DC with classical centrality measures in terms of runtime and the \u201cspread\u201d achieved by the k most central vertices (using data from 7 real-world social networks and 3 different diffusion models). Our extensive experiments show that DC produces much higher quality results and is comparable to several centrality measures in terms of runtime. Moreover, the CBAF approximate algorithm is extremely fast and achieves a very high spread.

In this talk, I will present our attempt in attacking this problem using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach adopted a multi-style training strategy using artificially mixed speech data. I will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of several different setups that we have investigated including a WFST-based two-talker decoder to work with the trained DNNs. Experiments on the 2006 speech separation and recognition challenge task demonstrate that the proposed DNN-based system has remarkable robustness to the interference of a competing speaker. The best setup of our proposed systems achieves an overall WER of 18.8% which improves upon the results obtained by the state-of-the-art IBM superhuman system by 2.8% absolute, with fewer assumptions. Dr. Dong Yu is a principal researcher at the Microsoft speech and dialog research group. His research interests include speech processing, robust speech recognition, discriminative training, and machine learning.

Thu, Sep 25 2014, 4pm Ohio State - CSE 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH United States Random Walks on Simplicial Complexes and Isoperimetric Inequalities The graph Laplacian has been of interest in statistics, machine learning, and theoretical computer science in areas from manifold learning to analysis of Markov chains. A common use of the graph Laplacian has been in spectral clustering and dimension reduction. A theoretical motivation for why spectral clustering works is the Cheeger inequality which relates the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian to how disconnected the graph is. We ask how the Cheeger inequality extends to higher-order Laplacians, operators on simplicial complexes, and what clustering means for these higher-order operators. Related to the graph Laplacian is the idea of random walks on graphs. We will define a random walk on simplicial complexes with a stationary distribution that is related to the k-dimensional Laplacian. The stationary distribution reveals (co)homology of the geometry of the random walk. We apply this random walk to the problem of semi-supervised learning, given some labeled observations and many unlabeled observations how does one propagate the labels. Joint work with John Steenbergen and Carly Klivans. Sayan Mukherjee is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Statistical Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science and an Associate Director in the Information Initiative at Duke. He has a PhD from MIT and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

This is one of the most well-studied problems in algorithm design and it is often used as a benchmark for optimization techniques. An important special case of TSP consists of cities in a geometric space such as a surface or a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We present a new approximation algorithm for the case of surfaces which yields an exponential improvement over the previously best-known result. For the case of Euclidean space we prove that the running time of the currently best-known algorithms are nearly optimal.

However, despite massive data growth in the sciences, it remains unclear whether Big Data methods can lead to scientific breakthroughs on par with experimentation and simulation. I will introduce a new knowledge discovery paradigm -- theory-guided data science -- that brings together novel data analysis methods and powerful scientific theory to extract knowledge from complex spatio-temporal data. The principles of this paradigm will be demonstrated with data mining applications to dynamic clustering, analyzing brain fMRI data, and monitoring global ocean dynamics. James Faghmous is a Research Associate at the University of Minnesota where he develops new data science methods for data-intensive scientific discovery. In 2015, James received an inaugural NSF CRII Award for junior faculty and his doctoral dissertation received the \"Outstanding Dissertation Award\" in Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota.

But can we exploit idiosyncrasies of real-world networks to attack this NP-hard problem successfully? In this talk I will answer this question in the affirmative. Specifically, I will present a significant advance in routines with rigorous theoretical guarantees for scalable extraction of large near-cliques from large-scale networks, the k-clique densest subgraph problem. I\u00a0 will present exact, approximation, and MapReduce algorithms that allow us to scale our computations to large-scale networks. At the heart of our scalable algorithm lies a densest subgraph sparsifier theorem. Our approach allows us to extract large near-(bi)cliques from a diverse collection of networks with millions of edges within few seconds. Finally, I will present interesting graph mining findings such as anomaly detection in real-world networks. I will conclude my talk with some interesting open problems. Dr. Charalampos Tsourakakis is currently a CRCS Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. from the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He also holds a Master of Science from the Machine Learning Department at CMU. He did his undergraduate studies in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). He is the recipient of a best paper award in IEEE Data Mining and has designed two graph mining libraries for tera-scale graphs. The former has been officially included in Windows Azure, and the latter was a research highlight of Microsoft Research. His main research interest lies in designing scalable and data-aware algorithms for massive networks that recover hidden structure and solve complex data-driven problems.

In my group, we are studying models for software design and management in the post-Denard era. Our work targets Internet services where response time affects profit.\u00a0 Service level objectives are widely used to align response time and business costs. Zoolander is a model-driven middleware for key-value stores that parallelizes lookups cost effectively, trading costly service-level violations for less costly replication.\u00a0 When systems-level management, e.g., replication, does not suffice to meet SLOs, approximation may be an answer.\u00a0 Ubora measures the effect of approximation on the quality of answers produced by a service.\u00a0 Consider the OpenEphyra question-answering system, a mature query execution may yield the same answer as a partial execution because of redundancy within the data. We\u2019ve used OpenEphyra in Jeopardy competitions with 7th and 8th graders, as a part of our outreach efforts.\u00a0 We used Ubora to control approximation during the competitions.\u00a0 Early outcomes suggest that approximation can significantly reduce response time without degrading answer quality too much (i.e., our system still wins!). Dr. Stewart is an assistant professor in the computer science and engineering department at The Ohio State University.\u00a0 He leads the ReRout Lab where high-impact research produces novel systems and diverse expertise that broadens computer science, i.e., research that reaches out.\u00a0 Dr. Stewart\u2019s research spans all aspects of Internet services from server hardware and datacenters to operating systems and middleware to novel emerging workloads.\u00a0 His recent research has focused on 1) cost/energy efficiency for infrastructure services and 2) powering services with clean energy.\u00a0 Dr. Stewart is a recipient of the prestigious NSF Career Award.\u00a0 He has co-authored award papers at two international conferences and served as a founding member of the IEEE Special Technical Committee on Sustainable Computing.

Thu, Feb 25 2016, 4pm Gang Wang 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210 Human Factors in the Security of Online Systems Human factors are playing an increasingly important role in the security of today\u2019s online systems. The successful operation of large systems like online social networks relies on well-behaved users contributing high-quality user content. An improved understanding of user behavior is instrumental to identifying misbehaving users and attacks in such systems, as well as to understand and defend against a new class of malicious crowdsourcing attacks. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to improve security by characterizing and modeling complex human behaviors. First, I will describe our use of clickstream analysis to build accurate user behavior models that effectively capture anomalous users and previously unknown attacks on online systems. Second, I will describe our recent results on building highly \u201cinterpretable\u201d behavior models, which help us to characterize user behavior at multiple levels of granularity and track their behavioral changes over time. Finally, I will briefly summarize my work on understanding and defending against human-based attacks (malicious crowdsourcing).\u00a0 I conclude by highlighting my future plans on using data-driven approaches to building human-centric security systems. G ang Wang is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara under the supervision of Ben Y. Zhao and Heather Zheng. His research focuses on human (user) aspects of Internet security. His work takes a data-driven approach to address emerging security threats in online social networks, crowdsourcing systems, and mobile networks and applications. He earned a B.E. in Electronic Engineering in 2010 at Tsinghua University. He is the recipient of PhD dissertation fellowship from UC Santa Barbara (2015), and best practical paper award from ACM SIGMETRICS (2013).

Fri, Dec 18 2015, 9:30am Bryan Choi Bryan Choi 480 Dreese Labs Columbus , OH 43210 United States For Whom the Data Tolls: A Reunified Theory of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Jurisprudence Data privacy demands a reunified theory of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Data technologies allow personal information to be disembodied from physical bodies and \u201cpossessed\u201d simultaneously by both first persons and third parties. As a result, the government has been able to use a divide-and-conquer strategy to obtain incriminating evidence alternately from the data intermediary or from the suspect. Currently, Fourth Amendment doctrine and Fifth Amendment doctrine work at cross-purposes. The privacy community has already sounded the alarm on the \u201cthird-party doctrine,\u201d which allows the government to sidestep the Fourth Amendment when demanding evidence from third parties. But few have noted the equally potent \u201crequired records doctrine,\u201d which allows the government to circumvent the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when demanding evidence directly from first persons. Taken together, the two exceptions swallow the rule, allowing the government to evade both Fourth and Fifth Amendment review at every turn. This talk will argue that juxtaposing the two exceptions together offers clues for how to resolve the reciprocal line-drawing problems. The first clue is that one excludes only \u201cthird parties\u201d from constitutional protection, while the other excludes only \u201cfirst parties.\u201d The second is that the third-party doctrine grew out of cases upholding the autonomy of natural persons, whereas the required records doctrine drew its authority from the need to regulate commercial activities of business entities. Reframing the jurisprudence along those two axes offers a more coherent conception of the case law, and acknowledges the vital interdependencies between the two Amendments.

According to such grading schemes, each student receives a few assignments (by other students) which she has to rank. Then, a global ranking (possibly translated into numerical scores) is produced by combining the individual ones. This is a novel application area for social choice concepts and methods where the important problem to be solved is as follows: how should the assignments be distributed so that the collected individual rankings can be easily merged into a global one that is as close as possible to the ranking that represents the relative performance of the students in the assignment? Our main theoretical result suggests that using very simple ways to distribute the assignments so that each student has to rank only k of them, a Borda-like aggregation method can recover a 1-O(1/k) fraction of the true ranking when each student correctly ranks the assignments she receives. Experimental results strengthen our analysis further and also demonstrate that the same method is extremely robust even when students have imperfect capabilities as graders. Our results provide strong evidence that ordinal peer grading can be a highly effective and scalable solution for evaluation in MOOCs. Joint work with George A. Krimpas and Alexandros A.

This has exposed users to significant risk to their private information, as the constant stream of bad news in the media will attest. In this talk I will focus on my research efforts to better understand and protect against such loss. I will start with a focused review on the importance of online privacy, and highlight the privacy risks of location proximity, which has been adopted by major web services and mobile apps. This work demonstrated novel threats that can neutralize existing countermeasures used by the industry and pinpoint a user\u2019s location with high accuracy within seconds. To protect users, I developed a practical defense in the form of privacy-preserving proximity that obfuscates the user\u2019s location, which has been adopted by Facebook and Foursquare. I will demonstrate how user privacy also affects security mechanisms, and present my analysis of the threat surface of Facebook\u2019s social authentication system. I will then present a novel social authentication system that is robust against advanced targeted attacks and prevents adversaries from compromising user accounts, and conclude by sharing my thoughts for future directions. Jason Polakis is a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University. He earned his PhD in 2014 from the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete, Greece, where he was supported by the Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH). He is broadly interested in identifying the security and privacy limitations of Internet technologies, designing robust defenses and privacy-preserving techniques, and enhancing our understanding of the online ecosystem and its threats. His research has revealed significant flaws in popular services, and major vendors such as Google, Facebook and Foursquare have deployed his proposed defenses. His work has been published in top tier security conferences (Security and Privacy, CCS, and NDSS) as well as other top tier computer science conferences (WWW).

Thu, Feb 11 2016, 4pm Tuo Zhao 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave Columbus, Ohio Compute Faster and Learn Better: Machine Learning via Nonconvex Model-based Optimization Nonconvex optimization naturally arises in many machine learning problems (e.g. sparse learning, matrix factorization, and tensor decomposition). Machine learning researchers exploit various nonconvex formulations to gain modeling flexibility, estimation robustness, adaptivity, and computational scalability. Although classical computational complexity theory has shown that solving nonconvex optimization is generally NP-hard in the worst case, practitioners have proposed numerous heuristic optimization algorithms, which achieve outstanding empirical performance in real-world applications. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we propose a new generation of model-based optimization algorithms and theory, which incorporate the statistical thinking into modern optimization. Particularly, when designing practical computational algorithms, we take the underlying statistical models into consideration (e.g. sparsity, low rankness). Our novel algorithms exploit hidden geometric structures behind many nonconvex optimization problems, and can obtain global optima with the desired statistics properties in polynomial time with high probability.

However, little attention has been given to securing provenance-aware systems. Provenance itself is a ripe attack vector, and its authenticity and integrity must be guaranteed before it can be put to use. In this talk, I will detail my efforts to bring trustworthy data provenance to computing systems. These efforts have led to the design and implementation of a provenance-aware operating system anchored in trusted hardware, and a mechanism that leverages the confinement properties provided by Mandatory Access Controls to perform efficient policy-based provenance collection. Using these architectures, I will demonstrate that provenance is an invaluable tool for combating critical security threats including data exfiltration, SQL injection, and even binary exploitation. By addressing key security and performance challenges, this work paves the way for the further proliferation of provenance capabilities.

We investigate the relation between AUC maximization and minimization of ranking risk under a convex loss in bipartite ranking, and characterize general conditions for ranking-calibration akin to classification-calibration. The best ranking functions under convex ranking-calibrated loss criteria are shown to produce the same ordering of instances as the likelihood ratio of the positive category to the negative category over the instance space. The result illuminates the parallel between ranking and classification in general, and suggests the notion of consistency in bipartite ranking. The optimality of ranking algorithms is further considered in multipartite ranking through minimization of the theoretical risk which combines pairwise ranking errors of ordinal categories with differential ranking costs. The extension shows that for a certain class of convex loss functions, the optimal ranking function can be represented as a ratio of weighted conditional probability of the upper categories to the lower categories, where the weights are given by the pairwise ranking costs. The theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical examples. This is joint work with Kazuki Uematsu.

However, building systems in these modern platforms to provide reliable services is difficult. This is evidenced by the fact that despite the large amount of work put into reliability, all modern systems (i.e., cloud and mobile) continue to experience million-dollar outages and frustrating anomalies like battery drain. In this talk, I will describe my research efforts to better understand and proactively deal with the reliability challenges in modern systems. First I will discuss work that examines failures in cloud services. Instead of focusing on conventional root-cause analysis, this work takes a unique angle to look into the fault-tolerance mechanisms in cloud, and analyze why they did not prevent the service failures. I will summarize several challenges (opportunities) facing cloud system reliability. One such challenge is misconfiguration: existing fault-tolerance techniques often cannot tolerate (or worse are nullified by) configuration errors; and misconfiguration becomes a major source of cloud outages. I will then present work that enables cloud practitioners to proactively prevent configuration error by using a systematic validation framework. The framework consists of a declarative language to express configuration specification, a service that continuously checks if configuration obeys its specification, and a tool that automatically infers basic specification. I will also briefly cover the challenge of app misbehavior in mobile devices and proactive system-level solution to tackle app misbehavior.

Recent technologies such as Bitcoin \u00a0have the potential to further enhance the way we conduct electronic commerce. In this talk, I will describe my work in developing a robust theory of\u00a0privacy-preserving\u00a0contracts that are self-enforcing and do not require third-party intervention. Starting from Bitcoin-inspired abstractions, the theory enables building provably secure and scalable applications on top of cryptocurrencies. Ranjit Kumaresan is currently a postdoc at MIT CSAIL. Previously he did a\u00a0postdoc at the Technion and a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland. His research interests are in cryptography, security,\u00a0privacy, and theory of computation.

Matus Telgarsky obtained his PhD in Computer Science at UCSD in 2013 under Sanjoy Dasgupta; while there, his research focused primarily upon optimization and statistical aspects of unconstrained and unregularized algorithms (e.g., boosting), and to a lesser extent clustering. Thereafter he has been a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University and the University of Michigan, as well as a consulting researcher at Microsoft Research in New York City; his most recent research focus has been representation and nonconvex optimization.

We will show that at least in an extreme theoretical sense this may not be entirely impossible. Under some idealized assumptions we show that there is an investment strategy that doesn't lose beyond a negligible (exponentially small) amount if the market falls and gains at least some if the market has high gains. The assumption we make is that the per day change in stock price is bounded -- say at most 1%. Under more realistic assumptions this work shows how to obtain the optimal trade-off between risk and reward in an investment strategy. We will also look at how these algorithms do in practice.

VoG disentangles the complex graph connectivity patterns, and efficiently summarizes large graphs with important and semantically meaningful structures by leveraging information theoretic methods. DeltaCon is a well-founded, fast method that detects and explains changes in time-evolving or aligned networks by assessing their similarity. Both works are being used by industry, and give interesting discoveries in large real-world graphs. Danai Koutra is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon.

Imagine a future where machines interact with us like humans, waking us up in the morning, navigating us to work, or discussing our daily schedules in a coordinated and natural manner. Current interactive systems being developed by Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon attempt to reach this goal by combining a large set of single-task systems. But products like Siri, Google Now, Cortana and Echo still follow pre-specified agendas that cannot transition between tasks smoothly and track and adapt to different users naturally. My research draws on recent developments in speech and natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and machine learning to work towards the goal of developing situated intelligent interactive systems. These systems can coordinate with users to achieve effective and natural interactions. I have successfully applied the proposed concepts to various tasks, such as social conversation, job interview training and movie promotion.

Can we build intelligent and trustworthy user-oriented systems by analyzing massive behavior data of the interactions? In principle, data-driven approaches can extend the methodology of observation, representation and models beyond our eyes and hands. However, we lack means to fully exploit the structured contextual information and unstructured content information. In this talk, I will present three lines of work towards this goal: (1) Mining behavior network with social spatiotemporal context. (i) How can we recommend items in social network mechanism? What are the key factors of users' decisions? (ii) How can we catch suspicious behaviors made by smart bad actors? Instead of what they can do, what do they have to do? Two computational models were developed and deployed for social recommender systems and anti-fraud/spam systems; (2) Structuring behavioral content into attributed information network. Can we automatically discover attributes and facts from text corpus? A novel methodology, Meta Pattern mining, will be introduced for open-domain Information Extraction from the data-driven perspective; (3) Integrating behavior network with rich information network. I will uncover the potential of integrating structured and unstructured data for better understanding human behaviors, and conclude by sharing my thoughts for future directions.

At the same time, piecing together a complete landscape of attacks by identifying the strategies and capabilities of the adversaries requires establishing semantic links among individual observations. Also, defending these attacks require automatically generated semantics-aware policies to complement manual analysis. While semantic-aware inspection of security problem is a promising way to evaluate security risks and provide cyber intelligence, complicating the situation is the gap between security ontology and generic NLP primitives, which tend to be domain-sensitive, language-specific, and computationally intensive. In this talk, I will explore how to develop a cyber-threat gathering system that takes advantage of semantic-aware inspection to extract cyber intelligence of newly-appearing online crime from online blogs. I'll then discuss how to model emerging and previously imperceptible online crimes from the extracted cyber intelligence via large-scale data analytics. Finally, I will present an efficient and accurate security system based on large-scale semantic processing of text content to defend against these online crimes.

Specifically, we apply convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks to translate videos to English descriptions using an encoder/decoder framework.\u00a0 A sequence of image frames (represented using deep visual features) is first mapped to a vector encoding the full video, and then this encoding is mapped to a sequence of words. We have also explored how statistical linguistic knowledge mined from large text corpora, specifically LSTM language models and lexical embeddings, can improve the descriptions. Experimental evaluation on a corpus of short YouTube videos and movie clips annotated by Descriptive Video Service demonstrate the capabilities of the technique by comparing its output to human-generated descriptions.

Hence, these foundational systems inherently suffer from a variety of memory errors, and the exploitation of memory errors has become a critical attack vector. The past several years have continuously witnessed critical attacks targeting systems belonging to individuals, enterprises, and government agencies. Two typical goals of these attacks are to leak sensitive data and to control victim systems. My research aims to defeat memory-error exploits by preventing information leaks. In this talk, I will first present that since modern systems widely deploy memory-layout randomization techniques, leaking a randomized code pointer has become a prerequisite for advanced control attacks such as code-reuse attacks. Therefore, preventing information leaks can be a general defense that not only stops data leaks but also defeats control attacks. Then, I will present two systems I developed, UniSan and ASLR-Guard. Specifically, UniSan completely eliminates information leaks caused by reading uninitialized variables (the most common cause) in OS kernels, which has triggered extensive discussions in the Linux and GCC development communities, and resulted in many updates in the Linux kernel, the Android kernel, and the GCC compiler. Similarly, to defeat code-reuse attacks, which always require leaking a code pointer in modern systems, ASLR-Guard either prevents code-pointer leaks or renders the leaks useless in deriving the value of code pointers. While automatically and reliably securing complex systems such as OS kernels and web servers, both UniSan and ASLR-Guard impose negligible performance overhead.

However, when pushed too quickly to the market, the apps and services can be poorly engineered and may contain various vulnerabilities that can severely undermine users\u2019 security and privacy. While a significant amount of effort has focused on vetting various vulnerabilities in mobile apps, little attention has targeted remote services. In this talk, Dr. Lin is going to talk about how to automatically analyze mobile apps in searching for security vulnerabilities of remote services. In the first half of his talk, he will present a generic and scalable system dubbed AutoForge to identify password brute-force vulnerabilities in mobile services by using automatic protocol reverse engineering, dynamic slicing, and API replay. In the second half of the talk, he will describe SmartGen, a system to automatically reveal the server APIs of mobile apps and enable the standard vulnerability fuzzing with remote services via selective symbolic execution. Both AutoForge and SmartGen have been evaluated with a large set of mobile apps, and found hundreds of security vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Responsible disclosures have been made to all the vulnerable service providers, and Dr. Lin will also share this experience during his talk.

In this talk we introduce novel randomized methods to cope with large number of samples and huge number of features, while still maintaining the statistical power of big data. We first address learning from high-dimensional large-scale data using sketching and random projection to reduce the number of samples and features, respectively. However, we consider a recovery problem, i.e., how to accurately recover the solution to the optimization problem to the original big high-dimensional space based on the solution learned after applying sketching and random projection. We show that sketching methods meets the dual random recovery algorithm in dual space and show that using a logarithmic number of calls to solvers of small scale problem, the proposed primal-dual sketching method \u00a0is able to recover the optimum of the original problem up to arbitrary precision. We then introduce a new paradigm for optimization, dubbed mixed optimization (a.k.a stochastic optimization with variance reduction), which interpolates between stochastic and full gradient methods and is able to i) achieve faster convergence rate in stochastic optimization, and ii) condition number independent convergence rate in deterministic optimization.

Sensing via WiFi would enable remote sensing without wearable sensors, simultaneous perception and data transmission without extra communication infrastructure, and contactless sensing in privacy-preserving mode. Yet the concept of wireless and sensorless sensing is not the simple combination of WiFi and radar.

I will focus on a specific research problem that is central to the design of safe reinforcement learning algorithms: accurately predicting how well a policy would perform if it were to be used, given data collected from the deployment of a different policy. Solutions to this problem provide a way to determine that a newly proposed policy would be dangerous to use without requiring the dangerous policy to ever actually be used.

Making such data widely available for statistical analysis and machine learning can provide a broad range of benefits. However, the results of analyses of private data can lead to devastating disclosure of sensitive information. We face two seemingly conflicting goals: gaining the benefits of machine learning based on private data, and protecting the privacy of the individuals whose data is collected. How can we achieve them both? Straightforward approaches to deal with the privacy problem such as data anonymization are at best unreliable: the last decade has seen a string of attacks that recover personal information from supposedly \"anonymized\" data. Based on my work, I will show how to efficiently achieve both goals in a rigorous and provable manner. I will describe efficient algorithms, with optimal accuracy and rigorous privacy guarantees, for solving a broad range of machine learning problems. The privacy guarantees of these algorithms are in the form of differential privacy: a rigorous notion of statistical data privacy. These algorithms cover various applications in both models of private data analysis: the centralized model (with trusted curator) and the distributed model (with untrusted curator). Some of these algorithms have been implemented and deployed in industry. Part of my research efforts have been also devoted to understanding and revealing the connections between the notions of privacy and learning. My work characterizes the role of privacy \u2014 as a strong stability condition \u2014 in preventing overfitting even when data is analyzed adaptively. I will highlight this fundamental connection between privacy and machine learning, which shows a surprising harmony between these seemingly opposite notions.

However, in a large-scale distributed system, many things can go wrong: routers can be misconfigured, programs can be buggy, and computers can be compromised by an attacker. To investigate these problems, system administrators need to play the role of 'part-time detectives'. Their tasks would be much easier if there were a way for them to ask the system to explain certain events, such as 'Why was this particular route chosen?'. My work leverages data provenance - a concept from the database community - to enable distributed systems to offer such explanations. At a high level, provenance tracks causality between network states and events, and produces a detailed, structured explanation of any event of interest. Such information can be a helpful starting point when investigating a variety of problems, ranging from benign misconfigurations to malicious attacks. In this talk, I will present one technique in detail that can accurately pinpoint the root causes of problems by comparing the provenance of 'correct' and 'incorrect' events. I will then give an overview of my other work on network provenance, including an extension of provenance to repair network programs, and an application of secure provenance to the Internet's data plane.

Compared with convex optimization, it enjoys superior statistical accuracy, computational efficiency, and modeling flexibility in numerous modern settings. However, the empirical success of nonconvex optimization largely eludes the reach of classical statistical and optimization frameworks, which prohibits us from designing more efficient algorithms in a principled manner. In this talk, I will illustrate how statistical thinking enables us to harness the power of nonconvex optimization. In specific, I will present an algorithmic framework for exploiting the latent geometry induced by the randomness of data. By integrating three new global exploration meta-algorithms \u2014 namely, homotopy continuation, tightening after relaxation, and noise regularization \u2014 with local search heuristics \u2014 such as the variants of gradient descent \u2014 this unified framework leads to new nonconvex optimization algorithms for a broad variety of challenging learning problems. In particular, these algorithms enjoy provably optimal statistical accuracy and computational efficiency, and moreover, lead to new scientific discoveries. Time permitting, I will discuss an interesting \u201cmore data, less computation\u201d phenomenon, which arises from nonconvex optimization, but generalizes to even more algorithms.

Each packet, potentially carrying information that users would rather keep private, is exposed to a network infrastructure operated by a number of third parties the user may not trust and likely cannot even identify. In some cases, the user may not even trust the recipient. Techniques exist to protect user privacy, but they typically do so at the expense of other desirable properties. For example, anonymity services like Tor hide a packet's true sender, but weaken accountability by making it difficult for network administrators or law enforcement to track down malicious senders. Similarly, encryption hides application data from third parties, but prevents the use of middleboxes---devices that process packets in the network to improve performance (like caches) or security (like intrusion detection systems). In this talk, I\u2019ll present techniques for managing these \"Privacy vs. X\" conflicts, including a new network architecture that re-thinks basic networking building blocks like packet source addresses and new secure communication protocols that explicitly balance data privacy with the benefits of middleboxes. Bio: David is a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is advised by Peter Steenkiste.

In this talk, I will describe two projects on learning from weak supervision.\u00a0 First, I will discuss work on learning\u00a0combinatory categorial grammars (CCGs) from incomplete information.\u00a0 In particular, I will show how universal, intrinsic properties of the\u00a0CCG\u00a0formalism can be encoded as priors and used to guide the learning of supertaggers and parsers.\u00a0 These universal priors can, in turn, be combined with corpus-specific knowledge derived from limited amounts of available annotation to further improve performance.\u00a0 Second, I will present work on learning to automatically transcribe historical documents that feature heavy use of code-switching and\u00a0non-standard orthographies that include obsolete spellings, inconsistent diacritic use, typos, and archaic shorthands.\u00a0 Our state-of-the-art model is able to induce language-specific probabilistic mappings from language model data with standard orthography to the document-specific orthography on the page by jointly modeling both variant-preserving and normalized transcriptions.\u00a0 I will conclude with a discussion of how our work has opened up new avenues of research for scholars in the digital humanities, with a focus on transcribing books printed in Mexico in the 1500s.

One of the key issues for scientists who work with large datasets is efficient visualization of their data to extract patterns, observe anomalies, and debug their workflows. Though a variety of visualization tools exist to help people make sense of their data, these tools often rely on database management systems (or DBMSs)\u00a0for data processing and storage;\u00a0and unfortunately,\u00a0DBMSs fail\u00a0to\u00a0process the data fast enough to support a fluid,\u00a0interactive\u00a0visualization experience. My work blends optimization techniques from databases and methodology from HCI and\u00a0visualization in order to support interactive and iterative\u00a0exploration of large datasets. In this talk, I will discuss Sculpin, a visual exploration system that learns user exploration patterns automatically, and exploits these patterns to pre-fetch data ahead of users as they explore.\u00a0I will show that Sculpin's pre-fetching techniques provide significant performance benefits compared to existing systems. I will then discuss our ongoing work with Sculpin, which aims to avoid wasting computational resources, while still providing a fluid, interactive exploration experience for users. To do this, we combine data-prefetching with incremental data processing and visualization-focused caching optimizations, and incorporate these techniques in Sculpin to further boost performance.

Unfortunately, life rarely gives us datasets that are curated and well defined enough to directly apply many of the great tools being developed by the wider community. One often spends the first few weeks (sometimes months) trying to figure out how to store data, deal with inconsistencies in the dataset and determine which algorithm (or set of algorithms) will be best suited for their application.\u00a0 Larger, faster and messier datasets such as those from IoT sensors, medical devices or autonomous vehicles only compound these issues. These challenges, often referred to as the 3 V\u2019s of Big Data, require new tools for data management and data cleaning/pre-processing. In this talk I will describe a few tools developed at MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory and CSAIL to address these challenges. The first is the BigDAWG polystore system. The BigDAWG system allows users to mix and match database technologies in order to support diverse data management operations. For example, in a single application, one may have pieces of a dataset in a relational database, a key-value store and an array database. This allows users to develop complex analytics that leverage highly efficient underlying data stores. The second tool I will discuss is Graphulo \u2013 a toolbox that allows people to perform graph operations directly in key-value store databases such as Apache Accumulo. For both, I will describe performance and future research avenues. Bio: Dr. Vijay Gadepally is a senior member of the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and CSAIL. Vijay's research is in the area of high performance computing, big data/IoT systems, security, analytics, and advanced database technologies.

In 2017, Vijay received the Early Career Technical Achievement Award at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and was named to AFCEA's inaugural 40 under 40 list.

Current machine learning systems, however, assume that training and test data follow the same, or similar, distributions, and do not consider active adversaries manipulating either distribution. Recent work has demonstrated that motivated adversaries can circumvent anomaly detection or classification models at test time through evasion attacks, or can inject well-crafted malicious instances into training data to induce errors in classification through poisoning attacks. In addition, by undermining the integrity of learning systems, the privacy of users' data can also be compromised. In this talk, I will describe my recent research addressing evasion attacks, poisoning attacks, and privacy problems for machine learning systems in adversarial environments. The key approach is to utilize game theoretic analysis and model the interactions between an intelligent adversary and a machine learning system as a Stackelberg game, allowing us to design robust learning strategies which explicitly account for an adversary\u2019s optimal response. I'll briefly discuss human subject experiments that support the results of mathematical models, and I will also introduce a real world malware detection system deployed based on adversarial machine learning analysis.

Eighteenth Ave (EA) Columbus, Ohio 43210 Representation, optimization and generalization in deep learning Deep neural networks have improved state-of-the-art performance for prediction problems across an impressive range of application areas, and they have become a central ingredient in AI systems. This talk considers factors that affect their performance, describing some recent results in two directions. First, we investigate the impact of depth on representation and optimization properties of these networks. We focus on deep residual networks, which have been widely adopted for computer vision applications because they exhibit fast training, even for very deep networks. We show that as the depth of these networks increases, they are able to represent a smooth invertible map with a simpler representation at each layer, and that this implies a desirable property of the functional optimization landscape that arises from regression with deep function compositions: stationary points are global optima. Second, we consider the generalization behavior of deep networks, that is, how their performance on training data compares to predictive accuracy. In particular, we aim to understand how to measure the complexity of functions computed by these networks. For multiclass classification problems, we present a margin-based generalization bound that scales with a certain margin-normalized \"spectral complexity,\" involving the product of the spectral norms of the weight matrices in the network. We show how the bound gives insight into the observed performance of these networks in practical problems. Joint work with Steve Evans and Phil Long, and with Matus Telgarsky and Dylan Foster.

Then, I will introduce Mimir's declarative approach to uncertainty in data, which allows it to decouple query processing from more mechanical concerns\u00a0like how to present uncertainty in query results, or which algorithms to use.

A common task related to such matrices is to approximate them with a low-rank matrix, for efficiency or statistical inference; spectral clustering, kernel PCA, manifold learning, and Gaussian process regression can all involve this task. Given a square n by n matrix A, target rank k, and error parameter epsilon, we show how to find a PSD matrix B of rank k, such that the Frobenius norm of A-B is within a 1+epsilon factor of best possible; our algorithm needs O(nnz(A) + n*poly(k/epsilon)) time to do this, where nnz(A) is the number of nonzero entries of A. We also show how to find such a rank-k matrix PSD B of the form CUC^T, where the O(k/eps) columns of C are a subset of those of A, with a similar runtime. Joint work with David Woodruff.

However it is difficult to use those procedures \"off-the-shelf\" because they have to be properly tuned to the particular application. In this talk, we present some \"adaptive\" regression procedures, i.e. procedures which self-tune, optimally, to the unknown parameters of the problem at hand. We consider regression on a general metric space X of unknown dimension, where the output Y is given as f(x) + noise. We are interested in adaptivity at any input point x in X: the algorithm must self-tune to the unknown \"local\" parameters of the problem at x. The most important such parameters, are (1) the unknown smoothness of f, and (2) the unknown intrinsic dimension, both defined over a neighborhood of x. Existing results on adaptivity have typically treated these two problem parameters separately, resulting in methods that solve only part of the self-tuning problem. Using various regressors as an example, we first develop insight\u00a0 into tuning to unknown dimension. We then present an approach for kernel regression which allows simultaneous adaptivity to smoothness and dimension locally at a point x. This latest approach combines intuition for tuning to dimension, and intuition from so-called Lepski's methods for tuning to smoothness. The overall approach is likely to generalize to other nonparametric methods. Bio: Samory Kpotufe is Assistant Professor in the ORFE department at Princeton University.

Discovering the limitations of differential privacy yields insights as to what analyses are incompatible with privacy and why. These insights further aid the quest to discover optimal privacy-preserving algorithms. In this talk, I will give examples of how both follow from new understandings of the structure of differential privacy. I will first describe negative results for private data analysis via a connection to cryptographic objects called fingerprinting codes. These results show that an (asymptotically) optimal way to solve natural high-dimensional tasks is to decompose them into many simpler tasks. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss concentrated differential privacy, a framework which enables more accurate analyses by precisely capturing how simpler tasks compose.

Specifically, we will show that these well-known algorithms avoid saddle points for almost all initializations. Our techniques provide a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a wide variety of classic optimization algorithms in non-convex optimization. The second result is about Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm (MWU) on learning in games. We shall show that classic MWU converges to exact Nash equilibria for any congestion game and that this convergence result does not carry over for the exponential MWU variant, in which chaotic behavior might occur. The connecting thread is that both results can be analyzed from a dynamical systems\u2019 perspective. Bio: Dr Ioannis Panageas is a MIT postdoctoral Fellow.

Thu, Jan 25 2018, 4pm Yu Su 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave, Columbus, Ohio 43210 Bridging the Gap between Human and Data with AI Data-driven problem solving and decision making is one of the most common activities in daily life. For example, doctors make diagnostic decisions by gathering information from patient inquiry and examination. The rise of big data, such as electronic medical records and digitized scientific literature, bears the promise of bringing unprecedented opportunities for better-informed decision making. However, as data becomes more and more massive and heterogeneous, standing in stark contrast to this promise is the quickly growing gap between users and data: Accessing and analyzing even very simple data requires extensive training, which is not economic for casual users who only use data on an occasional and on-demand basis. In this talk, I will discuss our research efforts of developing AI techniques to bridge the gap between users and data. In the first part of the talk, I will discuss how to construct knowledge bases, which contain structured knowledge about entities and their relationships, from massive unstructured texts, and present a new approach to build more robust relation extractors using global statistics collected from the entire corpus. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss how to construct natural language interfaces to various kinds of data such as knowledge bases and relational databases, so that users can query data using natural language questions instead of writing SQL-like formal queries. I will discuss in depth our explorations on the benchmarking and portability issues of natural language interface.

The worst case theory for nonconvex optimization is dismal: in general, even guaranteeing a local minimum is NP hard. However, heuristic algorithms are often surprisingly effective in practice. The ability of nonconvex heuristics to find high-quality solutions remains largely mysterious. In this talk, I will present examples of nonconvex problems that can be provably and efficiently solved to global optimum, using simple numerical optimization methods. These include variants of problems of learning sparsifying basis for subspaces (a.k.a. sparse dictionary learning), and image reconstruction from certain types of phaseless measurements (a.k.a. phase retrieval). Those problems possess characteristic structures, in which (i) all local minima are global, (ii) the energy landscape does not have any ``flat\u2019\u2019 saddle points. For each of the aforementioned problems, the benign geometric structure allows us to obtain novel performance guarantees. To enrich the framework is an ongoing research effort, I will discuss several open problems and future directions.

In the past few years, with the accessibility to large-scale data and the advance of machine learning algorithms, vision and language understanding has had significant progress for constrained environments. However, it remains challenging for unconstrained environments in the wild where the intelligent system needs to tackle unseen objects and unfamiliar language usage that it has not been trained on. Transfer learning, which aims to transfer and adapt the learned knowledge from the training environment to a different but related test environment has thus emerged as a promising paradigm to remedy the difficulty. In this talk, I will present my recent work on transfer learning towards intelligent systems in the wild. I will begin with zero-shot learning, which aims to expand the learned knowledge from seen objects, of which we have training data, to unseen objects, of which we have no training data. I will present an algorithm SynC that can construct classifiers of any object class given its semantic description, even without training data, followed by a comprehensive study on how to apply it to different environments. I will then describe an adaptive visual question answering framework that builds upon the insight of zero-shot learning and can further adapt its knowledge to the new environment given limited information. I will finish my talk with some directions for future research. Bio: Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao is a Computer Science PhD candidate at University of Southern California, working with Fei Sha.

There are different types of biometric data used in a variety of applications such as biometric recognition including verification and identification. Because of the highly sensitive nature of biometric data, its protection is essential during biometric computations. Based on the computations that need to be carried out and the type of biometric data, there is a need for application-specific privacy preserving solutions. These solutions can be provided by developing secure biometric computations in a way that no information gets revealed during the protocol execution. In some biometric applications (e.g. verification and identification), data is distributed amongst different parties engaged in computations. In some other applications, the execution of computations is bounded by the computational power of the parties, motivating the use of cloud or external servers. In both these cases, 1) there is a higher risk for sensitive data to be disclosed, making secure biometric protocols a prominent need for such practical applications, 2) it is more challenging to develop novel and efficient solutions for these computational settings, making the design of secure biometric protocols a research-worthy effort. In this talk, Fattaneh focuses on three different biometric modalities (Voice, DNA, Fingerprint) which require various computational settings. The proposed solutions consider the nature of computational setting (two-party and multi-party settings) of biometric applications in practice and efficiently protect the data during the computations. In addition, the secure protocols and building blocks which will be presented are general and can be used for other applications where the same data types and settings are used.

Indeed, over the past century the fields of statistics and machine learning have amassed a vast understanding of various learning tasks like clustering, classification, and regression using simple real valued vectors. However, we do not live in a world of simple objects. From the contact lists we keep, the sound waves we hear, and the distribution of cells we have, complex objects such as sets, distributions, sequences, and functions are all around us. Furthermore, with ever-increasing data collection capacities at our disposal, not only are we collecting more data, but richer and more bountiful complex data are becoming the norm. In this presentation we analyze regression problems where input covariates, and possibly output responses, are probability distribution functions from a nonparametric function class. Such problems cover a large range of interesting applications including learning the dynamics of cosmological particles and general tasks like parameter estimation. However, previous nonparametric estimators for functional regression problems scale badly computationally with the number of input/output pairs in a data-set. Yet, given the complexity of distributional data it may be necessary to consider large data-sets in order to achieve a low estimation risk. To address this issue, we present two novel scalable nonparametric estimators: the Double-Basis Estimator (2BE) for distribution-to-real regression problems; and the Triple-Basis Estimator (3BE) for distribution-to-distribution regression problems. Both the 2BE and 3BE can scale to massive data-sets. We show an improvement of several orders of magnitude in terms of prediction speed and a reduction in error over previous estimators in various synthetic and real-world data-sets. Bio: Junier Oliva is a Ph.D. candidate in the Machine Learning Department at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. His main research interest is to build algorithms that understand data at an aggregate, holistic level. Currently, he is working to push machine learning past the realm of operating over static finite vectors, and start reasoning ubiquitously with complex, dynamic collections like sets and sequences. Moreover, he is interested in exporting concepts from learning on distributional and functional inputs to modern techniques in deep learning, and vice-versa. He is also developing methods for analyzing massive datasets, both in terms of instances and covariates. Prior to beginning his Ph.D. program, he received his B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.

Unfortunately, there is a catch. Machine learning algorithms have traditionally been\u00a0designed independently of the systems that acquire data. As a result, there is a fundamental disconnect between their promise and their real-world applicability. An urgent need has therefore emerged for integrating the design of\u00a0learning and acquisition systems. In this talk, I will present an approach for addressing this learning-acquisition disconnect using interactive, multi-fidelity, and compressive machine learning methods. As an example, I will consider the problem of learning graphical\u00a0model structure in high-dimensional data. This will highlight how traditional (open loop) methods do not take into account data acquisition constraints that arise in applications ranging from sensor networks to calcium imaging\u00a0of the brain. I will then demonstrate how one can close this loop using techniques from interactive machine learning. I will conclude the talk with some directions for future exploration that align with this exciting research agenda.

It is an analytic visual act of seeing. For example, the visual queries for finding routes on a road map involve discovering connected lines connecting two map locations. A visual query on a weather map might be as simple as discovering the temperature by matching a color to a temperature key, or as complex as understanding the pattern of winds at a weather front. This talk will give an overview of the way visual queries fit within the visual thinking process as well as a look at the how designs can be optimized with visual queries in mind. Colin Ware has a special interest in applying theories of perception to the design of data visualizations. He has advanced degrees in both computer science (MMath, Waterloo) and in the psychology of perception (PhD,Toronto). He has published over 170 articles ranging from rigorously scientific contributions to the Journal of Physiology, Behavior and Vision Research to applications oriented articles in the fields of data visualization and human-computer interaction. His book Information Visualization: Perception for Design is now in its third edition.\u00a0 His book, Visual Thinking for Design, appeared in 2008. Ware also likes to build practical visualization systems. Fledermaus, a commercial 3D geospatial visualization system widely used in oceanography, was developed from his initial prototypes. His trackPlot software is being used by marine mammal scientists and his flowVis2D software is serving images on NOAA websites.

Mohan Distinguished Guest Speaker: Dr. C. Mohan IBM Fellow, IBM Almaden Research Center All dates for this event occur in the past. Tue, Oct 24 2017, 3pm Dr. C. Mohan 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210 New Era in Distributed Computing with Blockchains and Databases A new era is emerging in the world of distributed computing with the growing popularity of blockchains (shared, replicated and distributed ledgers) and the associated databases as a way of integrating inter-organizational work. Originally, the concept of a distributed ledger was invented as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. But the adoption and further adaptation of it for use in the commercial or permissioned environments is what is of utmost interest to me and hence will be the focus of this keynote. Computer companies like IBM and Microsoft, and many key players in different vertical industry segments have recognized the applicability of blockchains in environments other than cryptocurrencies. IBM did some pioneering work by architecting and implementing Fabric, and then open sourcing it. Now Fabric is being enhanced via the Hyperledger Consortium as part of The Linux Foundation. A few of the other efforts include Enterprise Ethereum, R3 Corda and BigchainDB. While there is no standard in the blockchain space currently, all the ongoing efforts involve some combination of database, transaction, encryption, consensus and other distributed systems technologies. Some of the application areas in which blockchain pilots are being carried out are: smart contracts, supply chain management, know your customer, derivatives processing and provenance management. In this talk, I will survey some of the ongoing blockchain projects with respect to their architectures in general and their approaches to some specific technical areas. I will focus on how the functionality of traditional and modern data stores are being utilized or not utilized in the different blockchain projects. I will also distinguish how traditional distributed database management systems have handled replication and how blockchain systems do it. Since most of the blockchain efforts are still in a nascent state, the time is right for database and other distributed systems researchers and practitioners to get more deeply involved to focus on the numerous open problems. Bio: Dr. C. Mohan has been an IBM researcher for 35 years in the database area, impacting numerous IBM and non-IBM products, the research and academic communities, and standards, especially with his invention of the ARIES family of database locking and recovery algorithms, and the Presumed Abort commit protocol. This IBM (1997), and ACM/IEEE (2002) Fellow has also served as the IBM India Chief Scientist for 3 years (2006-2009). In addition to receiving the ACM SIGMOD Innovations Award (1996), the VLDB 10 Year Best Paper Award (1999) and numerous IBM awards, Mohan was elected to the US and Indian National Academies of Engineering (2009), and was named an IBM Master Inventor (1997). This Distinguished Alumnus of IIT Madras (1977) received his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin (1981). He is an inventor of 50 patents. He is currently focused on Blockchain, Big Data and HTAP technologies. Since 2016, he has been a Distinguished Visiting Professor of China\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. He has served on the advisory board of IEEE Spectrum, and on numerous conference and journal boards. Mohan is a frequent speaker in North America, Europe and India, and has given talks in 40 countries. He is very active on social media and has a huge network of followers.

However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good idea and a realized one. This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and experimentation for applications operating at city scale. To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing. Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints. We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its ability to support sensing applications. We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments, enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health. Bio: Josh Adkins is a second year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley where he works with Professor Prabal Dutta and Lab11. His research focuses on the deployment of ubiquitous sensor systems, and he hopes to lower the burden of deploying, programming, and retasking dense networks of these devices.

Sound solutions are needed, as \"ad hoc\" approaches have resulted in several high-profile failures. In this talk, I will illustrate how privacy can be unwittingly compromised -- i.e., sensitive information can be leaked by seemingly innocuous \"anonymized\" or aggregate data. I will then show how to avoid these pitfalls using the framework of differential privacy. Differential privacy is an information-theoretic measure of algorithmic stability that translates into a robust privacy guarantee and which also permits us to design algorithms to perform sophisticated statistical analyses. Privacy turns out to be intimately related to generalization in machine learning. In particular, a differentially private algorithm is guaranteed to not \"overfit\" its data, meaning that any statistical conclusions extend to the underlying distribution from which the data was drawn. I will discuss this connection and explain how it is especially useful for adaptive data analysis, namely when one dataset is used over and over again and each successive analysis is informed by the outcome of previous analyses. Bio: Thomas Steinke is a postdoctoral researcher\u00a0at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. In 2016, he graduated from Harvard University with a PhD in Computer Science advised by Salil Vadhan and prior to that he completed a MSc and a BSc(Hons) in New Zealand. His research interests include providing rigorous tools for privacy-preserving data analysis and statistically valid adaptive data analysis, as well as pseudorandomness.

Thu, Mar 3 2016, 4pm Ce Zhang 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210 DeepDive: A Data Management System for Machine Learning Workloads Many pressing questions in science are macroscopic: they require scientists to consult information expressed in a wide range of resources, many of which are not organized in a structured relational form. Knowledge base construction (KBC) is the process of populating a knowledge base, i.e., a relational database storing factual information, from unstructured inputs. KBC holds the promise of facilitating a range of macroscopic sciences by making information accessible to scientists. One key challenge in building a high-quality KBC system is that developers must often deal with data that are both diverse in type and large in size. Further complicating the scenario is that these data need to be manipulated by both relational operations and state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. My research focuses on building a data management system for machine learning workloads with the goal to help this complex process of building KBC systems. The system I build is called DeepDive, whose ultimate goal is to allow scientists to build a KBC system, and machine learning systems in general, by declaratively specifying domain knowledge without worrying about any algorithmic, performance, or scalability issues. DeepDive has been used by users without machine learning expertise in a number of domains from paleobiology to genomics to anti-human trafficking. In this talk, I will describe the DeepDive framework, its applications, and underlying techniques we developed to speed up a range of machine learning workloads by up to two orders of magnitude. Ce is a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at Stanford University. He is working with Christopher R\u00e9 on data management and database systems.

Developers depend on reproducing bugs to diagnose them. Traditionally, systems that attempt to reproduce bugs record fine-grained events that lead to failures. Alas, recording incurs high runtime overhead, making existing techniques unsuitable in production. In this talk, I will discuss two techniques that do not require fine-grained and expensive recording. The first technique is failure sketching, which produces easy-to-understand explanations of events that lead to a failure. I will then introduce Lazy Diagnosis, a hybrid dynamic-static interprocedural pointer and type analysis for diagnosing the root causes of bugs. Lazy Diagnosis uses modern hardware support and a surprising property of multithreaded programs in the real world to eliminate scalability problems in Failure Sketching. We are in the process of deploying our lazy diagnosis prototype in hundreds of millions of computers. Finally, I will discuss how our findings can be used to build more efficient in-production bug detection and record/replay techniques.

An Interpolation Perspective on Modern Machine Learning Speaker: Mikhail Belkin, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University Abstract: A striking feature of modern supervised machine learning is its consistent use of techniques that nearly interpolate the data.\u00a0 Deep networks\u00a0 often containing several orders of magnitude more parameters than data points, are trained to obtain near zero error on the training set. Yet, at odds with most theory,\u00a0 they show excellent test performance. In this talk I will discuss and give some historical context for the phenomenon of interpolation (zero training loss). I will show how it provides a new perspective on machine learning and statistical inference forcing us to rethink some commonly held assumptions and point to the significant gaps in our understanding, even in the simplest settings, of why such classifiers generalize well. I will also demonstrate the power of this point of view by describing its advantages for optimization and showing how its simplicity can be used to\u00a0 construct very efficient and theoretically sound methods for training large-scale kernel machines.

Until recently, we completely agreed with this CW. However, there have been some major advances in discrete and even purely finitary examples of independence from ZFC that are now sufficiently basic and transparent that we believe that the possibility of P = NP and related problems being independent of ZFC is at least worthy of consideration. We will discuss these new natural examples, and present one of them, Maximal Emulation Stability, particularly slowly and carefully, in order to engage and hopefully interact with an audience of computer scientists and other scholars. In addition, an older example of ours is being championed by Gill Williamson as a possible vehicle for establishing the independence of P = NP from ZFC. Event Highlight Tue, May 29 2018, 3:30pm",

Fri, Oct 27 2017, 3pm Lorenzo Rosasco DL 480 2015 Neil Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210 (Un)conventional regularization for efficient large scale machine learning Regularization is classically designed by\u00a0\u00a0penalizing or imposing explicit constraints to an empirical objective function. This approach can be derived from different perspectives and has optimal statistical guarantees. However, it\u00a0\u00a0postpones\u00a0\u00a0computational\u00a0\u00a0considerations to a separate analysis. In large scale scenarios, considering independently statistical and numerical aspects often leads to prohibitive and unrealistic computational requirements. It is then natural\u00a0\u00a0to ask whether different regularization principles exist or can be derived to encompass both aspects at once. In this talk, we\u00a0\u00a0will present several ideas in this direction, showing how procedures typically\u00a0\u00a0developed to perform efficient computations can often be seen as a form of implicit regularization. We will discuss how iterative optimization of an empirical objective\u00a0\u00a0leads to regularization, and analyze the effect of acceleration and stochastic approximations. We will further discuss the regularization effect of sketching/subsampling methods by drawing a connection to classical regularization projection methods common in inverse problems. We will show how these forms of implicit regularization obtain optimal statistical guarantees, with dramatically reduced computational properties.

We will discuss two manifestations of the expressiveness of these queries in machine learning and complexity theory (a more detailed overview is given below). Both manifestations are based on the notion of \"inference dimension\u201d\u00a0that can be viewed as another instance of the fruitful link\u00a0between machine learning and discrete mathematics - a link dating back to the discovery of the VC dimension. 1. Active classification with comparison queries [Kane, Lovett, Moran, Zhang FOCS \u201917] Active learning is a model for semi-supervised learning that captures situations in which unlabeled data is abundant and manually labelling it is expensive. We consider an extension of active learning in which the learning algorithm may ask the annotator to compare the distances of two examples from the boundary of their label-class.\u00a0For example, in a recommendation system application (say for restaurants), the annotator may be asked whether she liked or disliked a specific restaurant (a label query);\u00a0or which one of two restaurants did she like more (a comparison query).\u00a0We prove that the usage of comparison queries leads to an exponential improvement in the query complexity of some well studied problems.\u00a0Specifically, for the class of half-spaces, we show that under natural assumptions, such as large margin or bounded bit-description of the input examples,\u00a0it is possible to reveal all the labels of a sample of size n using approximately O(logn) queries. 2. Nearly optimal linear decision trees for k-SUM and related problems [Kane, Lovett, Moran STOC \u201918] We use the above framework to construct linear decision trees for a variety of decision problems in combinatorics and discrete geometry.\u00a0For example, for any k, we construct linear decision trees that solve the k-SUM problem on n elements using O(nk log n) linear queries.\u00a0Moreover, the queries we use are comparison queries, which compare the sums of two k-subsets;\u00a0when viewed as linear queries, comparison queries are 2k-sparse and have only {\u22121,+1} coefficients.\u00a0We give similar constructions for sorting sumsets A+B and for solving the SUBSET-SUM problem, both with optimal number of queries, up to poly-logarithmic terms. Based on joint works with Daniel Kane, Shachar Lovett, and Jiapeng Zhang. Bio: Shay Moran is a Post-doc at Princeton University and at the Institute for Advanced at Princeton.

In this talk, we present novel formulation for each of these challenges. First, I will cover ultra-fine-grained entity typing: a new formalism for recognizing what types of entities are being mentioned, in context-dependent ways. While previous work relied on small inventories of entity types, our new task covers thousands of fine-grained types, comes with a natural source of weak-supervision, and improves performance on existing benchmarks. In the second half of the talk, I will introduce a new QA task \u2014 Question Answering in Context (QuAC) where we simulate information seeking dialogs composed of a sequence of questions that build on each other. This formalism allows for more open-ended, contextual questions that could not be asked in existing single-turn QA settings, greatly reducing the prevalence of simple factoid questions. Together, these works expand the scope of questions that can be answered with the next generation of machine reading systems. Bio: Eunsol Choi is a PhD candidate in the Paul G.

In particular I will talk about the BuckeyeVR project ( http://buckeyevr.osu.edu ) which is being used in select physics, math and engineering courses at OSU. I will also discuss the STEMcoding project which is an OSU-led effort to integrate simple, standards-aligned, browser-based coding activities into high school and early college STEM courses like physics, physical science and math. By releasing activities on youtube ( http://www.youtube.com/c/STEMcoding ) and hourofcode.com, the STEMcoding project aims to compensate for a lack of attention to these areas from national coding initiatives. Both the BuckeyeVR and STEMcoding projects have included a serious educational research component that I will describe. Finally,\u00a0I will provide my perspective on CS education in Ohio as a member of the Ohio Department of Education CS standards committee. Bio: Chris Orban is an assistant professor of physics at Ohio State Marion. He collaborates closely with the Physics Education Research group in the physics department at OSU and he has served on both the science standards committee and the newly-formed computer science standards committee\u00a0with the Ohio Department of Education. His background is in computational physics and high performance computing. Host : Julia Armstrong Event Highlight Thu, Nov 15 2018, 4pm",

To address this challenge, we propose a new computer architecture -- Labeled von Neumann Architecture (LvNA), which enables a new hardware/software interface by introducing a hardware labeling mechanism to convey software\u2019s semantic information such as QoS and security to the underlying hardware. In this talk, I will present LvNA's principles and demonstrate a RISC-V based FPGA prototype (a.k.a. Labeled RISC-V) that has been already open-sourced. I will also share our experiences in an agile approach for chip design with RISC-V and Chisel, which can dramatically improve RTL programming productivity by 10X according to our experiments.

While there exist several solutions to address this type of vulnerability, none of them are sufficiently practical for adoption in production scenarios. Most competitive and recent solutions require object type tracking for checking polymorphic object casts, and all have prohibitively high runtime overhead. The main source of overhead is the need to track the object type during runtime for both polymorphic and non-polymorphic object casts. In this talk, I will present CASTSAN, a C++ object type confusion detection tool for polymorphic objects only, which scales efficiently to large and complex code bases as well as to many concurrent threads. To considerably reduce the object type cast checking overhead, we employ a new technique based on constructing the whole virtual table hierarchy during program compile time. Since CASTSAN does not rely on keeping track of the object type during runtime, the overhead is drastically reduced. Our evaluation results show that complex applications run insignificantly slower when our technique is deployed, thus making CASTSAN a real-world usage candidate. Finally, we envisage that based on our object type confusion detection technique, which relies on ordered virtual tables (vtables), even non-polymorphic object casts could be precisely handled by constructing auxiliary non-polymorphic function table hierarchies for static classes as well.

New data collection technology, such as GPS, high definition cameras, UAVs, genotyping, and crowdsourcing, are generating data about wild populations that are orders of magnitude richer than any previously collected. Unfortunately, in this domain as in many others, our ability to analyze data lags substantially behind our ability to collect it. In this talk I will show how computational approaches can be part of every stage of the scientific process of understanding animal sociality, from intelligent data collection (crowdsourcing photographs and identifying individual animals from photographs by stripes and spots - Wildbook.org) to hypothesis formulation (by designing a novel computational framework for analysis of dynamic social networks), and provide scientific insight into collective behavior of zebras, baboons, and other social animals. Bio: Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she heads the Computational Population Biology Lab. As a computational ecologist, her research is at the unique intersection of computer science, wildlife biology, and social sciences. She creates computational solutions to address questions such as how environmental factors affect the behavior of social animals (humans included). Berger-Wolf is also a director and co-founder of the conservation software non-profit Wild Me, home of the Wildbook project, which enabled the first ever full census of entire species, the endangered Grevy's zebra in Kenya, using photographs from ordinary citizens.

Different forms of this problem naturally arise in distributed learning and optimization:\u00a0it is equivalent to Distributed Linear Program (LP) Feasibility -- a basic task in distributed optimization,\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0it is tightly linked to Distributed Learning of Halfdpaces in R^d.\u00a0In communication complexity theory,\u00a0CSD can be viewed as a geometric interpolation\u00a0between the classical problems of Set Disjointness (when d>= n-1) and Greater-Than (when d=1). We establish a nearly tight bound of ~Theta(d log n) on the communication complexity of learning halfspaces in R^d.\u00a0For Convex Set Disjointness (and the equivalent task of distributed LP feasibility)\u00a0we derive upper and lower bounds of tilde O(d^2\\log n) and~Omega(d\\log n).\u00a0These results improve upon several previous works in distributed learning and optimization. Unlike typical works in communication complexity, the main technical contribution of this work lies in the upper bounds.\u00a0In particular, our protocols are based on a Container Lemma for Halfspaces and on two variants of Caratheodory's Theorem,\u00a0\u00a0which may be of independent interest.\u00a0These geometric statements are used by our protocols to provide a compressed summary of the players' input.

However, memory caches are expensive, both in terms of power and operating costs. It is thus important to dynamically scale such caches in response to workload variations. Unfortunately, stateful systems, such as Memcached, are not elastic in nature. The performance loss that follows a scaling action can severely impact latencies and lead to SLO violations. In this talk, I will present ElMem, an elastic Memcached system that we designed to mitigate post-scaling performance loss by proactively migrating hot data between nodes. The key enabler of our work is an efficient algorithm, FuseCache, that migrates the optimal amount of hot data to minimize performance loss. Our experimental results on OpenStack, across several workload traces, show that ElMem elastically scales Memcached while reducing the postscaling performance degradation by about 90%. Our ElMem work received the Best Student Paper award at ICDCS 2018. Bio: Anshul Gandhi is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University.

We have ported the OpenStack cloud platform to Pileus, finding that we can systematically prevent compromised cloud services from attacking other users\u2019 cloud operations with less than 3% additional operation latency. \u00a0I will also discuss how to apply the lessons learned here to emerging microservice and edge computing platforms.

Thu, Oct 4 2018, 4pm Xia Ning 480 Dreese Labs 2015 Neil Ave, Columbus, Ohio 43210 Computational Approaches toward Better Drugs Drug development and responsible drug use represent critical issues for health care. Drug development has been extremely costly and of extremely low success rate. Even after successful development and FDA approval, many marketed drugs do not introduce equal efficacy on different patients, or they may induce unexpected side effects on patients. In this talk, we will demonstrate how computational approaches can help accelerate drug development, facilitate precision drug selection and perform post-market pharmacovigilance. In specific, we will discuss a new ranking framework and ranking methods to prioritize drug candidates when multiple criteria are considered (e.g., drug bioactivity and selectivity). We will also discuss a new ranking-based approach to selecting effective cancer drugs for different patients, and new computational methods to predict drug-drug interactions and their induced side effects.

In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured neural network for learning propagation dynamics in Twitter cascades. The network builds upon a Tree-LSTM that is carefully engineered to the structure of online information cascades. The resulting Tree-LSTM overcomes inherent limitations from feature engineering, since it learns propagation features along the complete cascade. Its effectiveness is demonstrated based on a classification task where the veracity of 2,156 Twitter cascades is predicted. We improve the detection performance in terms of AUC over the status quo with cascade features by 4.1%.

Yet, much of the scholarship to this point has focused on developing AI that can explain itself (e.g., via interpretability tools), under the assumption that people perfectly internalize this information and, as a result, are able to better interact with their AI counterpart. In my work, I argue that helping people understand AI is as much a human problem as a technical one: it is bound by both people\u2019s information processing capabilities and the quality of information AI can provide. I study human-AI interaction in the context of ML-based decision-support systems. In this talk, I will discuss my work that has focused on identifying the challenges in interpretability tool use, observing cognitive and social heuristics as a barrier to people's understanding of ML models. These heuristics serve as automatic shortcuts that make people's decision-making tasks easier and faster to accomplish, without having to reason about the information being presented. Looking ahead, my goal is to quantitatively characterize these heuristics and attempt to combat them via solutions grounded in adversarial design, a type of political design that relies on productive contestation and dissensus. My research agenda argues for the inclusion of a human-centered perspective at all stages of developing novel interpretability approaches and tools. Bio: Harman Kaur is a PhD candidate in both the department of Computer Science and the School of Information at the University of Michigan, where she is advised by Eric Gilbert and Cliff Lampe. Her research interests lie in human-AI collaboration and interpretable ML. Specifically, she studies interpretability tools from a human-centered perspective and designs solutions to support the bounded nature of human rationality in the context of ML-based decision-support systems. She has published several papers at top-tier human-computer interaction venues, such as CHI, CSCW, and IUI. Her work has won Best Paper Honorable Mention awards at CHI and IUI. She has also completed several internships at Microsoft Research and the Allen Institute for AI. Prior to Michigan, Harman received a BS in Computer Science\u00a0from the University of Minnesota.

Tue, Oct 26 2021, 3:30 - 4:30pm Register Here Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor Professor John Martinis, UC Santa Barbara Tuesday, October 26th at 3:30pm The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor.\u00a0 We have used a programmable superconducting processor to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a \"parallel computation\" of 10 million trillion states.\u00a0 For a simple algorithm, our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to run a quantum circuit a million times - the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm. John M. Martinis is a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, where he\u00a0pioneered research on superconducting quantum-bits. Before joining UC Santa Barbara in 2004, he worked at\u00a0CEA France and later at NIST Boulder as a postdoc.\u00a0In 2014, Martinis joined the Google Quantum-AI team to head the effort to build the first useful quantum computer. In the same year,\u00a0he was awarded the London Prize for low-temperature physics research on superconducting qubits.\u00a0In 2019, Martinis and his team published a paper on Nature with title `Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor\u2019, where they presented how they achieved quantum supremacy for the first time using a 53-qubits quantum computer. He is the recipient of the 2021 John Stewart Bell Prize for his Research on Fundamental Issues in Quantum Mechanics and Their Applications.

Plants like dandelions can disperse their seeds over a kilometer in the wind, and small insects like bumblebees can see, smell, communicate, and fly around the world, despite their tiny size. Enabling some of these capabilities for the Internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems would be transformative for applications ranging from large-scale sensor deployments to micro-drones, biological tracking, and robotic implants. In this talk, I will explain how by taking an interdisciplinary approach spanning wireless communication, sensing, and biology, we can create programmable devices for the internet of biological and bio-inspired things. I will present the first battery-free wireless sensors, inspired by dandelion seeds, that can be dispersed by the wind to automate deployment of large-scale sensor networks. I will then discuss how integrating programmable wireless sensors with live animals like bumblebees can enable mobility for IoT devices, and how this technique has been used for real-world applications like tracking invasive \"murder\" hornets. Finally, I will present an energy-efficient insect-scale steerable vision system inspired by animal head motion that can ride on the back of a live beetle and enable tiny terrestrial robots to see.

Motivated by these developments, we seek for theoretical explanations of provable improvements (or the lack thereof) in performance obtained by parallelizing optimization algorithms. In 1994, Nemirovski proved that for low-dimensional optimization problems there is a very limited improvement that could be obtained by parallelization, and furthermore conjectured that no acceleration should be achievable by these means. In this talk, I will present new results showing that in high-dimensional settings no acceleration can be obtained by parallelization, providing strong evidence towards Nemirovski's conjecture.

Wed, May 11 2022, 1:10 - 2:10pm CSE is delighted to announce that Prof. Huan Sun\u2019s paper titled with \u201cCliniQG4QA: Generating Diverse Questions for Domain Adaptation of Clinical Question Answering\u201d has won the Best Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) 2021. This paper was co-authored with Xiang Yue (currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Sun), Xinliang Frederick Zhang (then an undergraduate in CSE and now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan), Ziyu Yao (then a Ph.D. student in CSE and now an assistant professor at George Mason University), Simon Lin (then the Chief Research Information Officer at the Nationwide Children's Hospital and now at the University of California, Riverside). This paper addresses an important problem of domain adaptation of natural language question answering (QA) models. Medical professionals often query over clinical notes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to find information that can support their decision-making. One way to facilitate such clinical information-seeking activities is to train a clinical question answering (CliniQA) system, which inputs a clinical document (e.g., a patient record) as well as a natural question raised by a clinician and extracts a text span from the document as the answer to the question. However, a QA model trained on one dataset often struggles to generalize to new questions and new contexts.\u00a0 In the paper, the authors propose a simple yet effective framework, CliniQG4QA, which leverages automatic question generation to synthesize QA pairs on new clinical contexts and boosts QA models without requiring manual annotations. This study makes a great example of how to adapt general natural language processing (NLP) techniques to specialized domains such as clinical informatics. \u201cWe are very excited to receive this award and it is a great recognition of my students\u2019 hard work and the team collaboration,\u201d said Huan Sun. She has been dedicated to developing natural language interfaces and conversational AI systems with applications to various domains. She said, \u201cThe techniques introduced in this paper could be applied to other use cases beyond clinical question answering.\u201d The IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) has established itself as the premier research conference in bioinformatics and biomedicine. IEEE BIBM 2021 provides a leading forum for disseminating the latest research in bioinformatics and health informatics. It brings together academic and industrial scientists from computer science, biology, chemistry, medicine, mathematics and statistics. Event Highlight Wed, May 11 2022, 1:10 - 2:10pm",

Recently, algorithms have been developed to learn such parsers for many applications, including question answering, information extraction, and robot control. However, each application requires innovations in modeling and learning and we lack semantic parsers that generalize across domains. In this talk, I present a new approach to learning domain independent semantic parsers from indirect supervision, with application to question answering and information extraction for a wide variety of topics, ranging from astronomy to celebrity trivia. The key challenge is to develop new parsing and learning techniques that require very little in-domain data. I will describe a novel two-stage parser that separates (1) a domain-independent, linguistically motivated, parse step from (2) a domain-dependent ontology matching process. This allows a single grammar to be learnt for multiple different domains while also supporting reasoning about meaning in very large ontologies. We show that the two stage parsing approach significantly outperforms competing systems when answering questions with Freebase. We also show that it can be adapted to applications in information extraction, where the key challenge is to automatically determine which subparts of a text actually describe concepts in the target ontology. Finally, I will also give a brief overview of our ongoing work towards even wider scale natural language interfaces and information extraction systems.

The wide variety of potential applications of these platforms include: (i) commercial and residential construction; (ii) logistics; (iii) transportation; (iv) energy production; (iv) inspection; (v) manufacturing in the automotive, aerospace, and heavy industries; and (vi) repair and maintenance, to list just a few. The benefit of dexterous mobile robots can be multiplied by allowing such systems to learn from their operators how to execute tasks and then be able to conduct those tasks on their own in a weakly structured environment. This approach is the province of a platform that we refer to as \u201cCYTAR TM \u201d \u2013 short for Cybernetic Training for Autonomous Robots. Existing robots perform poorly in dynamic and unstructured environments. Traditional machine learning (ML) requires a time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error approach. Existing AI/ML solutions are environment-specific and hard to replicate as conditions change. As a result, many industries cannot benefit from the efficiencies offered by technological advancements. Sarcos\u2019 Cybernetic Training for Autonomous Robots (CYTAR TM ) technology program is focused on bringing autonomy to unstructured workplaces. The CYTAR TM platform is being developed to build on emerging Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI)-powered robotics technologies to enable repair and maintenance, logistics support and, in the long run, the industrial environment of the future where hundreds of networked exoskeletons (XO \u00ae robots)-equipped operators and CYTAR TM humanoid robots work as a team to achieve increased productivity and prevent worker injuries. The talk will provide an overview of robotic systems that combine human intelligence, instincts and judgment with the strength, endurance and precision of machines to (i) augment human performance and awareness and (ii) operate autonomously when trained or remotely controlled by a human operator in unstructured environments.

Yet, today\u2019s technologies remain far from allowing us to perceive most of the world we live in. Despite centuries of seaborne voyaging, more than 95% of our ocean has never been observed or explored. And, at any moment in time, each of us has very little insight into the biological world inside our own bodies. The challenge in perceiving hidden worlds extends beyond ourselves: even the robots we build are limited in their visual perception of the world. In this talk, I will describe new technologies that allow us to decode areas of the physical world that have so far been too remote or difficult to perceive. First, I will describe a new generation of underwater sensor networks that can sense, compute, and communicate without requiring any batteries; our devices enable real-time and ultra-long-term monitoring of ocean conditions (temperature, pressure, coral reefs) with important applications to scientific exploration, climate monitoring, and aquaculture (seafood production). Next, I will talk about new wireless technologies for sensing the human body, both from inside the body (via batteryless micro-implants) as well as from a distance (for contactless cardiovascular and stress monitoring), paving the way for novel diagnostic and treatment methods. Finally, I will highlight our work on extending robotic perception beyond line-of-sight, and how we designed new RF-visual primitives for robotics - including sensing, servoing, navigation, and grasping - to enable new manipulation tasks that were not possible before. The talk will cover how we have designed and built these technologies, and how we work with medical doctors, climatologists, oceanographers, and industry practitioners to deploy them in the real world. I will also highlight the open problems and opportunities for these technologies, and how researchers and engineers can build on our open-source tools to help drive them to their full potential in addressing global challenges in climate, health, and automation.

Fri, Oct 7 2022, 2 - 3pm Vision Talk with Olivier Pfister : Quantum 2.0: Dawn of Quantum Technology Friday, 10/7, 2:00 pm, Dreese Lab 260 (in person only) Abstract : \"While the first quantum revolution saw fundamental advances in quantum science (electrons in solids, interaction of matter with EM fields) yield breakthroughs in classical technology (transistor, laser, NMR/MRI), the second quantum revolution sees the coming of age of quantum technology, technology that obeys quantum rules. (An example is the use of quantum light to turn LIGO into a bona fide quantum sensor.) Inventing quantum technology will require mastering the transition from hero experiments in the protected environment of a discovery-based physics laboratory to practical, field-deployable quantum devices. Such advances require the full fledgling of the new field of quantum engineering, a hybrid of fundamental and applied science ripe with exciting technical and educational challenges, and a unique opportunity to explore new intellectual frontiers while building diverse quantum workforce and community of scholars. In this talk, I'll present my vision of the Quantum 2.0 landscape and of how a research university can lead in this transformational era.\" Bio : \"Olivier Pfister received the B.S. in Physics from Universit\u00e9 de Nice, France, in 1987, and the M.S. and the Ph.D. in Physics from Universit\u00e9 Paris-Nord, France, in 1989 and 1993.

He is an Ohio State/CSE Alumnus, graduated with Prof. Gagan Agrawal.\u00a0 All interested parties are invited to join his talk. Date: August 4, 2023 Where: Dreese Lab #480 When: 1:30-2:30 pm Title: Large-Scale Tile-centric Spatial Statistics Modeling and Prediction Approximations on Manycore Systems Abstract: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is widely used in Geoscience for modeling spatial and spatio-temporal data. It is a versatile technique that can be applied to various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, Gaussian mixture models, and more. In the context of Geoscience, MLE involves generating an npt X npt covariance matrix to represent the underlying geospatial random field, where n denotes the number of spatial locations, p represents the number of variables, and t indicates the number of time slots. However, when dealing with large npt values, the computational complexity of MLE increases significantly, reaching O((npt)^3), which poses practical limitations. In previous studies, researchers have explored two approaches to address the computational burden associated with MLE: leveraging high-performance computing and employing algebraic approximations. In our research, we combine parallel processing with matrix approximation techn\u00a0 iques to enhance the efficiency of MLE computations on large-scale systems. Specifically, we utilize two approximation methods: mixed precisions and tile low-rank approximations. This combination allows us to achieve higher compression rates and faster time-to-solution while maintaining the required level of accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approximation technique delivers accurate estimates for statistical parameters while significantly improving performance. We conducted experiments on multiple systems, including Riken Fugaku (a Fujitsu A64FX system), ORNL Summit (a V100 GPU system), KAUST Shaheen-II (an Intel Haswell system), HLRS HAWK (an AMD Epyc Rome system). These systems were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and showcase its performance gains.

Thu, Jan 24 2019, 7:30pm DK Panda, Professor, The Ohio State University Thursday, January 24th at 7:30pm 120 Caldwell Labs How to Design Software Libraries for Top Supercomputers in the World? Part III: Deep Learning Significant growth has been witnessed during the last decade in High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters with multi-/many-core processors, accelerators, and high-performance interconnects (such as InfiniBand, Omni-Path, iWARP, and RoCE). Many supercomputers in the world are currently being designed with commodity HPC clusters. The Network-Based Computing Laboratory ( http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu ) at OSU/CSE in actively engaged in designing software libraries (HPC, Big Data, Deep Learning, and Cloud) for such supercomputers. An overview of these activities will be covered in four presentations. These presentations will also provide an outline of the associated research, publications, designs, testing and support framework for these libraries. Opportunities for students to get involved in the R&D activities in these projects will be outlined. During the third talk of this academic year, we will focus on the High-Performance Deep Learning (HiDL) project ( http://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu ). As a part of this project, high-performance designs for common Deep Learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Caffe have been designed. We will start with an overview of interesting trends in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) design and how cutting-edge hardware architectures are playing a key role in moving the field forward. We will also present an overview of different DNN architectures and DL frameworks. Most DL frameworks started with a single-node/single-GPU design. However, approaches to parallelize the process of DNN training are also being actively explored. The DL community has moved along different distributed training designs that exploit communication runtimes like gRPC, MPI, and NCCL. In this context, we will highlight new challenges and opportunities for communication runtimes to efficiently support distributed DNN training. We also highlight some of our co-design efforts to utilize CUDA-Aware MPI for large-scale DNN training on modern GPU clusters. The talk will follow with an open Q&A session with several members of the Network-Based Computing Laboratory. The session will conclude with a tour of the Laboratory consisting of multiple high-end clusters involving thousands of cores. Bio:\u00a0DK Panda is a Professor and University Distinguished Scholar of\u00a0Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University.\u00a0 He has published over 450 papers in the area of high-end computing and networking.\u00a0 The MVAPICH2 (High Performance MPI and PGAS over InfiniBand, Omni-Path, iWARP and RoCE) libraries, designed and developed by his research group ( http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu ), are currently being used by more than 2,950 organizations worldwide (in 86 countries).

It is divided into two parts. First, I will show how collaborative interactions enable continual learning, where agentive systems improve over time through interaction. I will describe an interactive game-like environment that instantiates collaborative interactions with natural language coordination, and show how it creates a contextual bandit learning scenario for language production (i.e., generation). I will also briefly show how this formulation generalizes to language comprehension. In the second part, I will discuss language-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). Although the pairing of natural language and RL is promising for both research and application, it is a research avenue that remains challenging to pursue. I will describe a new approach for language-conditioned RL benchmarking that strikes a balance between research accessibility and retaining the complexities and nuances of natural language.

Tue, Nov 7 2023, 10:30 - 11:30am Cockins Hall 240 1958 Neil Ave Columbus , OH 43210 United States Shuyan Zhou is giving a talk on autonomous AI agents on Tuesday, Nov. 7. Talk Date: Tuesday, Nov. 7 from 10:30AM to 11:30AM Location: Cockins Hall 240 (1958 Neil Ave, Columbus) Abstract: For years, my dream has been to create autonomous AI agents capable of carrying out tedious tasks, allowing me to focus on more creative and exciting tasks. Modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have suddenly brought us much closer to achieving such AI agents. But, has my dream already come true? In 2020, I started research on AI agents, through my experience, I have recognized LLMs as a crucial yet early step in the broader landscape of AI agent research. While LLMs show promising results on well-specified tasks such as drafting and sending emails or answering everyday questions, they struggle with more complex tasks such as coordinating a meeting for multiple participants. Such tasks often span a long horizon and require a wealth of procedural knowledge and dynamic interaction with the environment. Current LLMs cannot perform such challenging tasks with consistent accuracy and even may pose safety risks due to their unpredictable behavior. In this talk, I will present three thrusts in my research toward this dream: the formalism of planning and acting, the learning of open-domain procedural knowledge, and the evaluation of AI agents. Bio: Shuyan Zhou ( https://shuyanzhou.com ) is a final-year Ph.D. student from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Graham Neubig. She studies autonomous AI agents and she aims to create AI agents that could perform tedious tasks so that everyone can focus on more creative and interesting tasks. Before joining CMU, she received her B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology.

The data holders want to train or infer with private data while exploiting accelerators, such as GPUs, that are hosted in the cloud. Cloud systems are vulnerable to attackers that compromise the privacy of data and integrity of computations. Tackling such a challenge efficiently requires exploiting hardware security capabilities to reduce the cost of theoretical privacy algorithms. This talk will describe my group\u2019s experiences in building privacy preserving machine learning systems. I will present DarKnight, a framework for large DNN training while protecting input privacy and computation integrity. DarKnight relies on cooperative execution between trusted execution environments (TEE) and accelerators, where the TEE provides privacy and integrity verification, while accelerators perform the bulk of the linear algebraic computation to optimize the performance. The second part of the talk will focus on an orthogonal approach to privacy using multi-party computing (MPC). We present detailed characterisation of MPC overheads when executing large language models in a distributed manner. We then present MPCpipe a pipelined MPC execution model that overlaps computation and communication in MPC.

In his talk, Guzdial reviews the history of \u201ccomputer science\u201d and its earlier purpose, considers the barriers to reaching universal computational literacy, then describes and demonstrates new kinds of languages, tools, and approaches for learning and teaching computing for everyone. The term \u201ccomputer science\u201d was invented as something that should be taught to everyone in order to facilitate learning other subjects and to reduce the danger of having this powerful new technology controlled by only a few. Computing education has not become the democratizing force imagined in the 1960\u2019s. Today, computer science has a narrow definition, and only a privileged few understand and create a critical part of its world. \"If we wanted to reach the original and more general goal, we would have to change how we teach computing \u2014 and maybe even change computing.\" Mark Guzdial is a Professor in Computer Science & Engineering and Director of the Program in Computing for the Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan. He studies how people come to understand computing and how to make that more effective. He was one of the founders of the International Computing Education Research conference. He was a lead on the NSF alliance \u201c Expanding Computing Education Pathways \" which helped US states improve and broaden their computing education. He invented and has written several books on the \u201cMedia Computation\u201d contextualized approach to computing education. With his wife and colleague, Barbara Ericson, he received the 2010 ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator award.\u00a0 He is an ACM Distinguished Educator and a Fellow of the ACM.

Thu, Oct 24 2024, 4 - 5pm Dreese Laboratories Room 480 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH 43210 United States Shinji Watanabe , Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, is presenting \u201cReproducing Large Speech Foundation Models,\u201d on Thursday, Oct. 24 at 4 pm in Dreese Labs room 480. Talk Title: Reproducing Large Speech Foundation Models Talk Abstract: Speech foundation models are an active research area with the potential to consolidate various speech-processing tasks within a single model. A notable trend in this domain involves scaling up data volume, model size, and the range of tasks. This scaling trajectory has brought about significant changes in our research landscape, particularly regarding resource allocation. Notably, it has led to a division of research roles, where large tech companies primarily focus on building foundational models, while smaller entities, including academic institutions and smaller companies, concentrate on refining and analyzing these models. While this division has streamlined research efforts, there is a growing concern about the potential loss of explainability in these foundational models. This is primarily due to the limited transparency in the model-building process, often dictated by company policies. To address this concern, our group has started the development of large-scale speech foundation models. Our talk introduces Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM), a series of speech foundation models developed at Carnegie Mellon University, reproducing OpenAI Whisper-style training using publicly available data and our open-source toolkit ESPnet. Crucially, our models exhibit several explainable behaviors thanks to the transparency inherent in our model-building process. In addition to showcasing the OWSM models, we discuss the related research efforts encompassing software development, data collection, cleaning, and model evaluation. Throughout this presentation, we would like to discuss how to address the research challenges posed by this shifting landscape within our speech and audio community.

Talk Title : Verifying Database Execution: Revisiting Concurrency Correctness in Modern Systems Talk Abstract : Ensuring database correctness is crucial, but verifying it remains a significant challenge. Modern transactional databases---leveraging distributed architectures, outsourced components, geo-replication, and advanced optimizations---further complicate the verification process. In this talk, we present our recent efforts to tackle this problem, resulting in several key advancements. These include the development of systems for verifying serializability and snapshot isolation of black-box databases, a simpler snapshot isolation definition, a specialized SMT solver, and a unified framework---both theoretical and implemented---for verifying concurrent systems. More broadly, databases represent just one example within a wide range of modern concurrent systems, including serverless platforms, deep learning training frameworks, and cloud infrastructure. We believe that now is the right time to revisit the classic problem of verifying concurrency correctness for this new generation of systems. Bio : Cheng Tan is an assistant professor at Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. His research interests are in computer systems, verifiable systems, and neural networks for systems. He is a recipient of the SOSP\u201917 Best Paper Award, ASPLOS'23 Distinguished Artifact Award, Janet Fabri Dissertation Prize, MSRA StarTrack Scholar, and NSF CAREER Award.

These obstacles force practitioners to often use algorithmic heuristics, in an attempt to convert data into useful information, fast. It is necessary to rethink the algorithmic design, and devise smarter and provable methods in order to flexibly balance the trade-offs between solution accuracy, efficiency, and data interpretability. In this talk, I will focus on the problem of low rank matrix inference in large-scale settings. Such problems appear in fundamental applications such as\u00a0structured inference,\u00a0recommendation systems and multi-label classification problems. I will introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the performance of\u00a0non-convex\u00a0first-order methods, often used as heuristics in practice. These methods lead to computational gains over classic convex approaches, but their analysis is unknown for most problems. This talk will provide precise theoretical guarantees, answering the long-standing question \u201cwhy such non-convex techniques behave well in practice?\u201d for a wide class of problems. Bio: Anastasios Kyrillidis received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2014. Currently, he is a Simons Fellowship PostDoc researcher at the University of Texas (Austin).

Compiled by The Princeton Review, one of America's best-known education and admission services companies, the 2014 list names 25 graduate schools in rank order (1 to 25). The Princeton Review chose the schools based on a survey it conducted in Fall 2013 of 150 programs at institutions offering video game design coursework and/or degrees in the United States, Canada, and some countries abroad. The Company's 50-question survey asked schools to report on a range of topics from academic offerings and faculty credentials to graduates\u00ed employment and professional achievements. Among criteria The Princeton Review weighed to make its selections: the school curriculum, faculty, facilities, and infrastructure, plus career services and technology. \"We are very honored to be included as one of the premier universities to perform research and graduate education in video game design. The success of our students has been noticed,\" says Dr. Roger Crawfis, Associate Professor and one of the key Faculty members involved in Game Design research in the Department Computer Science and Engineering. Said Robert Franek, Princeton Review Senior VP/Publisher, \"It has long been our mission to help students find - and get into - the schools best for them. For students aspiring to become game designers, we highly recommend The Ohio State University as one of the best institutions to study and to launch a career in this exciting field. We also salute the faculty and staff at The Ohio State University and the other schools on our 2014 lists for their exceptional academic and professional contributions to their students and to the industry of game design.\" The Princeton Review also reported a companion list of top 25 undergraduate schools to study game design for 2014. The Company's full report on this project is accessible at www.princetonreview.com/game-design . It includes profiles of the schools with application information and links to the school sites. For the second consecutive year, The Princeton Review teamed up with PC Gamer, a monthly magazine published by Future plc ( www.futureplc.com ) as its reporting partner on this project.

This award supports junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars by combining outstanding research, excellent education, and integrated education and research. Rademacher is currently focusing on the analysis and exploration of data, including classification, inference, and retrieval. Generally this involves the extraction of features that are relevant to a particular goal. In the design of algorithms for the analysis and exploration of data, feature extraction techniques act as basic building blocks or primitives that can be combined to model complex behavior using a variety of tools. Data rarely satisfies the precise assumptions of these models and feature extraction tools and, combining these tools amplifies errors. Rademacher is tackling the challenging task of designing new algorithms that are robust against noise and that can be combined as building blocks while keeping the error propagation under control.",

A \u201chackathon\u201d is an event in which computer programmers and other software developers collaborate intensively on software projects over an extended period of time. This event hosted 34 teams, totaling 103 participants, ranging from freshmen to post-graduate students, CSE-majors to non-majors. The event kicked off with talks on big data from event sponsors Hortonworks and Teradata. Following the presentations the teams had until the next afternoon, including a \u201cpower-hour\u201d at 2 a.m. due to daylight savings time, to develop a software project and present their results in a concluding 5-minute presentation. Judges scored the projects based on creativity, technical depth, challenge of doing the task in a limited time, and the projects usefulness in the real-world. Students were provided a list of \u201cbounties\u201d\u2014 suggested project ideas that solved problems at the University Library\u2014and were also encouraged, but not required, to tackle projects involving big data and mobile applications. The final projects included such broad ranging topics as a suicide prevention app to an OSU-centered facebook called OSYou. The winners were awarded Parrot AR Quadcopters, Nexus 7 Tablets, Sphero robots, Leap Motion Devices, or Arduino Kits. The prizes were provided by Google, Hortonworks, and Teradata. Since some of the teams were smaller than the number of prizes that they could have been awarded, the extra prizes will form \u201cThe Hack Library,\u201d operated by the OSU Open Source Club, that will allow students to borrow the devices to build projects. The hackathon was intended to raise awareness of the technical talent at Ohio State and operate with recent campus initiatives around student preparedness and community building. The event also gave students the opportunity to network with tech companies and receive feedback on their presentations. The hackathon was organized by CSE Assistant professor Arnab Nandi and University Libraries Associate Professor and Head of Research Services, Meris Mandernach.

Fri, Oct 11 2024, 3 - 4pm Dreese Laboratories Room 480 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH 43210 United States Jun (Jim) Xu , Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, will give a talk on database research Friday, Oct. 11 at 3 pm in Dreese Labs room 480, located at 2015 Neil Ave, Columbus. Xu\u2019s research is in the areas of networking, database, and machine learning. Seminar is organized by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and by the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering. Talk Title: From Error-Estimating Codes to Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (ANNS):\u00a0\u00a0A Networking Researcher\u2019s Unusual Journey into Database Research Talk Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (ANNS), aka similarity search, has been an important research topic for decades, with new and challenging ANNS problems continue to emerge from database and machine learning applications.\u00a0\u00a0ANNS problems, classical or new alike, have become increasingly difficult to solve due to the rapid growth of data (set) size and dimension in the past two decades.\u00a0\u00a0This talk will summarize my research in the past three years into ANNS.\u00a0\u00a0In this research, we have formulated new and exciting ANNS problems (e.g. ANNS after linear transformation, or ANNS-ALT), produced highly scalable ANNS solutions (e.g., ONe Index for All Kernels, or ONIAK), and designed fundamental algorithmic primitives that are the secret sauce that makes our ANNS solutions highly scalable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These primitives are fundamental in that they can be used to solve other (than ANNS) database and machine learning problems.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, so far they have already led to the resolution of three high-profile algorithmic research questions that have been open or \u201copenly hated\u201d for decades:\u00a0\u00a0(1) Can we compute an arbitrary multi-dimensional range sum of (ideally i.i.d.) RVs in polylog time and space?\u00a0\u00a0(2) Can we perform multi-dimensional data cube queries and updates in polylog time and space? (3) Can we compute the quadratic form x^T Gx (given x as argument) in less than O(d^2) time, where G is a d*d Gaussian random matrix (fixed after being generated)?\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly, the seed of this database research was planted a decade ago, during my pursuit of a wireless networking research problem called error-estimating codes, but embarrassingly it took me nearly a decade to connect the dots. Bio: Jun Xu has been a faculty member in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech since 2000. He has worked on the design and analysis of network algorithmics for over two decades, and co-authored the second edition of the legendary namesake textbook. He was instrumental in introducing randomization to the design of network algorithmics. His network algorithmics research jointly with his former students has garnered Best Student Paper Awards in conferences such as ACM Sigmetrics. In the past three years, he has ventured into an emerging research field called big data algorithmics that includes topics such as locality sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques for supporting similarity search in database and machine learning applications, and follows the same guiding principle of network algorithmics: combining algorithmic thinking with systems thinking. He has been an ACM Distinguished Scientist since 2010. Tag: Talk Event Highlight Fri, Oct 11 2024, 3 - 4pm Dreese Laboratories Room 480 2015 Neil Ave Columbus , OH 43210 United States",

These women were a part of the Ohio State Chapter of Association of Computing Machinery's Committee on Women in Computing (ACM-W). While at GHC, the students had the opportunity to attend keynote speaker sessions each morning, break out sessions, a career fair, and social events. These events provide the opportunity to network with current women professionals and meet students from universities across the nation, as well as pursue internship or full time opportunities and discover new domains within computing. \"I met a lot of really amazing women at the conference who are leaders at what they do. I was particularly inspired by people who time and time again were told that they shouldn't be taking on leadership positions and yet continued to do so because they believed in their own work\", said Ohio State alumna Arathi Mani, \"The theme of this year's conference was \"Think Big. Drive Forward\" and I learned that with the right attitude and support group, women can really do amazing things.\" This is the second consecutive year that Ohio State was able to send a significant number of women to the Celebration, and ACM-W hopes to continue this tradition with the 2014 Celebration in Phoenix, Arizona. Each year the conference grows in size, with last year breaking records at over 4,750 people from around the world. Find out more: Grace Hopper 2013 .

Most systems today excel in only one of these dimensions, often at the expense of the others, risking the long term economic and environmental sustainability of cloud computing. His research employs performance modelling and autonomic computing to prototype high-performance cloud systems that are sustainable and scalable. Stewart\u2019s current project addresses a common issue facing cloud systems: dirty, carbon-intensive energy is cost effective, but not environmentally sustainable. Greening as a service exposes this issue to end users, allowing them to route requests through sustainable datapaths. The challenges are to track datapaths across multiple geographically distributed datacenters, move them to clean energy (e.g., via carbon offsets), and keep response times and costs relatively low. Stewart created datagreening.com , a prototype greening service that powers email with clean energy. Through this service, he hopes to gather data on the carbon footprint of popular email providers while helping hundreds of users utilize more sustainable computing services. The research will also help system managers identify performance bugs, especially costly ones that shift energy consumption toward datacenters with high energy costs. Stewart is the editor of IEEE Sustainable Computing Register. He received his PhD from the University of Rochester in 2008 under the supervision of Kai Shen, associate professor of computer science. Before that, he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA.

(DK) Panda and his team will play a key role in a $10 million cloud computing research project announced recently by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Co-located at the University of Chicago and The University of Texas at Austin, the NSFCloud testbed called Chameleon will support the design, deployment and initial operation of a large-scale, reconfigurable experimental environment for cloud research. Partners on the Chameleon project include The Ohio State University, Northwestern University and the University of Texas at San Antonio. Cloud computing refers to the practice of using a network of remote servers to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. In recent years, cloud computing has become the dominant method of providing computing infrastructure for Internet services. Chameleon will consist of 650 cloud nodes with 5 petabytes of storage. Researchers will be able to configure slices of Chameleon as custom clouds using pre-defined or custom software to test the efficiency and usability of different cloud architectures on a range of problems, from machine learning and adaptive operating systems to climate simulations and flood prediction. Ohio State\u2019s Network-Based Computing Laboratory, led by Prof. Panda, will focus on high performance network protocols and middleware critical to cloud storage, processing and sharing. Panda\u2019s team designed and developed MVAPICH, a high-performance message passing interface (MPI) library for clusters with InfiniBand, iWARP and RoCE interconnects. The MPI software is currently being used by more than 2,200 organizations in 73 countries, empowering many TOP500 systems around the world. According to Panda, in the Chameleon project, MVAPICH as well as other big data middleware from his group will be enhanced to work in a physical server\u2014also known as bare metal\u2014cloud environment. The aim will be to deliver high-performance and scalability together with virtualization. \"Delivering bare metal performance for big compute research and big data to complement virtualization has been an open-challenge in the community for many years,\u201d he said. \"Our team will try to achieve this and provide new ways to design, deploy and use next generation cloud environments.\" For more details, read the full NSF release .

    "text_content": "Alumnus Kumar to lead new NIH Center | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Alumnus Kumar to lead new NIH Center Alumnus Kumar to lead new NIH Center Posted: October 23, 2014 Making Sense of Big Data to Improve Patient Care The health sensors of the future will run virtual circles around today\u2019s pedometers and heart-rate monitors, churning out enormous amounts of data about everything from biology to behavior that can explain a patient\u2019s health status. Those extensive details will create a need for big-data analytics to make sense of mobile and body-worn sensors\u2019 output so clinicians can use the information to treat patients. The Ohio State University is part of an 11-institution consortium funded by the\u00a0National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fulfill these combined needs by developing tools that make it easier to gather, analyze and interpret data generated by health sensors. Products from the initiative will include open-source computing systems to crunch the data and software that can deliver useful, \u201cactionable\u201d information to health care practitioners. The $10.8 million in NIH funding over four years establishes the National Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K). The University of Memphis will lead the center, which will apply new technologies to two specific health care challenges: reducing hospital readmissions among congestive heart failure patients and preventing relapse among people who have quit smoking. Santosh Kumar, a computer scientist at the University of Memphis and an Ohio State alumnus (computer science and engineering master\u2019s and Ph.D.), will direct the center. The MD2K team also includes scientists from Cornell Tech, Georgia Tech, Northwestern, Rice, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Michigan, as well as the nonprofit Open mHealth. Three Ohio State investigators will lend their expertise to this initiative:\u00a0William Abraham, director of cardiovascular medicine\u00a0at\u00a0Ohio State\u2019s Wexner Medical Center;\u00a0Emre Ertin, research professor of electrical and computer engineering; and\u00a0Clay Marsh, chief innovation officer for Wexner Medical Center and professor of internal medicine. Abraham will lead clinical studies of technologies developed for heart failure care, Ertin designs novel biosensors and specializes in signal processing required to interpret sensor data, and Marsh will direct the pursuit of health care innovations enabled by the center\u2019s initial work. \u201cThe idea here is to take everything that could possibly be known about a patient and put it into these big-data, deep-computing analytics so we can learn about those patients, and see and anticipate things that we can\u2019t otherwise see when we look at just bits and pieces of information,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cDay-to-day data from these sensors will be analyzed and interpreted in a way that deepens a clinician\u2019s understanding of a patient\u2019s status. It allows for better and more personalized decisions in regard to health care and management.\u201d Ertin will contribute on the front end; he designs biosensors in addition to his signal processing emphasis. Among his projects are sensors that detect fluid levels in the lungs, breathing patterns and cardiac motion. These sensors do not require skin contact, but instead use radiofrequency waves to make their measurements. [Emre Ertin] Emre Ertin in his lab\u201cThese sensors can easily blend into your daily life routine, and therefore have the potential to dramatically expand the scale of physiological data we can obtain in the field while minimizing the burden to participants,\u201d he said. The center\u2019s scientists predict that the data will include measures of physical, biological, behavioral, social and environmental factors that contribute to health and disease risk. \u201cThe sensors provide a large, noisy, complex data stream about the many facets of your life and health, and there is a gaping need for a computational engine that can transform sensor data into something useful for clinicians,\u201d Ertin said. Though the center will target heart failure and smoking relapse, the approach and products of MD2K will be applicable to such other complex diseases as asthma, substance abuse and obesity. This is where Marsh, executive director of the\u00a0IDEA Studio for Healthcare and Design\u00a0at Ohio State, comes in. He will lead investigations into new applications of MD2K to improve health and health care, solidifying the role of mobile-sensor big data as a key player in the delivery of personalized medicine. \u201cThis ties directly to the mission of the IDEA Studio \u2013 not just solving important problems in health care, but collaborating across multiple disciplines to produce solutions to those problems,\u201d Marsh said, noting the M2DK center is composed of computer science, engineering, statistical and biomedical researchers \u2013 \u201cthe kind of team required to take on the massive challenge of managing big data and translating this to knowledge and solutions to help people.\u201d This center is part of the NIH\u00a0Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)\u00a0initiative designed to support advances in research, policy and training needed for the effective use of big data in biomedical research.

The College of Engineering is taking a leading role, along with the College of Arts and Sciences, in directing the new degree program and delivering the core courses in computer sciences, mathematics and statistics. Majors will receive a BS in data analytics from the College of Arts and Sciences. \u201cThis collaborative and industry-responsive major in data analytics ensures that students will receive best-in-class preparation to become the next great Buckeye innovators in myriad fields,\u201d said David B. Williams, Monte Ahuja Endowed Dean\u2019s Chair and dean of the College of Engineering. The data analytics program answers a strongly-articulated industry need for graduates with both quantitative computational and modeling skills, as well as critical thinking skills. Companies are seeking employees with acumen to not only build and query large data sets, but also to understand how to ask the right questions to extract critical, useable knowledge. \u201cThis area represents something that has grown up at the interface of business, computer science and engineering, especially engineering problem solving,\u201d said David Tomasko, associate dean for undergraduate education and services. \u201cIt really is a very good example of something that requires interdisciplinary skills that come from many different points in the university.\u201d Engineering has a big role to play in data analytics\u2014both as a fundamental piece of the burgeoning new field and as a consumer of data analytics technology. \u201cThe newly created data analytics major at Ohio State will timely respond the high demand of data processing in all the application areas. A challenging and revolutionary task in the human society today is to seek new insights and new knowledge from increasingly large data sets generated from various businesses and from our daily life,\" commented CSE Chairperson and\u00a0 The foundation of this new major is computer science and statistical modeling. The CSE department has an outstanding education and research program in computer systems, data mining, databases, machine learning, and high performance computing, which will provide best support to this new major.\u201d The core curriculum for the data analytics major provides a solid foundational footing; students will learn principles of data representation and big data management, software design and programming, and statistical modeling and analysis. General education requirements will provide students with the required skills to be able abstract, analyze and present actionable insights. A foreign language requirement addresses the fact that big data is an international field. Next, students will select courses in an area of specialization that will prepare them for experiential learning opportunities through partnerships with businesses. Specializations in biomedical informatics, business analytics and computational analytics are currently available. Other options, such as visual analytics, are likely to be added soon. Like all Buckeye engineering students, data analytics majors will be required to complete a capstone or experiential component. \u201cOur industry partners kept reiterating that we need to make sure students have not just the quantitative skills, but also the soft skills to be able to present actionable insights from the data,\u201d explained Computer Science and Engineering Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy, co-director of the data analytics major. \u201cThe experiential component is central to training students to be able to do that. Every student who graduates through this program has to have at least one capstone experience, and we expect that all of them will have had co-op or internship opportunities as well.\u201d In addition to going directly to work in industry, graduates of the new degree program will also be well-prepared to pursue graduate studies. The major is aligned with Ohio State\u2019s Discovery Themes Initiative, a ten-year, multi-million dollar investment in critical research in the areas of energy and environment, food production and security, and health and wellness. A foundational tool for tackling these challenges, data analytics is a burgeoning research area within the college, with applications and connections to virtually all of its major research thrusts. \u201cFrom the design of new computer architectures and corresponding analytics algorithms, to deriving new ways to visualize massive, high-dimensional data sets and their underlying structures\u2014the college is aggressively studying key big data issues,\u201d said Associate Dean for Research Randy Moses. Dozens of related research projects are underway across all areas of the college. At the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (CEMAS), for instance, researchers are combining new approaches in electron microscopy with advances in visualizing high-dimensional data for applications such as understanding how materials crack and fail. Professor DK Panda (computer science and engineering) is deriving new computer architectures to handle massive data sets; Professor Joel Johnson (electrical and computer engineering) is conducting research on remote sensing and data processing of environmental data, which could help detect algae blooms in lakes or soil moisture levels; and Professor \u00dcmit V. \u00c7ataly\u00fcrek (electrical and computer engineering and bioinformatics) is using data analytics to developed improved methods for identifying breast cancer. Meanwhile, Professor Scott Shearer (food, agricultural and biological engineering) is working on new remote sensing capabilities to understand crop health from UAV sensor data; and Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy (computer science and engineering) is working to develop new ways to glean real-time insights from social media for disaster and large-scale emergency response. The era of big data is here to stay and the Ohio State College of Engineering remains committed to developing the understanding, tools and talent needed to tackle the big data challenge.

    "text_content": "6 Invaluable Ideas from OHI/O | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News 6 Invaluable Ideas from OHI/O 6 Invaluable Ideas from OHI/O Posted: October 13, 2014 During the weekend of October 3-5, The Ohio State University hosted its annual \"OHI/O\" Hackathon which attracted a variety of talented programmers. Over the course of the weekend, the teams brought their innovative ideas to life through numerous lines of code. The coding took place in the basement and third floor of the Science and Engineering Library, and both of these locations were filled with students mapping out their logic on whiteboards; staring diligently at their computer screens typing away; or taking an occasional nap and food break. Six of the countless creative ideas from the event are listed below along with a picture of the corresponding group. Lock screen app: For the many people that would like to protect their phones from thieves and children, the lock-screen app would be a useful tool.\u00a0The team creating the app described it as a way to disable specific apps on a phone at certain times. For example, a bank account application could be locked when someone did not need it in order to prevent accidental or unintended withdrawals. Additionally, this app would be great in keeping a younger cousin or sibling from continuously sneaking away your phone to play candy crush saga. Challenge app: As challenges have become a huge trend on social media lately, one group decided to create an app exclusively devoted to sharing and viewing challenges among friends. The app would include features allowing users to invent their own challenges for friends. Also, users would be able to upload proof when they had completed a challenge. Movie Recommendation App: This app is geared toward indecisive people who love to watch movies and also presents a quick solution to selecting a movie that a group of friends can all agree upon. Users login through Facebook, and the app will use the most popular movies among the user's friends in order to recommend a possible movie back to the user. Also, the team indicated that the app would not just use specific ratings in order to choose the movie; rather it would use actual comments and written reviews. Blocks Maximizing App: Anyone who has ever been on the blocks meal plan knows about the annoyance of constantly aiming for a multiple of $5.00 as their item total. Some students end up so fed up with this process that they just throw away the extra money on their blocks. As a solution to this problem, two students worked to develop an app that will maximize the amount of food that one could buy with a certain amount of blocks. Users could enter each food item that they wanted to buy and the app would assist in providing efficient spending suggestions to eliminate wasted money. Storage Transfer System: Building upon Dropbox for businesses, two students worked to reduce repetition in data storage. In Dropbox, users have files saved to their computer and also saved to the cloud. As this can be somewhat repetitive, the team wanted to hold the majority of the data on the cloud and users could retrieve data as they needed it. There would be placeholder folders for the specific files that could be downloaded instantly from the cloud when needed, but they wouldn't waste space when they were not in use. The idea would greatly save storage space on the user's computer. Instant Translation Slideshow: Last but not least, the instant translation slideshow would be a great tool in assisting international students to quickly translate a lecture as they listen to it. The group of four students worked to use sound recognition in order to translate spoken English phrases into live captions on a computer screen. With the large variety of English words, the group was planning to use separate dictionaries based on the class that the translating slideshow would be needed for such as a computer science dictionary of terms, a chemistry dictionary of terms, etc... Props given to all of the teams who participated in the event, and all OSU students should be on the lookout for some of these apps to hit the Android and iOS market.

This award is the most prestigious award given by The Ohio State University Graduate School and recognizes the outstanding scholarly accomplishments and potential of graduate students entering the final phase of their dissertation research or terminal degree project. The Presidential Fellowship provides financial support so that each awardee may devote one year of full-time study to the completion of his or her dissertation or degree project unimpeded by other duties. Mr. Voss is a fourth year PhD student working in the area of Machine Learning, co-advised by Mikhail Belkin and Luis Rademacher. He received B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Michigan State in 2011.\u00a0 He is a Machine learning is a subarea of artificial intelligence which uses the statistical analysis of data to make sense of the world.\u00a0 Its relevance is highlighted by the success of corporate systems such as Apple's Siri which interacts with a cell phone user using speech recognition and the advent of self driving cars which can now be legally road tested in California, Michigan, Florida, and Nevada.\u00a0 Such systems rely on machine learning techniques to find patterns within audio or video landscapes, to draw inferences, and to make decisions.\u00a0 As machine learning applications become more prevalent in every day life, it becomes increasingly important that these systems both perform well and that they do not fail in unpredictable ways in the future. James is interested in developing machine learning algorithms which are both effective in practice and have mathematical correctness guarantees.\u00a0 His research is focused in unsupervised machine learning, which is the subarea of machine learning which finds patterns in raw data and organizes the data into more meaningful or interpretable forms.\u00a0 Some broad examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering data into self-similar groups, beamforming in signal processing (for example taking multi-microphone of multiple speakers and isolating the speech signals of the individual speakers), and statistically modeling observed data. James's research is focused on algorithms for such tasks.\u00a0 More specifically, his work at Ohio State began in the area of signal separation using the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) model.\u00a0 In this model, it is assumed that one observes a multi-dimensional signal which is a linear superposition of independent, underlying (unseen) source signals.\u00a0 James works on algorithms for ICA.\u00a0 In addition, he is interested in the mathematical structures which have been observed in the relatively vast and practical ICA literature, and the potential applicability of algorithms arising in ICA to other problems. It turns out that the mathematical structure seen when using higher order statistics in ICA is also embedded in a number of other unsupervised learning problems including some clustering tasks, learning the parameters of a mixture distribution of spherical Gaussians, and certain tensor decomposition problems.\u00a0 James's current research is in the design and analysis of unifying algorithmic frameworks for these and potentially other unsupervised learning problems.

The CAREER award selection is based on an outstanding research record and plan, a strong effort of integration of education, and research within the context of the mission of each academic institution. The grant winner receives more than $400,000 for the research and education project. Twenty-nine CSE faculty members have earned CAREER Awards since the program started in 1995. The newest three CSE faculty members are working in three different but very important areas: machine learning, databases, and computer science theory. Dr. Brian Kulis is working in the area of artificial intelligence, focusing on machine learning. His CAREER project is \u201cRich and Scalable Optimization for Modern Bayesian Nonparametric Learning\u201d. His research focuses on data analysis and machine learning, and the goal is to develop new tools and algorithms for rich analysis of very large-scale data. As part of the project, he is developing algorithms for problems such as analyzing the evolution of communities in large networks, image classification, and automatic determination of topics in document collections. Kulis says of the honor, \u201cThis award will provide support for several graduate students, and will make it possible for my group to design and analyze new methods for large-scale data analysis based on Bayesian nonparametric models. I am thankful to the National Science Foundation for their ongoing support of my research.\u201d Arnab Nandi is working in the area of databases focusing on data analytics and interactive query interfaces. His CAREER project is \u201cQuerying Beyond Keyboards: Gesture-driven Querying of Databases\u201d.\u00a0 Computing devices that use non-traditional methods such as gestures to interact with data are becoming more popular. While decades of research in databases have gone into making databases more performant, the focus has typically been on large-scale pipelines, and not end users. Research in human-computer interaction and visualization has recently been investigating data management concepts for user interfaces. In order to bridge this gap, this project takes a new approach towards enabling interactive and gestural querying of data. This includes a new query model featuring the concept of a \"query intent\", and an expressive \"gestural query language,\" allowing users to use gestures as the sole mode of data interaction. The project looks into methods for \"intent interpretation,\" allowing the system to better recognize the user's query intent during the gesture and \"feedback generation,\" allowing the system to provide feedback during the gesture articulation. All components will be designed while keeping interactivity in mind, in order to maintain a low-latency loop and ensure a fluid user experience. An Ohio State College of Engineering faculty member since 2012, Nandi is also a founder of The STEAM Factory, a collaborative interdisciplinary research and public outreach initiative, and faculty director of Ohio State\u2019s OHI/O Hackathon. Anastasios (Tasos) Sidiropoulos is working in the area of theoretical computer science, focusing on computational geometry and graph theory. His CAREER project is \u201cGeometric frontiers in algorithm design\u201d. The analysis of complex data sets is a task of increasing importance for science and engineering. Even though in many applications there is an abundance of raw inputs, extracting meaningful information can often be a major computational challenge. Over the recent years, geometric methods have become an indispensable tool towards this goal. The reason behind this development is the fact that a data set endowed with pairwise similarities can be naturally interpreted as a geometric space. Such data sets include DNA sequences, statistical distributions, collections of news articles, and so on. Under this interpretation, several important data analytic questions can be understood as geometric computational problems. The main algorithmic challenges in this context occur in high-dimensional, or more generally, complex metric spaces. This project aims at resolving some of the main problems inherent in the analysis of such geometric data sets, and thus enabling improved solutions for a variety of computational tasks. \"I am very grateful for all the support I have received from my mentors, colleagues, family, and friends, as well as the department, and OSU in general,\" said Tasos.",

It culminates in an evening of a computer science known as Buck-I-Code, an outreach workshop. Saturday, February 28th marked the third iteration of this great event and despite sub-zero temperatures, receiving the attention of about 20 middle school girls. Throughout the event, they took part in lectures and workshops showcasing the opportunities and careers available with a Computer Science and Engineering degree. Participation was free and no programming experience was needed. Interestingly, many of the girls at the Buck-I-Code event said they had programmed before with MIT's SCRATCH, Java, and/or C. Talk about being ahead of the game! Dr. Paul Sivilotti kicked-off the activities presenting the increasing need for computer science and the endless possibilities of Computer Science applications. Comparing programs to recipes and each instruction to a step, he vividly illustrated the components and structure of programs. After that, the young women began using SCRATCH by MIT to complete a series of objectives including saving a turtle on the beach and pinning fire breathing dragons against fluttering butterflies. They excitedly began typing away, eager to program solutions for each objective. Other highlights included a Jeopardy! match against Dr. Christopher Stewart's Open Ephyra system (resembling IBM's Watson) and a message from Dr. Roger Crawfis about his game development research which assists stroke patients. Additionally, the girls were introduced to HTML and were given the opportunity to create their own web pages. This event gave the organizers information as well. Jon Ruben, a graduating senior and creator of the event, compiled survey results from all three Buck-I-Code workshops which totaled to 77 girls. He found that 97% of the girls said that they would recommend or consider recommending Buck-I-Code to a friend, and 57% said that they were more likely to pursue a career in technology or Computer Science. The surveys also included some comments from the girls such as \"It was great!\" and \"leaving\" was the worst part. With such an early exposure to programming, there is no limit on what these girls can achieve in the near future.",

Sadayappan has become an IEEE Fellow in the 2015 class. The citation of this honor is \u201cfor Contributions to Parallel Programming Tools for High Performance Computing\u201d. The IEEE Grade of Fellow is conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors upon Professor Sadayappan with his outstanding record of accomplishments in the IEEE Computer Society. IEEE Fellow is the highest grade of membership and is recognized by the technical community as a prestigious honor and an important career achievement. Professor Sadayappan's primary research interests center around performance optimization and compiler/runtime systems for high-performance computing, with special emphasis on high-performance frameworks that enable high productivity for application developers.\u00a0 One recent research direction with polyhedral compiler optimization has enabled advances in the state-of-the-art for automatic parallelization and data locality optimization. Another research focus has been on domain-specific compiler optimization. For example, the Tensor Contraction Engine project led by him in collaboration with computational chemists developed a domain-specific compiler that has resulted in savings of decades of person-hours of programming effort, through automatic transformation of high-level specifications into over a million lines of synthesized code for high-performance parallel implementations of dozens of models within the NWChem quantum chemistry suite. Very recent research has also resulted in advances in models, tools, and techniques for characterizing lower bounds on the data movement complexity of computations, which increasingly dominates computational complexity as the primary constraint with respect to both performance and energy efficiency. There are a total of 8 IEEE Fellows in the CSE department.",

Arora's sensor array is now being used in India's Panna National Park to discriminate tigers from humans and wildlife. Panna is well known to the environmental protection community as the tiger disappeared from the park during the last decade, but then the park became the first ever site to which the tiger was successfully transplanted and a sustainable tiger population gradually resulted.\u00a0 The sensor network helps keep tigers away from farms and villages. It also empowers the rangers watching for poachers in the reserve. \"It is as simple as that. The alarm goes off and poachers get caught,\" says Arora. When the system is fully up and running, according to Dr. Arora, it will cover all the most tiger-trafficked parts of the forest. For more details see the article here.

IEEE Visualization is a premier visualization conference and is considered as the top publication venue for visualization and computer graphics researchers. The paper \"In Situ Distribution Guided Analysis and Visualization of Transonic Jet Engine Simulations\" demonstrates an in situ distribution guided data summarization and visual analytics approach to help understand the rotating stall phenomenon in transonic jet engine compressors. The CFD simulation code TURBO, used in this work, is a state-of-the-art Navier-Stokes based, time-accurate computational fluid dynamics simulator. Despite the proven high modeling accuracy of TURBO, the excessive simulation data prohibits traditional post-processing based analysis in both storage and I/O time. This work addresses these big data issues and proposes an alternative in situ analysis pathway for the study of rotating stall. The proposed technique summarizes statistics of important properties of the simulation data directly while the simulation is running using a probabilistic data modeling scheme. This in situ data summarization enables flexible and scalable anomaly detection for flow instability in post analysis, which reveals the spatiotemporal trends of rotating stall. Furthermore, the verification of the hypotheses and exploratory visualization using the summarized data are realized using probabilistic visualization techniques such as uncertain isocontouring.

This process has become increasingly massive in the big data era from various applications, such as graphical information systems, electronic design automation, computer vision, image processing, and motion planning solutions for robotics.\u00a0 The industry demands fast and efficient solutions for daily production tasks of spatial data analytics in many areas. A research innovation led by a group of Computer Science and Engineering researchers at Ohio State has timely responded to this need. Dr. Akihiro Asahara, the CEO of Fixstars Solutions Inc . recently sent Dr. Kaibo Wang (CSE Ph.D\u201915) an acknowledgement letter to inform him that Fixstars has effectively developed the Geometric Performance Primitives (GPP) Library, an industry-leading and high speed computational geometry engine, based on Wang\u2019s work published in VLDB 2012. Dr. Asahara states, \u201cSpecifically, the PixelBox algorithm of yours lays a scientific foundation for massive polygon overlay operations, which enables us to achieve a huge performance advantage (up to 25 times faster) over other similar industry products.\u201d GPP has also been included in the GPU-Accelerated libraries of the NVDIA Company. PixelBox is a fast parallel algorithm for massive polygon overlay operations, which is implemented in a hybrid systems of both GPUs and multicore processors, and tested by pathology image analysis workloads from hospitals. This work entitled \u201c Accelerating Pathology Image Data Cross-Comparison on CPU-GPU hybrid Systems \u201d was presented in the 38th International Conference on Very Large Databases in August 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey, and was published in the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, No. 5, No. 11 in 2012. The authors of the paper are Kaibo Wang, Yin Huai, Rubao Lee, Fusheng Wang, Xiaodong Zhang, and Joel H. Saltz. Both Kaibo Wang and Yin Huai received their Ph.Ds. in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University in 2015 under the supervision of Professor Xiaodong Zhang . They now work at Google and Databricks, respectively. As students, each received the Department of Computer Science and Engineering Graduate Research Awards. The other authors are homed elsewhere. Rubao Lee is a Research Scientist in OSU-CSE. When the paper was published, Drs. Fusheng Wang and Joel Saltz were on Faculty in the Bioinformatics Department at Emory University, but are now faculty members at SUNY Stoney Brook. \u201cI am very pleased to see another basic research work of ours directly impacts on production systems, which is a high recognition to the value of our research efforts\u201d, says Xiaodong Zhang, the Robert M.

With more than 420,000 members, IEEE is the largest technical professional organization in the world. The cocktail party problem, or the problem of separating target speech from background interference, is the greatest challenge facing hearing aid wearers. Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronical conditions affecting 37.5 million Americans, and more than 10% of the world\u2019s population. Although the cocktail party problem has been tackled for decades in signal processing and related fields, no system or algorithm managed to help hearing-impaired listeners better understand speech in noisy environments. Wang\u2019s breakthrough was based on a completely new formulation of the speech separation problem. Through his unique insights into perceptual mechanisms underlying human analysis of the acoustic scene, Wang and his students formulated speech separation as a classification problem. This reformulation has a profound consequence: the cocktail party problem could be treated as a form of supervised learning. Furthermore, Wang\u2019s group was the first to introduce deep learning to the field of speech separation or enhancement. With the powerful capacity of deep neural networks to model large training data, his team finally succeeded in substantially elevating speech recognition performance of listeners with hearing loss (as well as listeners with normal hearing) in noisy backgrounds. Prof. Wang is a University Distinguished Scholar, and Co-Editor-in-Chief of Neural Networks. He is also an IEEE Fellow.",

Assistant professor Wei Xu in Computer Science and Engineering is named one of the two winners. Her winning project, LanguageNet, will create multilingual data and enable deep learning techniques for cutting-edge natural language processing research. The other winning project is on studying hate speech by a team of researchers from multiple institutions, including Stanford and Cornell University. Wei Xu\u2019s research group will leverage crowdsourcing and deep learning techniques to build a database of synonymous expressions. As long, complex ideas can be stated in a variety of ways, current natural language processing algorithms have a tough time understanding them. But building a corpus of synonymous phrases and meaning representations will be a big step forward for understanding the ever evolving human language. Wei and her team have made some great progress on their algorithms and methodology already. The problem? --- Deep learning algorithms are data hungry. The LanguageNet project will crowdsource human annotations for different languages at a large scale, through the help of CrowdFlower, and then train deep learning models to identify semantic relations.

MobiCom is a flagship conference in the area of mobile computing and wireless networking. The conference accepted only 32 papers out of 226 submissions (14.2%). From those, two were recognized for their excellence: one paper for the Best Community Paper Award, and another one for the Best Paper Award. Led and supervised by CSE Assistant Professor Chunyi Peng , the research work was conducted by CSE Ph.D. student Haotian Deng collaborating with Ph.D. candidates Yuanjie Li and Zengwen Yuan of UCLA. The paper, titled \"MobileInsight: Extracting and Analyzing Cellular Network Information on Smartphones,\" details their creation of the first in-device software tool, MobileInsight , which monitors and analyzes cellular network protocol behaviors and states using commercial off-the-shelf phones. Since it offers open-access to fine-grained runtime network operations without any extra hardware or additional data from carrier networks, it bridges the gap between the research community and industry making it possible and easy for researchers and developers to accurately understand and refine how cellular protocols operate at the device and inside the network. Since its release in June 2016, more than 40 groups across the world including the USA, UK, Germany, France, Korea, and China have downloaded and used this tool. For Haotian Deng this has been as a successful year. He has also co-authored two other conference accepted papers, one in NSDI'16 and one in SIGMETRICS'16.

Businesses also increasingly rely on the cloud\u2014global spending on cloud services is projected to surpass $305 billion in 2018, according to Garner. With its massive pooling of computing resources, cloud computing can offer organizations of all sizes the prospect of lower IT costs, fewer administrative headaches and rapid scalability. But sharing physical machines and critical computing resources\u2014like processor, memory and storage\u2014among multiple users means performance can be negatively impacted by neighboring activities. Currently, cloud users have no way to monitor hardware resource usage to see if their applications and computations might be affected by other activities. Prof. Yinqian Zhang and his team are developing monitoring tools to enable cloud computing customers to efficiently allocate computing resources.Funded by a three-year $500,000 National Science Foundation grant, Assistant Professor Yinqian Zhang is working to develop novel techniques that will enable cloud users to monitor resource usage of physical cloud servers without assistance from cloud providers. He holds a joint appointment at The Ohio State University in both computer science and engineering as well as electrical and computer engineering. The current lack of monitoring ability and performance guarantees can mean delays and slow loading times for users of customer-facing services. That affects cloud users\u2019 willingness to fully embrace the economic benefit of cloud computing, Zhang explained, especially by researchers and others whose applications require stable and predictable runtime environments. \u201cThis is part of the reason why people don\u2019t run time-sensitive scientific computations in the public cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cThe environment is not controlled and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on.\u201d Building on his expertise in cloud security research, Zhang plans to transform techniques traditionally used for malicious purposes into tools that will help cloud users gain insight into critical resource usage. Specifically, researchers plan to use self-monitoring virtual machines, which leverage nested virtualization technology and side-channel analysis techniques, to give users a tool that will enable them to see how resources are being utilized so they can allocate them more efficiently. \u201cThe idea here is rather than using this technique to attack others, we want to use it to do something good\u2014gain visibility into the hardware layer and periodically sample what is really going on in the server. Are there other virtual machines? Do they consume a lot of memory? Do they consume a lot of cache or narrow bandwidth?\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIf we observe something like that, that means the performance of my computation will degrade.\u201d New educational tools will also be developed, including Amazon machine images which enable a derivative cloud to be created on top of public clouds. Using this derivative cloud, students can easily obtain hands-on experience with cloud computing. \u201cIf I\u2019m teaching a course and want students to use a cloud service now, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBut if I can run a derivative cloud on top of the public cloud, that means I can operate a small-scale cloud environment to allow students to explore cloud computing and manage their own account.\u201d The researchers will also create open-source tools that enable self-monitoring virtual machines in public clouds and will freely share the source code and Amazon machine images to encourage adaptation and adoption of their techniques.

This annual award is given to a small number of top professors for their exceptional scholarly accomplishments. CSE faculty members were surprisingly pleased in this ceremony because they consider Saday truly deserves this award. Saday\u2019s wife and daughter came to join the celebration. Two major products determine the distinguished level of a university: the impact of faculty scholarships and the excellence of the graduated students. Saday has made great contributions for these two products at The Ohio State University. Saday joined the CSE department in 1983 (35 years ago) as an assistant professor. He has graduated more than 40 Ph.D. students. Many of them are academic and industrial leaders including an Intel Fellow, an IBM Fellow, and a Distinguished University Professor. Saday is also an outstanding teacher, and has received several teaching awards. Saday is internationally renowned for his research on compilers for high-performance and parallel computing. His nomination was supported by a group of distinguished experts in his field. One expert says, \u201cSaday has established a well-deserved reputation among his national and international peers as a stellar researcher in high-performance computing who pursues innovative approaches to persisting problems of productivity and programmability in the field.\u201d Another one states, \u201cSaday has been one of the most highly influential, innovative and productive researchers in enhancing productivity while enabling a high level of performance in high-performance computing for over 30 years, in addition to outstanding teaching, mentoring and service to the profession and community.\u201d Saday is the third Distinguished Scholar since 2014 within the CSE department after Leon Wang and DK Panda. In the ceremony, Department Chair Xiaodong Zhang commented on the three distinguished colleagues by three common traits: \u201cFirst, all of them grew from the grass roots as assistant professors in this department.

Questions like: If a self-driving car crashes, causing someone to be hurt or even killed, could software engineers or manufacturers be held liable? Should your personal data from a medical device be used to help other patients? And as smart devices become more common in homes and record more data about us, who should be able to access that data? Professor Bryan Choi listens to student discussion during his intellectual property and ownership course.Assistant Professor Bryan Choi aims to bring both the engineering and law communities together to discuss these issues and help make well-informed policy. His joint appointment in Ohio State's Moritz College of Law and Department of Computer Science and Engineering is the first of its kind at the university, and one of few such appointments nationwide. With degrees in both computer science and law, Choi is well-suited to bridge the two fields. Before joining Ohio State he was a Faculty Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School\u2019s Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition, and a Fellow at the Yale Information Society Project. He has also practiced law and worked as a software developer. One of the goals of Choi\u2019s unique role is to foster more understanding of how the fields of law and engineering can each add real value to the other. He also hopes to inspire more engineers to pursue a career in law. \u201cThe legal field needs more engineers. It\u2019s not just patent attorneys\u2014policymakers, judges and lawyers all need to understand how these technologies work in order to make better law,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we risk letting others make these decisions for us without a complete understanding of the facts or the science.\u201d For Buckeye engineers who aren't interested in pursuing a law career, Choi hopes his courses will help them understand how knowledge of legal methods and frameworks can make them better engineers. At Ohio State, Choi launched the first law class geared toward engineers and the computer science community last spring. It focused on tort law\u2014civil remedies for accidents and other personal injuries\u2014as applied to driverless cars and other cyber-physical systems. \u201cNormally when we talk about software we aren\u2019t used to worrying about tort law. But when you get to self-driving cars, which start to resemble more traditional torts such as physical loss of life or limb, then these questions become much more important,\u201d Choi explained. \u201cThe programmer\u2019s decisions will be closely scrutinized.\u201d Computer science and engineering master\u2019s student Navnith Ramkrishnan hopes to start his own software development firm one day and enrolled in the course to better understand how to protect himself as a developer. \u201cWhat I took from this is understanding the impact products can have on people and how to design products that also do a really good job when they fail,\u201d he said. \u201cThinking about it that way changed how I design products.\u201d Ramkrishnan found the course and Choi\u2019s case-based learning approach so valuable that he enrolled in Choi\u2019s current course on intellectual property and ownership. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful for engineers in general, because apart from the engineering skills you build it gives you a broader perspective \u2026 and provides insight that will help you in your career.\u201d On the research side, Choi wants to provide better legal guidance to software engineers who design cyber-physical systems. Especially when things go wrong, he said, it\u2019s important that engineers understand when the law is going to say that a programmer or manufacturer made the wrong decision and must pay, and when the law will say the risk was acceptable. His current work focuses on making code safer and more reliable. The key to accomplishing that, Choi explained, is to ensure that systems are \"crashworthy\" in a way that prevents undue harm when the code fails, the same way we expect seatbelts and airbags to protect us when a car crashes. \"We shouldn\u2019t be trying to build perfect systems,\" he explained. \"We should instead anticipate that that code will either fail or be compromised, and then ask what\u2019s the best response in that situation?\" As a member of Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDA), Choi is also part of a team examining big data questions at the intersection of computer science and law.\u00a0The institute helped create the opportunity for Choi's joint appointment through their focus on recruiting multidisciplinary scholars. \"Self-driving cars, for instance, are going to collect a ton of data.\u00a0How much data should we keep? How should you keep that data? Should it be tamper evident? How much of that should\u00a0be built into the systems before deploying them to the public?\" Choi said, sharing a few examples of the issues being studied. TDA\u2019s goal isn\u2019t just to analyze data, but to translate it for the real-world, something that appeals to Choi as both an engineer and a lawyer. \u201cLaw is very much rooted in the practicalities of the real world, as is engineering. Actively engaging with both is necessary at the onset, rather than later when it becomes costly to make meaningful changes,\u201d he explained. by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu",

    "text_content": "Making it Happen | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Making it Happen Making it Happen Posted: March 12, 2018 A year ago, Anjali Kapoor (pictured above) was a first-year student searching for a comfort zone in the male-dominated field of computer science when she showed up alone at MakeOH/O, a hardware-oriented hackathon at Ohio State. \u201cI came in pretty nervous,\u201d Kapoor said. There were about 150 students at MakeOHI/O, an intimidating beehive of wire strippers, soldering irons and an assorted equipment such as oscilloscopes. Undeterred, Kapoor signed up and joined a team with three males. To her surprise, they encouraged her to be the main coder on their project, an automated greenhouse. \u201cI was having my ideas and my voice heard,\u201d Kapoor said. Kapoor\u2019s eyes were opened, too. The Mason, Ohio, native noticed other women at the event, some participating as groups of four. \u201cIt was something that was exciting,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cI saw that my friends \u2013 women in computer science \u2013 can form teams and build products together. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces for women to work together.\u201d Kapoor\u2019s experience was so enjoyable she\u2019s now sponsorship co-leader for\u00a0MakeOHI/O, being held March 3-4 for\u00a0the third consecutive year in Knowlton Hall. Between 150 and 200 students are expected to build projects as teams of two to four in a 24-hour period at MakeOHI/O. Food will be free, and judges will award more than $1,000 in prizes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonding experience,\u201d said Bettina Bair, an Ohio State senior lecturer in computer science and engineering. \u201cThey work all night, approach obstacles and challenges together, and solve them together. It\u2019s like a camping trip, but it\u2019s all indoors and you don\u2019t have to deal with bugs and leaky tents.\u201d Tech culture jumps forward Like HackOHI/O, a larger software-oriented hackathon held on campus each fall, this year\u2019s third MakeOHI/O is a spin-off from OHI/O, a student-led program founded in 2013 to foster the university\u2019s tech culture. \u201cFor me, OHI/O was an important reason why I stayed in my major and why I stayed in tech,\u201d said Winnie Li, a Microsoft product manager and 2017 Ohio State graduate in CSE. Keeping female students in STEM through events such as MakeOHI/O is one of several ways Ohio State is trying to diversify the field of electrical and computer engineering. It\u2019s a challenge faced by universities and the work force throughout the nation. The National Science Foundation found that in 1985, more than 35 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. were women. That number is now 17.9 percent. Bair said recruitment and retention of women are the main challenges to stemming the drop-off, and both are tied to culture, an issue without one solution. Discovering solutions Ohio State is attacking the problem in numerous ways. Betty Lise Anderson, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, leads an\u00a0outreach program\u00a0to help K-12 students explore engineering.\u00a0For current students, the university has a\u00a0Women in Engineering (WiE) program\u00a0and a chapter of the\u00a0Association for Computing Machinery Committee on Women (ACM-W). \u201cThe clubs are definitely making a difference,\u201d said third-year student Courtney Campbell, co-president of the local ACM-W chapter. \u201cOhio State and ACM-W have worked really hard to make sure all women know they\u2019re supported here. You know there are people behind you, and different events like HackOHI/O and MakeOHI/O help support you.\u201d Julia Armstrong, CSE director of the OHI/O Informal Learning Program, said 20 percent of the 667 students at the 2017 HackOHI/O were women, a 4 percent improvement from the previous year. Dana Vantrease, a 2002 Ohio State graduate in CSE, was happily surprised to see so many women when she walked into the Ohio Union\u2019s main ballroom last October to serve as a mentor at HackOHI/O. \u201cAlmost every single table I looked at had at least one woman. Things have changed a lot. I still feel like we have a long way to go, but building casual interactions in hackathons builds community.\u201d ~Dana Vantrease '02 Hardware Development Engineer, Amazon Web Services The communal feel of HackOHI/O made a strong impression on Emma Wenckowski, who teamed with three other women at last year\u2019s event. \u201cWhat has helped me is walking into a room and seeing other women,\u201d said Wenckowski, a freshman from Chicago. \u201cWhat\u2019s really helping women is other women creating a space where you can find a community instead of having to fit into the boys\u2019 club. It\u2019s about finding a way to make computer science your realm and being OK that we don\u2019t all think the same way.\u201d Retaining the talent Besides a cultural shift, Ohio State events such as the upcoming MakeOHI/O offer a unique chance to learn outside a classroom. \u201cResearch has shown women benefit from making the connection between application of technology to the theory behind the technology,\u201d Bair said. \u201cIf MakeOHI/O shows there is application for hardware skills, then that is going to help retain them.\u201d Activities like MakeOHI/O that help retention are one thread in a tapestry of ways Ohio State is trying to close technology\u2019s gender gap. \u201cMakeOHI/O won\u2019t fix it,\u201d Kapoor said, \u201cbut it gives women an opportunity to say, \u2018I\u2019m in this field, I belong here, and I can do this.\u2019 That\u2019s definitely a powerful thing.\u201d Click here for more information.",

Ms. Elizabeth O\u2019Neill (Petry), Graduate Admissions Coordinator and department Mother Hen\u0099\u0099, passed away on Thursday, March 19th, 2015. Survived by children, Temsen (Kathy), Larkin (Thuylynn), Newton and Allanda; grandchildren, Nathan (Shelly), Amanda, Rachel, Thomas, and Ellen; step great-grandchildren, Haley, Dillan, and Randy; brother, Jim (Judy) Petry; sister-in-law, Nancy Petry; aunt and uncle, Jewel and Frank Vanderpool; many nieces, nephews and cousins. Elizabeth retired in 2007 after 32 years of service to the Ohio State University. She began her career in the Department of Chemistry. In 1980, Dr. David Hsiao, a faculty member and Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems, wooed her to join the young, then named, Computer and Information Science Department. Her secretarial skills were quickly noticed and she also began working for Dr. Tse Feng, a faculty member and Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Computers. Word of her work ethic, talents, and pleasant personality obviously spread because in 1986 Elizabeth took a position as the Department of English chairperson\u2019s secretary. She was not allowed to remain there long. Dr. Mike Liu requested that she return to Computer Science as his secretary because he\u2019d become the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Computers. At this point, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) became aware of her talents and recognized her efforts awarding her the IEEE Appreciation Award for Outstanding Service (1988). During the early \u201890s Elizabeth took over the Graduate Secretary position in the Computer Science Department. In this position, Elizabeth was responsible for assisting graduate students with the various rules, regulations, and paperwork necessary for them to achieve their goal of graduating. In addition, she opened, sorted, and logged in literally thousands of graduate student applications to the department over the years; including the peak year of 2001 when 1,500 came in. Her diligence in this position earned her a CSE Award for her contributions to academia. But Elizabeth was much more than \u201cjust a staff member\u201d of CSE. She was a loyal and devoted friend to anyone who showed her the same. She was the unofficial mother hen to more than one of her grad students. With the nickname, \u201cGrandma\u201d she was a stand-in grandparent for more than a few of the babies and toddlers of faculty members and students alike. Family will receive friends Friday 6-8pm at the MAEDER-QUINT-TIBERI Funeral Home, 1068 S. High St. Friends and family will meet for funeral services 10am Saturday at Good Shepherd Community Church, 210 Obetz Rd., where procession will form. Pastor Gary Kirk officiating. Burial Fernwood Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Good Shepherd Community Church or Inner City Ministries, PO Box 23087, Columbus, OH 43223.",

In conjunction with the award, Yinqian will receive $500,000 to support his research --- an investment that according to the NSF will help young scholars build a foundation for \"a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.\" Yinqian\u2019s five-year project will explore novel ways to address side-channel threats in the emerging shielded execution paradigm, such as Intel\u2019s Software Guard Extension (SGX). SGX is a hardware extension that provides software applications against compromised operating systems. However, recent studies have shown that SGX is vulnerable to side-channel threats, in which the system software measures the programs\u2019 use of system resources or micro-architectural resources to infer their secrets. Yinqian\u2019s research will develop novel principles and techniques to detect side-channel vulnerabilities in SGX software and thwart side-channel attacks at runtime. This research project will accelerate the broader acceptance of the shielded execution paradigm and the SGX technology. The research will also promote awareness of side-channel hazards to students, researchers, industry partners, and the general public, and hence motivate the adoption of the side-channel defense techniques in real-world applications. Before joining the department in 2015, Yinqian received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His research focuses on system security, cloud security, and side-channel security. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program offers the\u00a0National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations. Such activities aim to build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.",

The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced that it has awarded $60 million to the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) for the acquisition and deployment of a new supercomputer that will be the largest at any U.S. university and among the most powerful in the world. Ohio State University Computer Science and Engineering Professor DK Panda is a co-principal investigator on the award. He will lead a team of doctoral students, postdocs and research scientists in optimizing the supercomputer\u2019s software and networking. Ohio State will receive $2.5 million in funding over five years. The new system, to be known as Frontera , will begin operations in 2019. It will allow the nation\u2019s academic researchers to advance work in all fields of study, from astrophysics to zoology, enabling simulation and modeling, artificial intelligence, and data analytics at the largest scales. \u201cSupercomputers\u2014like telescopes for astronomy or particle accelerators for physics\u2014are essential research instruments that are needed to answer questions that can't be explored in the lab or in the field,\u201d said Dan Stanzione, TACC executive director. \u201cOur previous systems have enabled major discoveries, from the confirmation of gravitational wave detections by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory to the development of artificial intelligence-enabled tumor detection systems. Frontera will help science and engineering advance even further.\u201d MVAPICH software, created by Panda, will help power Frontera. MVAPICH (Message Passing Interface for InfiniBand) improves processing by connecting traditional supercomputing software with innovative networking technologies and protocols, thus increasing the data flow speed in a significant manner. It delivers the best performance, scalability and fault tolerance for high-end computing systems and servers using InfiniBand, Omni-Path, Ethernet/iWARP, and RoCE networking technologies. Panda and his team will enhance and optimize the MVAPICH library for the new supercomputer. \u201cOur software is being used by more than 2,925 organizations in 86 countries worldwide to extract the potential of these emerging networking technologies for modern systems,\u201d said Panda. MVAPICH software powers the world\u2019s second fastest supercomputer, Sunway TaihuLight at China's National Supercomputing Center. If completed today, Frontera would be the fifth most powerful system in the world, the third fastest in the U.S. and the largest at any university. For comparison, Frontera will be roughly twice as large as Stampede2 (currently the fastest university supercomputer), and 70 times larger than Ranger, both also built and operated by TACC. To match what Frontera will compute in just one second, one would have to perform one calculation every second for roughly one billion years. Anticipated early projects on Frontera include analyses of particle collisions from the Large Hadron Collider, global climate modeling, improve hurricane forecasting and multi-messenger astronomy. In addition to Ohio State, other partners include Caltech, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Princeton, Stanford, Texas A&M, the University of Chicago, the University of Utah, and the University of California, Davis. Frontera will enter production in the summer of 2019 and will operate for five years. In addition to serving as a resource for the nation\u2019s scientists and engineers, the award will support efforts to test and demonstrate the feasibility of an even larger future leadership-class system, ten times faster than Frontera, to potentially be deployed as Phase 2 of the project.",

Give me the scoop. Spill the beans. The human language allows for an infinite number of ways to describe the same idea or phrase, but these variations can be difficult for a computer to understand. An engineering researcher at The Ohio State University is earning national recognition for her work to solve this linguistic dilemma through natural language processing. [Wei Xu] Wei Xu\u201cNatural language processing is a big branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It\u2019s primarily applied in machine learning algorithms to help computers either understand human language or help generate it,\u201d explained Wei Xu, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Her project\u2014called LanguageNet\u2014aims to tackle the understanding component by building a database of expressions or paraphrases. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing not only on words and their synonyms, like CEO versus chief executive officer, but also code phrases and more complicated sentences,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially talking on social media, where language has become super creative. It\u2019s very hard to allocate every single twist\u2014there are so many variations.\u201d There has been steady progress toward large paraphrase resources, Xu said, and a significant increase in its applications, from information retrieval and extraction, and natural language generation, to IBM's Watson and Google's Knowledge Graph. Xu\u2019s research aims to create better paraphrase acquisition techniques and larger scale semantic resources, which could be of great use in various natural language processing tasks and social media data analytics in fields such as social sciences or national security. One potential application is text simplification, which automatically rephrases complex texts into simpler language for children or people with reading disabilities. Earlier this year Xu\u2019s LanguageNet team won the Q4 AI for Everyone Challenge from Figure Eight (formerly CrowdFlower), which aims to give machine learning experts the tools and resources to create AI projects that contribute to the greater good. Since deep learning algorithms are data hungry, Xu\u2019s team will use the company\u2019s resources to annotate more sentence and phrase data in 10 different languages to power their AI project. \u201cFigure Eight will be doing crowdsourcing and asking internet users to do annotation tasks,\u201d said Xu. \u201cThat human knowledge data is what\u2019s important for training automation learning algorithms. It\u2019s necessary for capturing hundreds of thousands of phrases.\u201d Xu\u2019s innovative research continues to earn recognition. She recently received a $175K CRII award from the National Science Foundation (NSF), which will support building the machine learning algorithms to make use of the human knowledge data she acquires. Additionally, Xu has earned a 2018 Best Paper Award from COLING, one of the top conferences in the field. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu",

The university-wide innovator awards recognize research creativity and entrepreneurship among Ohio State researchers by honoring the university\u2019s most successful faculty, staff and student entrepreneurs. Mr. Maung is an advisee of Dr. Roger Crawfis working in the Graphics area. He was the chief architect and software developer for an at-home gaming program for stroke patients who experience motor weakness from hemiparesis \u2013 an inability to move one side of the body. Hemiparesis, which can be debilitating, affects 325,000 individuals each year. Yet, less than one percent of those affected receive constraint-induced movement therapy (CI therapy), the most common form of therapy to improve motor function. Recognizing the need for a low-cost, accessible therapy to improve arm function, David led the software development for \u201cRecovery Rapids,\u201d an innovative 3D computer-gaming version of CI that provides in home, high repetition motor exercise that targets the affected hand, arm and shoulder and encourages use of the weaker arm to perform routine daily activities. \u201cReceiving the University award is terrific,\u201d said Maung. \u201cI believe all of us on the team were excited about the positive results we received during the PCORI trial and want to see this project disseminated. I'm glad to help make that happen.\u201d The software was developed in collaboration with a team of clinicians, computer scientists, an electrical engineer and a biochemist from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Wexner Medical Center and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital. Next steps will be the formation of a corporation called \u201cGames That Move You\u201d to disseminate this therapy. The Student Innovator of the Year award recognizes innovation and entrepreneurship among our students that has contributed to the development or commercialization of a new technology. This year\u2019s Student Innovator of the Year award is sponsored by Sigma Xi, the scientific research society honoring excellence in scientific investigation.

The paper describes key developments in the doctoral work of Uday Bondhugula, who was supervised by Professor Sadayappan, CSE. The other authors of the paper, Albert Hartono and J. Ramanujan, are also OSU/CSE Ph.D. alumni advised by Dr. Sadayappan. Details of the award citation may be found below. The PLDI 2008 paper \u201cA Practical Automatic Polyhedral Parallelizer and Locality Optimizer\u201d significantly advanced the power and practical automatic application of polyhedral analysis to automatically determine parallelism and locality improving affine transforms of regular programs expressed as sequences of possibly imperfect loops. The work presented in this paper produced practical implementations that could automatically generate OpenMP parallel programs from sequential nested loops written in C. This inspired a large number of other researchers to further develop polyhedral optimizations based on this approach, like automatic code generation for GPUs and FPGA circuits by high level synthesis from nested sequential loops. The ideas in this paper have proved to be enduring and widely applicable and even to this day keep finding new applications, e.g., for mapping machine learning algorithms to specialized accelerators.

Led by Computer Science and Engineering Professor Eric Fosler-Lussier, the project is just one of six selected to receive a Battelle Engineering, Technology and Human Affairs (BETHA) Endowment. A record number of 37 proposals were submitted in 2018 for the annual grant competition, which supports projects that examine the complex relationship between science and technology on society and cultural issues. According to Fosler-Lussier\u2019s proposal, repeated reading is an effective tool for improving fluency among young children and computer-aided technology has been helpful in providing students with additional guided practice. However, previous efforts required relatively powerful, expensive computers for speech recognition. The $55,682 in BETHA funding will enable the research team to create a web browser to make reading verification more accessible, accurate and personalized to the learner. \u201cOur previous research focused on developing computer-aided strategies for improving reading fluency for at-risk first and second graders,\u201d explained Fosler-Lussier. \u201cThat project used off-the-shelf components that required a specific operating system, and did not allow us to identify reading errors well. The BETHA grant allows us to focus on developing technology that will broaden our ability to deliver reading services in a platform-independent fashion.\u201d Fosler-Lussier said a key component of this strategy is to keep the processing of children\u2019s reading on the local device, which is important when there is little or no internet connectivity\u2014a common occurrence in many schools and homes. Local processing also helps with maintaining Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) standards, as the child\u2019s voice does not leave the device. \u201cWe will also be developing a new pronunciation \u2018fingerprinting\u2019 technique that can help the computer better detect reading errors,\u201d he added.

Over 125 students and over 25 entries competed for a grand prize of $1000. The CSE Department was represented by a team of 3 undergraduate students, Karthik Pillalamarri, Jude Rajasekera and Pulkit Ayra. Here is their experience: Our team of three went into Hakron with the goal of creating a product that could have a positive impact in the real world. When team member Pulkit got soap in his eyes while showering, he realized how difficult it is to blindly navigate a world built for those with functioning vision, and so the idea for Super Sombrero was born. We looked into current methods used by the visually impaired to help navigate numerous environments, but we were unhappy with the existing solutions. Our team designed a headpiece, equipped with an array of ultrasonic sensors, to measure distances within the user\u2019s field of vision in order to give them auditory feedback about their surrounding environment. The \u201cSuper Sombrero\u201d takes the sensor inputs and alerts the user when and where objects are detected in reference to them self through earphones or a speaker. Users are alerted of objects directly in front, slightly left, directly left, slightly right, or directly right of them if the object is within a preset threshold distance. Here is the link to a demonstration of our prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZKl-7IOoWw Our hope was that this headpiece could not only increase the mobility of visually impaired individuals, but also provide a sense of confidence to seek out the same opportunities and experiences as everyone else. A tertiary goal was to expand the domain of wearable tech to devices that could help the handicapped. Our team took our Grand Prize victory at Hakron as a form of preliminary product validation. This became inspiration to create a marketable product that will assist the blind and visually impaired in their everyday lives. Going forward, we plan to continue to develop this prototype by scaling it down to a practical size for everyday use in addition to increasing the precision and accuracy of the object detection.",

Lutron representative Will Howe presented the award to Xiaodong who is finishing his three terms of department chair and will return to his full-time faculty position. Established with an endowment by the Lutron Foundation in honor of the company\u2019s founders, the award recognizes professors in a selected group of top universities with excellent engineering programs, including CMU, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Michigan, MIT, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Penn State, and Purdue, for their accomplishments in teaching and education leaderships. Xiaodong was selected to chair the department in 2006 after a national search of two years. He joined the department from the College of William and Mary, where he was the Lettie Pate Evans Professor and Computer Science Department Chair.\u00a0 Since he became the Department Chair here, great changes have been taken place in CSE at Ohio State. In Mr. Howe\u2019s award presentation, he gave the following impressive numbers: \u2022 26 new faculty members have been hired since 2006, including several women and under representative minority members. More than half of the current tenure-track faculty in the department joined the department after 2006. \u2022 18 young faculty members received NSF Career Awards. The total number of the NSF Career awards in the department is 28, which is the highest record at Ohio State. \u2022 6 senior faculty members were elected to become Fellows of ACM and IEEE. \u2022 Three senior faculty members are named as University Distinguished Scholars. \u2022 Annual faculty research expenditure from external grants has been more than doubled and reached to $11M in 2017-18. \u2022 The department\u2019s graduate program is highly selective and is one of the largest in the college. More than 300 Ph.D. students have been graduated since 2006, which is more than half of the total number of Ph.D. graduates in the entire CSE history of 50 years. \u2022 The Computer Science graduate program ranking and Computer Engineering graduate program ranking have been steadily improved. In 2006, the computer engineering ranking was #23 by a score of 3.3. In the most recent ranking, the computer engineering ranking is #17 by a score 3.6. In 2006, the computer science ranking was #34 by a score of 3.2.

The department has graduated more than 3,000 undergraduate majors since 2006, which is more than 40% of the total number of CSE majors in the 50 year CSE history. \u2022 $1.5M endowment funds have been raised as named scholarships to support undergraduate and graduate students. Xiaodong also recieved a department service award presented at the banquet and he thanked the support and the honor given by colleagues and the Lutron Foundation.\u00a0 He said \u201cAll these accomplishments come from the talents, leaderships, hardworking, and collaborations among the students, staff members and the faculty. Keeping the current momentum, CSE will move to another level in the next 5-10 years.\u201d In addition to his busy administrative and professional service duties, Xiaodong has maintained a high profile research program. While the intellectual pursuit still maintains prominence in his research, Xiaodong also strives to transfer his research into advanced technology to impact general-purpose computing systems in both hardware and software. Several technical innovations and research results from his research group have been widely adopted in commercial processors, major operating systems and databases, and distributed systems.\u00a0 Among his list of Ph.D. graduates, 7 men and women have become faculty members in universities in the US, and 6 of them have received NSF Career Awards and DOD YIP award. Xiaodong\u2019s scholarship and leadership have been well recognized in the fields. He was named as IEEE Fellow (Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers) for his contributions to computer memory systems in 2009, and was named as ACM Fellow (Association for Computing Machinery) for his contributions to data and memory management in distributed systems in 2012.

Luckily, there\u2019s an organization at The Ohio State University that is dedicated to encouraging women and improving conditions in the computing field. The Association of Computing Machinery Women\u2019s Chapter at Ohio State\u2014or ACM-W@OSU\u2014began changing the educational experience for women on campus in 2003. What started as a small club has since evolved into a comprehensive provider of mentoring experiences for women. \u201cOur initial membership was less than 10 women undergrads. In those early years, we had one or two outreach events a quarter, and we worked hard to find sponsors,\u201d explained Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Senior Lecturer Bettina Bair, who founded the chapter and currently serves as faculty advisor. \u201cResearch shows that having a women-in-computing club on campus can increase students\u2019 confidence and enjoyment of their studies, help reduce their feelings of isolation, dispel common myths and stereotypes, and empower members to actively recruit and mentor others.\u201d ACM-W members attend the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. ACM-W members attend the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.Since its humble beginnings, ACM-W@OSU has grown significantly, both in size and impact. The chapter currently has approximately 30 active members who regularly attend meetings, and nearly 200 participating members attended one of 46 ACM-W events during the 2017-2018 academic year. While most members are either CSE or computer and information science majors, others are women in electrical and computer engineering, data analytics, mathematics or other engineering majors. Male students are also welcome, with a 40 percent average male representation at weekly meetings. Campbell \u201cACM-W supports diversity and inclusion by accepting anyone who wants to learn more about how they can support women in technical fields and then giving them multiple opportunities to learn how they could do so,\u201d said Co-President Courtney Campbell, a fourth year CSE major. \u201cThe organization also creates a safe space for women who have had hardships in technical environments and equips them with the tools to succeed.\u201d Activities emphasize mentoring, with professionals as well as college peers. Student leaders have developed strong ties with industry, increasing corporate sponsorship at least fourfold, which advisors say have led to promising careers at Nationwide Insurance, GE Aviation, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Corning. Industry sponsorship also enabled the club to send 40 students to the international Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in September 2018 in Houston. Middle school girls attend the 2018 Buck-i-Code workshop. ACM-W is looking out for the next generation as well, with middle and high school outreach programs that are computer science-focused. At the group\u2019s annual Buck-i-Code workshop, nearly 30 middle school girls come to campus for a day during which members showcase their research projects, such as self-flying drones, Python-programmed robots and language processing systems that can compete in Jeopardy. The event is twofold, as it not only teaches young girls about the world of computing, it builds confidence in the students leading the workshop. Another hallmark of the group is providing a safe space for members to talk openly among their peers about any hostile or difficult situations they\u2019ve encountered as women in the computing field. \u201cI love our lean-in socials because it\u2019s great to hear about what our members are dealing with and going through and then how they\u2019re working to improve the tech space for everyone,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cMy involvement has helped me find that I truly am not alone in the male-dominated industry,\u201d she added. \u201cI have my \u2018tribe,\u2019 or as I like to say those women in my life who constantly encourage me and push me to be who I am, despite any negative remarks I may hear. ACM-W is where I found the start to my tribe and it\u2019s where I now can help other women find theirs.\u201d by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu",

    "text_content": "Cybersecurity for everyone | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Cybersecurity for everyone Cybersecurity for everyone Posted: January 31, 2019 Increasingly, our critical information is pouring into technology. Phones and tablets. Banks and Amazon. Cars and drones. Do you know who has your Social Security number, your bank account information, your passwords? The guy next door? The Russians? The dark web? If you don\u2019t know, you might have something to worry about. Protecting your data takes education, awareness and understanding, said\u00a0Bryan Choi, an assistant professor in the the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Moritz College of Law. Choi explains why the effort is worth it. Q: Why is cybersecurity so crucial? A: Digital devices are embedded in our lives. It\u2019s no longer just computers and laptops; these devices are coming into our homes, our cars\u00a0and other private spaces. You can\u2019t live without computer technology touching your life, and yet most of these devices are being released without enough attention to software safety or security. The stakes are going up and we don\u2019t have any enforceable minimum standards. Q: What are some online safety basics people should know? A: The first step is data minimization. When someone asks you to share extra data such as a Social Security number, a picture\u00a0or an email address \u2014 ask yourself, why does it need to be on the internet? Why do you need a smart device listening to your conversations at home? Is that something you are comfortable with? Find out how your data can spread and what the risks are. Of course, none of us can live a life of data abstinence. So the second step is to develop good data habits. Q: What are some ways people can protect themselves? A: Practice good computer hygiene \u2014 update software, pay attention to security alerts, stay aware of issues that could happen. Don\u2019t click on spam, and don\u2019t click on suspicious links. If an email has a bunch of typos, or seems like it is out of character with the type of communication you normally see from a person, don\u2019t do anything it asks and forward it to an IT specialist. Pay attention to clues that something is amiss. The Electronic Frontier Foundation maintains excellent resources on\u00a0tips\u00a0and\u00a0tools\u00a0to use for self-defense: Get a password manager app or have an equivalent system that generates strong passwords across all the websites you use. Install browser extensions that protect against malware. Learn what incognito mode\u00a0does and does not do. Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources; be aware that many software publishers are willing to cheat and deceive you to access precious data on your phones and computers, even after you uninstall their apps. Maintain regular backups of your important files in case of a ransomware attack. If you have the opportunity, take a basic programming class so you get a grasp of how software works, why engineers make certain design decisions\u00a0and how code can go wrong. Q: What exactly are hackers after? A: It depends on your definition of hacker. We tend to think of hackers as anonymous strangers. It\u2019s true there are plenty of those. The most sophisticated attacks are carried out by, or on behalf of, U.S. or foreign governments who want intel they can use for tactical advantages. Other motivations can include financial profit, vigilantism\u00a0or vandalism. These broad-scale attacks, which include data breaches, are very common, but their effect on individuals is difficult to assess. The chance of being singled out from a pool of millions is relatively small, but the cost of being targeted can be dreadful. A good source to read up on cyberattacks is\u00a0Brian Krebs on Security. The most common cyber threats will likely come from the people closest to us. When an ex-partner, family member\u00a0or friend is angry and wants revenge, they can use your devices and your intimate information to hit you where it hurts most. Q: So should we panic when we hear about security breaches with companies that have our information? A: It\u2019s absolutely concerning. But it\u2019s such a big problem, and the internet is too useful to give up, that panic is probably not the right reaction. Instead, we should be looking for solutions that push the industry as a whole to improve its data security practices. Those efforts can be made at either the state, national\u00a0or international level. We will need many more people who can bridge computer engineering and law and policy to coordinate this campaign. from University Marketing's Ohio State Insights",

Angela Rucci is the founder of Tego. The OSU student used her background studying computer science engineering to create the technology, \"once you're in the app, you select where you're going, very similar to Uber and Lyft. And then you say who will be your notified contact or what we like to call your protector,\u201d explained Rucci. Tego\u2019s founder and creator said the app allows users to state where they\u2019re going and estimates how long their trip should take. Users can also select contacts to watch over them as they travel. When the user arrives to their destination safely, their contact is notified. Rucci explained the Tego app has built safety alerts if a person feels unsafe. The app user can activate a button that records video and audio from the phone, \u201cthis video is sent to my boyfriend, so he can follow along,\u201d said Rucci. According to Tego\u2019s website, if there\u2019s an emergency, the police could also get live footage on an incident. Rucci said the idea for creating the app came from an attack while grocery shopping, \"some person came up to me. I wasn't really paying attention while I was shopping, I was really into my podcast and he grabs on to me.\" Rucci is among six people who have worked on creating Tego. The name is short for protego which is Latin for protector. Angela got her project started at HackOHI/O this past fall. She will also be one of the spotlighted teams at ShowOHI/O on April 5. The app which is designed to protect, also has protections of its own, \"a pin code validates that I'm the one putting it in. So, if there was an attacker, he couldn't just go into phone and disable everything.\" The app is being tested for feedback. It will launch March 1st. Tego is free, can be used anywhere and will be available soon on iOS and android. Information on the app and how to download it can be found by visiting Tego\u2019s website .

    "text_content": "The Legacy of Mervin Muller at OSU (1985-1994) | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News The Legacy of Mervin Muller at OSU (1985-1994) The Legacy of Mervin Muller at OSU (1985-1994) Posted: March 12, 2019 On December 3, 2018, our beloved Mervin Muller passed away at age 90. A celebration of life was held on December 9, in Upper Arlington, Ohio. About 150 relatives and friends, including about 20 former and current CSE faculty and staff, as well as dozens of former chairs of other departments and colleagues, attended the brief service with a string quartet (J-AM) playing solemn music. Several of his old colleagues and former students also sent in their condolences and praises of his accomplishments, some of which were read during the service, which was followed by a warm and friendly reception. Regarding Mervin\u2019s education, extensive industrial and academic experiences, reputation for leadership, professional and social activities, we can find them on the CSE website posted on December 7, 2018, as well as his obituary published in the Columbus Dispatch. The purpose of this article is to document the legacy of Mervin Muller during his 9-year tenure as chair of the CSE (then CIS) Department from September 1985 to August 1994 (2 terms plus 1 year). Merv retired from OSU in 1998. Specifically, we can identify two significant infrastructural improvements and two important initiatives that have long lasting impacts on the Department\u2019s growth, success and further enhancement of its reputation for excellence in CSE, 25 years after his tenure as chair now and more decades to come! Before we go down to the detail, it is proper to report how Merv was recruited to OSU. Dean Glower took an extraordinary step of appointing the CSE chair search committee, chaired by Associate Dean Redmond, with members from a group of heads of Chemical Abstracts Service, Battelle, OCLC and Mead Data Central; faculty from other departments; and our own Bruce Weide. An executives search firm, Heidrick & Struggles, was hired to help the search. Merv was interviewed three times. The first time it was held at Merv\u2019s office at the World Bank in Washington, DC, where he served as Director of Computing Activities. The purpose of the visit was to assess Merv\u2019s interest in the position, and he made a strong impression on those who interviewed him, including\u00a0 Bruce Weide. In the ensuing negotiation, both President Jennings and Dean Glower were convinced by Merv that a top university needs a top CSE department, and both agreed to provide additional funds to hire senior faculty and to greatly enhance our computing facility. President Jennings also promised to allow Merv to find funding for a CSE building. At the third time Heidrick & Struggles interviewed Merv, he accepted the offer to be the CSE chair. 1. Dreese Lab II. When the CSE Department was formally established in September 1968, it was housed in the fourth floor of Caldwell Lab. As the Department grew in size, it moved to the second floor of Bolz Hall in 1975. The rapid growth of both faculty and student enrollment in the late 1970s and early 1980s created a space problem that our offices were scattered in several adjacent buildings, namely, Hitchcock Hall, Communication Lab, Welding Engineering and Ives Hall. With the promise of President Jennings, Merv started to search for \u00a0funds for a new building, and within three years he raised $22 million. Ground breaking of the new building took place in September 1992, and it was completed in November 1993. The Department started moving to occupy the new building in the spring of 1994, which can house all offices and several new labs under one roof! The new building, named Dresse Lab II, was dedicated on October 28, 1994, by President Gordon Gee. The dedication was held in conjunction with the CSE 25th Anniversary Celebration and Reunion, which was originally scheduled on October 8-9, 1993. About 300 persons (faculty, staff, students, alumni, friends and distinguished guests) attended the 2-day joint celebration. Merv was also a member of the OSU Arts Council and got them agree to his selection of an artist for art works on the exterior of the building, named the Garden of Numbers. The Garden is still a beautiful sight that many enjoy. It is one of top attractions on campus for visitors. Many people take their pictures inside the zero (0), thinking it is the O of Ohio State. However, it does not matter since CSE is a part of OSU. 2. IICF (Interactive Instructional Computing Facility) . Merv also raised $4.6 million for a 6-year plan to establish IIFC which has provided a state-of-the-art distributed but integrated interactive instructional facility. It included individual PCs/workstations integrated through a network to a shared file system as well as other network-wide services such as printer servers. Initial implementation included 305 Apple Macintoshes, 43 AT&T UNIX PCs, 20 Sun workstations, 4 IBM PCs, 4 DEC LSI 11/23s, and others, which were scattered in 6 adjacent buildings: Bolz, Hitchcock, Welding Engineering, Caldwell, Hagerty and Baker. During Merv\u2019s 9-year tenure, those old and aging PCs/workstations were upgraded and replaced with new ones. When he stepped down as chair in1994, IIFC had 300 HP 715/64s, 208 Sun SPARCs, 100 Sun SLCs, 61 Sun ELCs, and others. The IICF technical staff consists of a full-time manager and several professionals as well as part-time graduate and undergraduate students whose focus is the implementation, development and deployment of cutting-edge technologies to facilitate instruction as well as research. They also provide technical support to several CSE research labs in AI, databases, graphics, networking, parallel computing, and performance evaluation. The establishment of the technical staff within IICF was an important milestone of the CSE Department. It has now become a part of the College of Engineering Technology Service staff, providing computing service to the College in addition to the CSE Department. 3. Buckeye Byte. The first initiative by Merv that has a longtime impact was the publication of a departmental newsletter, Buckeye Bytes, to supplement the department\u2019s annual report which was started by Marshall Yovits (founding chair, 1968-1978) for the academic year, July 1976 to June 1977. The purpose of the newsletter is to serve as a vehicle for exchanging information, in a frequent and timely way, about activities and events affecting CSE alumni, faculty and students. A new staff member, Virginia (Strawser) Jenkins, who was major in English, was recruited to serve as Editor of both Buckeye Bytes and the CSE Annual Report. The inaugural issue was published in Spring 1987, featuring the department\u2019s 20th Anniversary celebration during the academic year 1986-87. Six well-known guest speakers from industry, academia and government, including Fred Kilgore (OCLC founder; October 9, 1986) and Rear Admiral Grace Hopper (COBOL inventor; February 5, 1987), were invited to deliver their speeches in the Distinguished Lecture Series as a part of the celebration. The scope of Buckeye Bytes has been expanded and renamed as Buckeye Blog by Xiaoding Zhang (chair, 2006-2018). The first issue was published in Autumn 2007, in colorful print as well as on the CSE website. In addition to Buckeye Bytes\u2019 regular features, Buckeye Blog has started publishing a list of names of CSE alumni and friends who directed their OSU gifts to CSE. As a result, CSE is able to set up more scholarships to support both undergraduate and graduate students for education and research. 4. Advisory Board. The CSE Advisory Board was formed by Merv in May 1987 and held its first meeting in conjunction with the College of Engineering\u2019s annual ACE (Alliance with the College of Engineering) celebration. It consists of a highly knowledgeable group of individuals who help review, evaluate and make recommendations on matters pertaining to the instructional, research and service roles of the Department. The inaugural members were high-level executives and managers from IBM, HP, Apple, Pyramid Technology, Battelle, OCLC, Chemical Abstracts Service, NIH, MIT and GMU; one private consultant, and 2 CSE distinguished alumni, a total of 13. Over the years the membership has been changed and expanded. David Cohen, a distinguished CSE alumnus who also served on the College\u2019s Advisory Board for many years, is the longest continuing member since 1988. The formation of the Advisory Board is another milestone of the CSE Department. In addition to its advisory roles, the Advisory Board has been helpful in fund raising for the Department and in the accreditation of its undergraduate program by the ABET/CSAB. In addition to the aforementioned achievements, Merv also recruited 31 full-time, tenure-track faculty members, including two full and one associate professors. Two of the assistant professors, both recruited from USC in 1989, DeLang Wang and D.K. Panda, have received OSU\u2019s top research award, the Distinguished Scholar Award, which is\u00a0 given to only six faculty members out of more than 3,000 each year. As of now, the Department has five recipients, and two have retired. The graduate program was greatly expanded, both in enrollment and the number of MS/PhD degrees awarded, during Merv\u2019s tenure. There are many other Merv\u2019s contributions, which can be found in the Buckeye Bytes and the Annual Reports from 1985 to 1994. In summary Merv worked his best to lead the Department on a path to excellence and relevance, that is, to bring in a real-world perspective that was needed to typical university settings. Only time can tell how much success he made to the Department!",

Alan\u2019s five-year project, entitled \u201cLarge-Scale Learning for Information Extraction\u201d, will substantially advance the capability of machines to read large document collections and reason about the knowledge contained within them using minimal human effort.\u00a0 This will help people to overcome information overload and make better decisions by analyzing vital information that is locked away in unstructured text. The research will address the machine reading data bottleneck by inventing new methods that can learn effectively from large, noisy datasets using distant supervision. These methods will address the challenge of label noise inherent in distant supervision by performing inference over latent variables during learning, filling in missing information, and resolving ambiguities. The approach combines the benefits of structured learning and neural networks. This will catalyze the rapid development of extractors for many new tasks and domains.\u00a0 Furthermore, the research will push the boundaries of minimal supervision for Information Extraction by exploring new applications that demonstrate the generality of the approach, including entity, relation and event extraction, time normalization and learning to extract a real-time feed of cyber-threat intelligence using distant supervision from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This research effort will support the rapid development of information systems for a broad range of new tasks and domains using minimal human effort. Alan joined the department of Computer Science and Engineering in 2014.\u00a0 Prior to joining OSU, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University.\u00a0 He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington.",

While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms. PNAS is one of the world\u2019s most-cited and comprehensive multidisciplinary scientific journals, publishing more than 3,200 research papers annually.

Named \u201cConvergent Graduate Training and EmPOWERment for a Sustainable Energy Future,\u201d this grant supports a new interdisciplinary graduate specialization in sustainable energy at Ohio State. During its first four years, the EmPOWERment program anticipates training 80 Ph.D. students, including 32 funded trainees from diverse fields including industrial and systems, environmental, and electrical and computer engineering; public policy; computer science; economics; materials science; and geography. Thereafter, the program anticipates training at least 20 Ph.D. students each year. Development of the program will begin immediately and launch in autumn 2020. Ramteen Sioshansi, a professor and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering, is the principal investigator, leading a core team of faculty drawn from seven colleges across the university. EmPOWERment will develop a community of practice for students interested in sustainable energy; several new courses; a summer research program for targeted student recruitment; and multiple engagement opportunities with industry, and will create more than 32 one-year stipends for NRT fellows, targeted to female and underrepresented minority students. \u201cThis NRT grant is a game-changer,\u201d says Sioshansi. \u201cIt recognizes that Ohio State has all of the requisite pieces to provide students with this type of training. However, the grant allows us to connect the pieces into a coherent and holistic student experience. The energy landscape is evolving rapidly and future leaders in the energy industry will need transdisciplinary training to be able to keep pace with and drive the necessary transformations to decarbonize energy production and use.\u201d Ohio State has a strong commitment to the development and sustainability of new convergent approaches to graduate education that better serve the next generation of STEM researchers, engage industry partners, enhance our ability to attract and retain underrepresented minority students, and address the needs of the nation's future workforce. The university has invested heavily in both interdisciplinary research and sustainable energy. \u201cThe NRT strengthens Ohio State's ability to create knowledge and educate students to be leaders in solving the societal challenges of sustainable energy systems,\u201d says Bruce McPheron, Ohio State Executive Vice-President and Provost. \u201cWe have invested heavily in convergent knowledge creation and training and in sustainable energy, and we are pleased that this program will increase the capacity and impact of both investments. Multiple energy-sector partners will join faculty and graduate students to create a high-level innovation ecosystem using Ohio State\u2019s campus as a real-world test bed. Companies submitting letters of support for the program include American Electric Power, Cargill, ENGIE, First Solar, Huntington, Siemens, and Worthington Industries. In addition, Los Alamos National Laboratories, Ohio Energy Project, and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio endorsed the program. EmPOWERment brings together a core group of 16 Ohio State faculty from seven colleges (Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Human Ecology, Engineering, Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Law, and Public Affairs) with the involvement of multiple centers and institutes (Sustainability Institute, Institute for Materials Research, and Battelle Center), university offices and programs (Graduate School and Office of Diversity and Inclusion), and over a dozen external industry partners, led by ENGIE, Ohio State\u2019s energy-management partner. ENGIE will participate in the NRT by including Ohio State graduate students in projects that will aid in achieving the university\u2019s goal of a zero-carbon Columbus campus by 2050. \"I don\u2019t think the energy industry can respond fast enough to society\u2019s demand for a zero-carbon path with conventional on-the-job training,\u201d says Serdar Tufekci, Vice President, Business Development for ENGIE North America. \u201cWhere technical and financial expertise used to be sufficient, this is no longer the case. The ability to function across multi-disciplines is now a requirement for the digitalized distributed and renewable energy solutions.\u201d The EmPOWERment program leverages Ohio State\u2019s 50-year partnership with ENGIE to support energy research, operations, and campus sustainability, by providing trainees with concrete opportunities to develop novel digital and physical components such as batteries, materials, and algorithms; integrated assessment, optimization, and predictive modeling capabilities for future scenarios; and new policies, educational mechanisms, and business strategies Ohio State Faculty engaged with the EmPOWERment Program Principal Investigator: Ramteen Sioshansi (Integrated Systems Engineering) Co-Principal Investigators: Jeff Bielicki (Civil, Environmental, Geodetic Engineering and Glenn College of Public Affairs) Elena Irwin (Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics and Sustainability Institute) Matt Mayhew (Education and Human Ecology) Rajiv Ramnath (Computer Science and Engineering) Additional Core Team Members: Anant Agarwal (Electrical and Computer Engineering) Noah Dormady (Glenn College of Public Affairs) Elizabeth Newton (Glenn College of Public Affairs, Battelle Center, Integrated Systems Engineering) Steven Quiring (Geography and Translational Data Analytics Institute) Jay Sayre (Institute for Materials Research Innovation Lab) Additional Non-Core Faculty: Christian Blanco (Fisher College of Business and Materials and Manufacturing for Sustainability) Cinnamon Carlarne (Law) Jeffrey Froyd (Engineering Education) Jeffrey Jacquet (School of Environment and Natural Resources) Ajay Shah (Food, Agricultural, Biological Engineering) Nicole Sintov (School of Environment and Natural Resources and Sustainability Institute)",

The Ohio State University is one of 35 colleges and universities across the state to receive support from the Choose Ohio First program. The new scholarships will boost Ohio\u2019s efforts to strengthen the state\u2019s workforce in technology-related fields such as coding and cybersecurity. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Department of Higher Education Chancellor Randy Gardner announced the details of the program today. \u201cThe Choose Ohio First program is one of our state\u2019s best tools to increase the number of students preparing to work in STEM-related fields,\u201d Husted said. \u201cIn today\u2019s technology-infused economy, every industry and business has important tech-focused jobs and training Ohioans for careers in those positions is key to growing our economy.\u201d A total of $20,580,770 will be awarded over the next five years and support 1,400 students. The grant for Ohio State is $2,582,790. \u201cThis support will advance learning in areas vital to workforce development and Ohio\u2019s innovation economy,\u201d said President Michael V. Drake. The Choose Ohio First scholarship program began in 2008 as a way to increase the number of Ohio students enrolling in and successfully completing science, technology, engineering, math\u00a0and medicine (STEMM) programs at the state\u2019s public and independent colleges and universities. Husted, who was Ohio House Speaker at the time, led the efforts to create the program. The scholarships are part of a strategy to increase enrollment and completion in computer science and related areas. ODHE is also promoting the use of the funds to assist students to obtain credentials and certificates in computer science areas, allowing them to add more demonstrated skills to their portfolio. Community colleges, independent four-year colleges and universities, and public four-year universities are receiving funds. Gardner said this range of school participation demonstrates the commitment of Ohio\u2019s higher education community to respond to student interests and the state\u2019s economic needs.

    "text_content": "Meeting the needs of students, any way necessary | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Meeting the needs of students, any way necessary Meeting the needs of students, any way necessary Posted: April 13, 2020 Like course coordinators across the university,\u00a0Diana Kline\u00a0had to figure out the best way to support students as they transitioned to remote learning during the coronavirus outbreak. In this case, there were a lot of students to think about, many in their first year. In addition, she needed to consider the international students who were returning to their countries only to be stuck in quarantine. Kline oversees and teaches CSE 2111, a pre-requisite for business students that covers the basics of Microsoft Excel and Access. The course, which falls under the Computer Science and Engineering umbrella, serves more than 1,100 students in nine sections on the Columbus campus this semester, and another 200 on the regional campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of work, but we have a great team of lecturers,\u201d Kline said. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s been a smooth transition, and it certainly helped that one of the nine sections was already an online class.\u201d Besides Kline, the team includes\u00a0Catherine McKinley,\u00a0Laurie Crawford,\u00a0Clair Farris\u00a0and\u00a0Mark Jackson\u00a0on the Columbus campus, and\u00a0Amber Rader\u00a0in Mansfield,\u00a0Fred Crowner\u00a0in Newark,\u00a0Nicoleta Roman\u00a0in Lima and\u00a0Nima Mansouri\u00a0in Marion. While the eight sections were being adapted for distance learning with the support of the college\u2019s technology services department \u2014 a time McKinley describes as sleep-deprived 12-hour days \u2014 Associate Chair\u00a0Rephael Wenger\u00a0made sure instructors were contacting students to check on their connectivity and to make sure nobody fell through the cracks. \u201cNow, we\u2019re tracking participation,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cWe\u2019re checking to see if students are logging into Carmen Canvas. Are they attending our live Zoom lectures during class time or viewing the recorded lectures later on? Are they completing assignments?\u201d For students who might be struggling during the transition, Kline made sure there\u2019s plenty of help available. She set up a virtual tutor room that\u2019s open from 11:30 to 5:30 Monday through Friday. Students can connect by Zoom to speak to a teaching assistant. At any given time, two or three TAs are on duty, and for problems needing special attention, either Kline or McKinley is available to help. Kline and her team also recognized the unique challenges that international students would face once they returned home. To begin with, the students would invariably go into quarantine, where internet access might not be reliable or even available. On top of that, there was the time difference. For example, when the virtual tutor room opens at 11:30 a.m., a student in Shanghai \u2013 12 hours ahead of Columbus \u2014 might be asleep for the night. As a result, Kline is considering opening the tutor room at 9 a.m. McKinley had even offered to get up at 3 in the morning to staff the room. \u201cThankfully, we\u2019ve been so responsive to the students, we\u2019ve heard very few complaints,\u201d Kline said. \u201cStudents can email me any time of day, and then I can arrange to do an individual Zoom session with them. The same is true of the other instructors and TAs. So, if a student wants to connect with us at 8 in the morning, which for a student in China might be 8 at night, we could easily accommodate that.\u201d Practically speaking, there are no \u201coff\u201d days for the team. Instructors routinely monitor their emails, and on a recent Sunday, when students were required to submit a Carmen quiz and two labs, McKinley was online from 10 in the morning until she went to bed just after midnight. The next day, based on the assignments received, Kline had a valuable insight: the vast majority of students \u2013 more than 95% \u2013 were participating. \u201cThe transition to online courses has been going surprisingly smoothly,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut we continue to be worried about the couple of students in each class who might not be able to connect and continue their education either because of technology problems or personal situations. We are trying to identify them and connect them with the appropriate resources.\u201d To read more Stories of Resolve click here .",

    "text_content": "A profile in teaching: Jim Davis | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News A profile in teaching: Jim Davis A profile in teaching: Jim Davis Posted: April 13, 2020 Feeling as though he was often competing with Twitter, Facebook and email for his students\u2019 attention, Professor Jim Davis decided to try something new. For the first time in his 20-year teaching career, he prohibited the use of laptops, tablets and phones in class. Accommodations were made to ensure accessibility for all students. While a classroom limiting students\u2019 access to these technologies might sound counterintuitive for a computer science and engineering course, Davis said it yielded one of the most interactive classroom experiences he\u2019s encountered in decades. Davis\u2019 decision to go technology-free was inspired, in part, by readings on classroom improvements and student engagement that he encountered in the Teaching Support Program , a professional learning opportunity for Ohio State faculty developed by the University Institute for Teaching and Learning. \u201cJim\u2019s experience shows how even our most seasoned faculty members can learn new approaches to make the classroom experience more engaging,\u201d said Kay Halasek, director of the University Institute for Teaching and Learning. \u201cWe aim to empower faculty to select the most effective approach for their classes \u2014 which can mean expanding the use of technology, using it in different ways, scaling back, or employing any number of other approaches to engage students, meet learning objectives and ensure accessibility for all students.\u201d According to Davis, the TSP was an opportunity to reflect on his pedagogy, identify gaps in his current teaching practice and implement evidence-based techniques he had never considered before. Davis describes his experience in the TSP below. What was your motivation for taking part in the Teaching Support Program? It was an opportunity to examine what I currently do and compare with (evidence-based approaches from) the Teaching Support Program. I have already received teaching awards, but there is always room for improvement. Teaching is technically one thing that we are never actually trained to do. As graduate students, we may have done research, but we may have never TA\u2019ed a class. How has the TSP supported or changed your approach to teaching? The Teaching Support Program really did reaffirm a lot of my existing practices, but it also opened the door to a few areas that I didn't really think about that I could explore. How so? One of the proposed techniques I implemented was to have the students fill out a form with their own self-assessment and justifications for various forms of participation. I had never thought about something like that before. I made sure the students saw it ahead of time, so that they knew what they were going to be assessed on. At the end of the course, I had them do a self-assessment about whether they were interacting in class and if their questions related back to the material. I think this process gave them more control and expectation on their participation. There was also some discussion in the TSP about technology and paying attention in the classroom. During the autumn semester, I disallowed the use of laptops or tablets in my class. As I stood in front of the class lecturing, every eyeball in the class was on me. Students were engaged. They were making comments, raising their hands and asking questions. One thing that I haven\u2019t done yet, but that I picked up from the TSP, is that I would like to have students write down their expectations for the course before it starts, like on the first day of class. I think it will be a good way for them to gauge whether they\u2019re going in the expected direction. The second component of the TSP requires participants to read one book and three articles and then reflect on how they can apply the material to their own teaching practice. Did any selection from the reading list make a lasting impression on you? Quick Hits for New Faculty: Successful Strategies by Award-Winning Teachers .(link is external)\u00a0I chose this book, even though I am no longer a new faculty member and have received teaching awards, to reflect on how my initial years correspond to the material, to judge what I would have done differently, and how it may still affect my current teaching methodology. What are they telling new faculty to do? Was I doing the right things as a junior faculty? And furthermore, am I doing the right things now? If I was in charge of new faculty or any new hires, I would give them this book to read. Would you recommend the TSP to your peers? I would absolutely recommend this program. I feel more confident in what I\u2019m doing, which should naturally translate to the classroom. As an instructor, you should feel good about the practices you\u2019re using, and with the Teaching Support Program, you\u2019ve got support for that. ABOUT THE TEACHING SUPPORT PROGRAM The Teaching Support Program (TSP) has three components: Teaching Practices Inventory : Establishes baseline data about current teaching practices Teaching@OhioState/UITL Reading List\u00a0and Reflection : Online modules share evidence-based practices; readings encourage reflection Instructional Redesign : Opportunities to implement evidence-based practices in a course. UITL is currently developing two cohorts for Instructional Redesign that focus on Carmen Common Sense (design of the LMS) and Intentional Technology. Learn more here .",

Prof. Sun's project will contribute a new, learnable interactive QA model, which will detect the ambiguities and uncertainties during the answering process and interact with users in a natural fashion to seek clarifications. Moreover, the QA model will learn from such interactions to simultaneously improve answer quality and reduce human intervention over time, using imitation and reinforcement learning based frameworks. This project will further advance the QA model with a novel question decomposition component, which decomposes a compositional question into simpler sub-questions and can enhance the transparency of the answering procedure by allowing users to validate the sub-questions (i.e., confirming or correcting the sub-questions). To effectively train the QA model with limited human cost (for providing feedback or training data), the team will explore new learning strategies such as designing user simulators and weak supervision mechanisms. When applying the QA model to the clinical domain, this project will develop novel solutions to domain-specific challenges, such as how to incorporate background biomedical knowledge into a general QA model and how to create high-quality clinical QA datasets at a low cost. The team will closely collaborate with doctors and physicians for model evaluation and actively seek technology transfer opportunities. All datasets, software and demos will be publicly accessible via the investigator's website. Potential research findings will be disseminated in computer science and medical informatics related venues and will be integrated into existing and new courses.",

Buckeye engineers (from left) McKenzie Kennelly, Natalie Amling and Allison Cuba are the engineering team behind Sitti, a free online marketplace for care services. As Sitti\u2019s engineering team, the trio is developing a platform for care services that, unlike its competitors, is free to users. Sitti is funded by Drive Capital and began rolling out features in January to a limited number of families and sitters residing in a Columbus suburb. While building their product and startup during the COVID-19 crisis, these computer science and engineering majors are also expanding Sitti\u2019s reach to provide free childcare to first responders. \u201cWe spent a couple of weeks at the end of March watching all this stuff happen and realizing that we\u2019re in a very different position than a lot of college students,\u201d Amling said. \u201cWe have a platform to do something about it.\u201d The team raised $20,000 from donors, including a contribution from Sitti, to provide free babysitting to 40 central Ohio families. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing experience to help them out. We\u2019ve gotten the most heart-warming feedback,\u201d Amling shared. \u201cBut we did have to scale faster than we were ready to.\u201d While the original goal was to help first responders, their impact has gone even farther. \u201cDuring coronavirus, the sitters have increased exponentially, because sitters need financial relief,\u201d explained Kennelly. \u201cSo not only are we helping first responders, but we\u2019re helping sitters who are out of work and need a job, and we were able to give them a job.\u201d Sitti is the brainchild of central Ohio native Olivia Weinstock and Chris Olsen, a partner at venture capital firm Drive Capital. When Weinstock moved north to attend the University of Michigan, she contacted her longstanding babysitting clients and offered to recommend reliable replacement sitters and coordinate the arrangements. Olsen was one of those clients. He not only took Weinstock up on her offer, but also suggested she turn her idea into a business. But Olsen knew Weinstock would need some help. Amling, who was an intern at Drive Capital at the time, was brought on as a technical co-founder. When the team needed a second engineer, Amling recruited Kennelly, who she worked with on a game design class project, as another technical co-founder. That was in August 2019. In September, the trio successfully pitched Drive Capital and received funding. After realizing they\u2019d need another engineer to get Sitti up and running, the engineers recruited Cuba, another classmate. Double majoring in art, Cuba splits her time between coding and design. From September to January, the team started rolling out Sitti\u2019s basic features, including an app and texting platform. They also began signing up families and sitters in Bexley, the Columbus suburb where Weinstock grew up. Their plan was to perfect their product with a limited number of users before expanding to Columbus and then other cities. But the pandemic hit and the team decided to quickly scale up to serve first responders. Within the next six months, they plan to replace their texting platform with a web portal and open Sitti up to anyone in the Columbus area. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve found with Sitti is we pretty much always do something that we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re quite ready for, then it ends up being fine,\u201d explained Amling. When the team needs confirmation that they\u2019re ready to take the next step or other advice, they\u2019ve gotten it from Drive Capital, which also provides the startup with office space in addition to funding, Kennelly said. Instead of charging families or sitters like its competitors, Sitti collects a small transaction fee, paid by the merchant or retailer, each time its debit cards are swiped by sitters or money is added to them. \u201cEven if you have the best platform in the world, if you are charging sitters or families every time, eventually once those sitters and families establish a relationship, they\u2019ll probably leave the platform,\u201d Amling said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that the combination of a good platform and it being free sets us apart.\u201d The time involved in launching a startup was initially a shock to the engineers. Kennelly worked and went to school full-time spring semester in order to graduate in May. Amling took the semester off to focus on Sitti, while Cuba is taking classes part-time. \u201cI really worked my butt off to get this far and to be so close to the finish line and push it back is tough,\u201d Cuba said. \u201cBut I get to work 50/50 between art and engineering, which is something I never thought I was going to be able to do.\u201d While working at a startup can be challenging, the trio has discovered even greater rewards. \u201cThe biggest reward for me has been the personal growth and knowing we are capable and good engineers,\u201d said Amling. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to do to know.\u201d \u201cThis is the best experience of my entire life,\u201d added Kennelly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much about engineering, about how to make a product and working with a team in an effective way.\u201d by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu",

    "text_content": "Five decades of computer science and engineering at Ohio State | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Five decades of computer science and engineering at Ohio State Five decades of computer science and engineering at Ohio State Posted: April 3, 2020 Students in a computer lab in 1988. In 1969, computer science was in its infancy. That year marked the first time computers were networked together at large scale, the underpinning of most industries today. It also marked the first full academic year of the Department of Computer and Information Science within The Ohio State University College of Engineering. In 2003, the department name changed to\u00a0Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). From 1955 to 1963, most of Ohio State\u2019s computer sciences courses were taught in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, the Instruction and Research Computer Center was only a small computing center consisting of one machine with the capabilities of today\u2019s simple pocket calculators. In November 1965, the university published a report on the growing popularity of computer science among students. The year before, 1,130 students were enrolled in computer classes, 280 in non-credit seminars, and there were 231 theses and dissertations on the topic of computers. Inaugural CSE Chair Marshall Yovits led the department from 1969 to 1978. Under the leadership of Chair Marshall Yovits, the new department\u2019s headquarters were located in Caldwell Laboratory, across the street from its current home in Dreese Laboratories. The predominant computers were IBM System/360 Model 50 and Model 75. For comparison, five Model 75 computers housed at NASA's Real-Time Computer Complex were used during the Apollo program. With 15 faculty members and 11 supplemental instructors from the university and industry in 1969, the Department of Computer and Information Science offered 64 courses to 350 undergrads and 142 graduate students. Research focus areas included information storage and retrieval, human information processing, linguistics analysis and\u2014although it seems extremely new right now\u2014artificial intelligence (AI). In an article from the College of Engineering\u2019s magazine at the time, Yovits was credited with transforming the study of information science at Ohio State from a few computer-related courses to full department status with an approved doctorate program. He considered himself a fortunate scientist whose specialty was gaining the respect that sometimes eludes other disciplines. At a 1968 University Board of Trustees meeting, President Novice Fawcett said the Department of Computer Information and Science \u201cwill offer a broad spectrum of courses \u2026 in a well-defined academic endeavor which has become recognized internationally as an appropriate scientific discipline.\u201d A student using a computer in 1975 (courtesy of The Ohio State University Archives) By 1974, the Department of Computer and Information Science had \u201cthree times as many students and more than twice the number of courses than it did when established six years ago,\u201d according to a\u00a0Lantern\u00a0article. Today, a time when most aspects of our lives are somehow shaped by computer science,\u00a0approximately 2,500 undergrads and 290 graduate students learn from and innovate with 48 CSE faculty members led by Interim Chair Tamal Dey. Research concentrations include AI, high performance computing, computer graphics, networking, software systems, data management and mining, and theory and algorithms. Total annual research expenditures stand around $10 million, double that of 2006. \u201cThis unprecedented growth brings challenges as well as opportunities, which the department is well-positioned to handle,\u201d Dey said. CSE faculty are highly regarded in their respective fields; the department boasts multiple prestigious awards and fellowships from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, among others. The last decade has seen a number of initiatives spearheaded by faculty and students gain national attention. This includes the\u00a0Translational Data Analytics Institute, the launch of one of the first\u00a0data analytics degree programs\u00a0in the world, an NSF Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) award, and the\u00a0HackOHI/O hackathon, which hosts more than 800 students for a weekend in the Ohio Union. Additionally, Professor DK Panda is a co-principal investigator on a $60 million project with the Texas Advanced Computing Center to develop the largest supercomputer at any U.S. university and among the most powerful in the world. A computer lab in 1987 (courtesy of The Ohio State University Archives) At the time of writing this article, the CSE department is navigating uncharted territory due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Faculty, staff and students have united to pull together its resources for delivering online instruction to one of the largest student bodies in the nation and to continue its cutting-edge research in computing. \u201cIt is this spirit that has fostered the growth in CSE over the past 50 years,\u201d Dey said, \u201cand it is this spirit that will propel CSE to march forward in a world that is becoming increasingly computational.\u201d",

She is an assistant professor at Ohio State in the\u00a0Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The CAREER award is the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) most prestigious award in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of both. The overall goal of Sun\u2019s project, \u201cTowards Interactive and Transparent Question Answering with Applications in the Clinical Domain\u201d is to develop a new intelligent question answering (QA) model that can interact with users to resolve ambiguity and uncertainty during the answering process. \u201cFinding relevant information quickly is integral to effective and efficient decision making, but this becomes increasingly difficult as the scale and heterogeneity of data continue to grow rapidly,\u201d explained Sun. QA systems, which aim to find precise answers to natural language questions from users, have shown great potential to address this problem. However, state-of-the-art QA systems still largely fall short in various scenarios: when questions are ambiguous or complex; when answering questions requires background knowledge not readily available in the data; and when users need to understand the system\u2019s answering process in order to judge trustworthiness. Prof. Huan Sun \u201cThese scenarios are prevalent in real application domains of QA, including healthcare, finance and sciences, and must be addressed when building practical systems,\u201d said Sun. Her project will develop a novel interactive QA model, which will detect the ambiguities and uncertainties during the answering process and interact with users in a natural fashion to seek clarifications. Additionally, the QA model will learn from such interactions to simultaneously improve answer quality and reduce human intervention over time, using imitation and reinforcement learning-based frameworks. Sun\u2019s project further aims to improve the QA model\u2019s transparency by decomposing a complex question into several intermediate sub-questions and allowing users to validate them. \u201cWe expect our results will contribute to future human-technology partnership by enabling QA models to be more interactive, more transparent and therefore more trustworthy,\u201d she said. The proposed QA model will be tested in the clinical domain, where doctors often ask questions about a patient and look for answers in electronic medical records (EMRs). Sun\u2019s model may enable doctors to effectively and efficiently query EMRs and gather relevant evidence for critical decision making. The project also includes plans for integrating research and education. The research team will work closely with healthcare providers for model evaluation and actively seek technology transfer opportunities. All datasets, software and demos will be publicly accessible. Research findings will be disseminated in computer science and medical informatics-related venues, and will be integrated into existing and new courses. Sun\u2019s research team will engage high school students and undergraduates, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and prepare them for future education and employment opportunities. Her previous QA research, which utilizes\u00a0human-machine collaboration to improve question answering, has been funded by the Army Research Office (ARO), an element of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command\u2019s Army Research Laboratory. Sun joined The Ohio State University in 2016. Prior to that, she was a visiting scientist at the University of Washington. She earned her PhD in computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and her bachelor\u2019s in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu Category: College of Engineering Related News There are currently no related news items.

Zahra Atiq The new, multi-institutional program, QuSTEAM: Convergent Undergraduate Education in Quantum Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Accelerator , aims to change how quantum information science and technology is taught throughout the U.S. The rapidly evolving field of quantum information science will enable transformative technologies that will have significant impact on our economy and society. Reaching that promise, however, requires developing a large quantum-ready workforce that can meet growing demand for skilled workers across the communications, optics, computing\u00a0and materials industries. \u201cQuantum information science is a shift in the way technology works,\u201d said\u00a0Ezekiel Johnston-Halperin, professor in Ohio State\u2019s\u00a0Department of Physics\u00a0and the project\u2019s lead investigator. \u201cThat requires a fundamentally different skillset and knowledge base than a traditional STEM degree offers, and as a result, we need a new educational approach for training a quantum-ready workforce.\u201d Along with Johnston-Halperin, QuSTEAM's Ohio State contingent includes: co-PI Andrew Heckler, professor of physics and physics education research specialist;\u00a0Zahra Atiq, assistant professor of practice, computer science and engineering;\u00a0David Delaine\u00a0and\u00a0Emily Dringenberg, assistant professors of engineering education;\u00a0Edward Fletcher, associate professor of educational studies in the College of Education and Human Ecology; and\u00a0Chris Porter, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics. \u201cThe goal of this project is to\u00a0develop a revolutionary curriculum that will provide a model for the national education of those who will lead the emerging field of quantum information science and technology that integrates best practices for inclusiveness and convergent disciplinarity,\u201d said Dringenberg. David Delaine The three engineering professors will bring theoretical and methodological expertise to the core research team. Specifically, they will support implementation of data collection via focus groups and surveys across stakeholders from academia, industry, and the national lab system to determine teaching and learning needed to develop a diverse quantum workforce.\u00a0Atiq, Delaine and Dringenberg also will help develop data analysis plans and provide insight on how diversity, inclusion and equity remain a challenge in the development of STEM curriculum. QuSTEAM will develop modules built around single concepts that can be arranged to shape an array of educational paths \u2014 from bachelor\u2019s and associate\u2019s degrees to certificates and minors. The modular curriculum would provide educational opportunities for two- and four-year institutions, minority-serving institutions and industries. It addresses the need for diversity and inclusion in both STEM education and the STEM workforce, systematically building a structure that works to undo barriers that have historically limited inclusivity. By incorporating content beyond traditional STEM disciplines and gearing the modules toward project-based evaluation to broaden participation, QuSTEAM aims to focus on inclusivity while confronting and dismantling longstanding biases in order to advance diversity Emily Dringenberg across STEM fields. \u201cTurning out large numbers of high-quality undergraduates who excel in their fields and have a significant impact in the economy is something Ohio State and our partners do well already,\u201d Johnston-Halperin said. \u201cQuantum information science is a rapidly growing field and we are positioned to be early actors with the opportunity to innovate in a way that will serve the whole community. The QuSTEAM group is optimally positioned to fill that urgent need.\u201d based on College of Arts and Sciences article",

    "text_content": "Using AI to improve reading proficiency, accessibility | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Using AI to improve reading proficiency, accessibility Using AI to improve reading proficiency, accessibility Posted: April 15, 2020 Reading is one of the best ways to gain knowledge and access information, but many people in the U.S. struggle with illiteracy. Thankfully, a team of engineers from The Ohio State University is helping make text content more accessible for all. Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash A team led by\u00a0Computer Science and Engineering\u00a0Assistant Professor Wei Xu is using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to make text content more accessible to school children and people with disabilities. The research is part of a collaborative project with Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program. Of the $767,600 in total funding, Ohio State received $375,732. Low literacy is a dilemma facing U.S. school children and the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. \u201cAccording to the National Assessment of Educational Progress released by the U.S. Department of Education, more than 65% of eighth graders in American public schools are not proficient in reading and writing,\u201d explained Xu. To address this problem, her team is developing computer programs that can automatically scan a webpage or other types of documents, find complex words or grammatical structures, and replace them to make the text easier to understand. Prof. Wei Xu \u201cWe are training neural network models that are similar to what Google has used for machine translation,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of bilingual translation from, say, German to English, our models \u2018translate\u2019 complex English into simple English, using simple word alternatives and grammatical structures.\u201d In the user study conducted by collaborators at RIT, deaf and hard-of-hearing students also expressed that they could learn new words when they were provided synonyms of complex words and phrases on-demand. The potential impact of the work is far-reaching, even beyond the initial intended audiences. \u201cUltimately, our technology will allow people to read any content they want online at their own preferred readability levels,\u201d said Xu. \u201cEasy access to science articles, government policies and medical texts will benefit a broad population. It can allow children to develop interests in STEM at a young age, \u00a0and help people access useful resources regardless of their disability, education level or non-native language background.\u201d Xu\u2019s team is in the second year of the exploratory research and already have significantly improved the fluency and accuracy of their automatic system\u2019s generated texts. Currently they are enhancing the neural network designs and training procedure to further reduce errors and generate more fluent texts. \u201cWe also plan to collaborate with Matt Huenerfauth and Lisa Elliot at RIT, who are human-computer interaction and deaf education experts, to develop a web-based user interface for deaf and hard-of-hearing students\u201d said Xu. Ohio State\u2019s contributions to the project have already gained several accolades. Google researchers included the SARI (System Against References and Input) score Xu designed for evaluating text generation models\u2014including automatic text simplification\u2014in their official release of the Tensor2Tensor library, a collection of deep learning models that are particularly suited for neural machine translation and natural language generation. Additionally, Ohio State graduate student researchers\u00a0Mounica Maddela,\u00a0Chao Jiang\u00a0and\u00a0Yang Zhong\u00a0have lead-authored two papers related to the project that have been published and presented at top AI and natural language processing conferences. The team presented their findings at the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing in Brussels, Belgium and the 2020 Meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New York City. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications",

    "text_content": "Summer intern shines online during pandemic | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Summer intern shines online during pandemic Summer intern shines online during pandemic Posted: September 10, 2020 For many college students, an internship is a rite of passage\u2014providing valuable real-world experience and often serving as a steppingstone to full-time employment following graduation. Hannah Fouts But like so many milestones in 2020, spring and summer internships have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. According to Glassdoor , U.S. internship hiring has been cut in half this year due to COVID-19. Thankfully, Buckeye engineer Hannah Fouts\u2019s (2023) internship has carried on without missing a beat. The computer science and engineering major and Stamps Scholar shares with us what she\u2019s been working on and how she and her employer, Cyberthentic LLC, have adapted since COVID. College of Engineering: Your combined interest in computer science and law is unique. How did that develop? Hannah Fouts: My interest in computer science developed in middle school through my love of video games and robotics. Throughout high school, I was set on becoming a software developer. When I went to college, however, I stumbled upon the Mock Trial at Ohio State team, which gave me the opportunity to be a lawyer for a fictitious criminal. Through this I discovered my interest in being an attorney. I decided that I wanted to continue my pursuit of my engineering degree and use this along with a law degree to become a patent lawyer. CoE: How did you learn about the internship opportunity at Cyberthentic? Tell us about your role. HF: I learned about this opportunity through a family member who knew about the position and thought that I could fit the role. My internship at Cyberthentic started in March this year and is still going to this day. We are currently working to release a cybersecurity product focusing on email phishing attacks on businesses. I started off the internship learning how to develop explainer videos for a product, from script writing to animation. Currently I am developing the explainer video that will go on our website and will be used to market our product to IT managers. I have also acted as a consultant for pitch deck presentations. Finally, I am currently developing a patent as a part of our legal team. CoE: Many internships have had to change due to the pandemic. How did you and your employer adapt? How did the experience differ from your initial expectations? HF: Fortunately, since Cyberthentic is based in New Jersey, I had already been working remotely for my internship. This meant that we had quite a smooth transition once the pandemic hit in terms of technology. However, generally my employer had to be more flexible with meetings and deadlines as there were many external concerns and stressors on everyone as a result of the pandemic. CoE: What has been your biggest takeaway from the experience? HF: My biggest takeaway is how unprepared I was for the work force and how much I have learned in such a short amount of time. There are so many things that college has not taught me, such as learning how to conduct meetings, how to properly take meeting notes, how to build your personal brand, how to be wrong and appreciate constructive criticism, and how to teach yourself an entirely new concept quickly so that you complete work that others are relying on. CoE: How has it impacted your career goals? HF: While it has not changed my career plans, it has definitely given me a more clear sense of what is expected of me as a patent lawyer and how best to build my personal brand for law school and my future career. This internship has also given me confidence in being able to enter the workforce and interact with those with a lot more experience than me. CoE: Plans for the future? Or even just this upcoming year? HF: I plan to continue my internship as well as start a research thesis in the field of intellectual property law. I hope to eventually be able to get my thesis published in a law journal. CoE: Advice to other students who might be disappointed by virtual-only (WFH) opportunities? HF: While none of us expected to be in this situation, it is up to us to make the most out of it. My employer once told me that as much as we may not want to, we need to treat COVID-19 like it is the new normal. In doing that, not only will you be ahead of the game by participating in these opportunities, but you will also show employers how adaptable you are, even in a crisis. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu",

    "text_content": "A movement to equip front-liners with PPE | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News A movement to equip front-liners with PPE A movement to equip front-liners with PPE Posted: May 22, 2020 Julia Armstrong, a 2014 ECE alum shown with her daughter Alana, has led a key effort to outfit frontline workers with personal protective equipment. She Like many who are not in the medical field, Julia Armstrong didn\u2019t know the vital role of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers. Since stepping up to help with the COVID-19 outbreak, she has gained a clear understanding. For more than a month, Armstrong \u2014 who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Ohio State in 2014 \u2014 has led a significant effort to outfit frontline workers in Columbus with thousands of protective masks, face shields and other accessories. She serves on the leadership team for\u00a0Can\u2019t Stop Columbus, a movement dedicated to helping the community during COVID-19, and handles the large job of PPE coordination and delivery. Armstrong got involved in what became Can\u2019t Stop Columbus because the initial idea was to do a few virtual hackathons to address problems related to COVID-19. \u201cThe idea was, we could create quick, one-day software products to support our own,\u201d said\u00a0Armstrong, director of the\u00a0OHI/O\u00a0Informal Learning Program and HackOHI/O. \u201cBut within a matter of two conversations, we realized there were so many needs we could fill \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t going to be a one-day hackathon. It was going to be a movement.\u201d The movement is now about a 1,500-volunteer effort with 45 ongoing projects. She quickly took on two coordinating roles \u2014 data analytics and PPE \u2014 and recruited computer science students to help\u00a0toward Ohio State\u2019s computer modeling efforts\u00a0for the Ohio Department of Health. She led the PPE effort with support from colleagues and students throughout the university. Columbus-based 3D printing and materials company IC3D is donating more than 3,000 pieces of PPE as part of efforts being led by Ohio State So far, Armstrong\u2019s PPE team, in partnership with local businesses, is organizing the creation or procurement of personal protective equipment for a number of organizations in need. Among them: 1,890 N95 masks retrofitted for Wexner Medical Center 400 N95 masks and 1000 medical masks to Franklin County Emergency Management from Willow Works 1,000 medical masks to Central Ohio Transit Authority from Willow Works Individual volunteers 3D printing face shields with IC3D, totaling over 3,050 donated + over 200 ear relievers 1,000 face shields to Franklin County Emergency Management from Dynalab Inc., with a pledge of at least 11,000 more Pledge of 1200 injection molded face shields donated to Franklin County Emergency Management from What? Productions Pledge of 2,000 face shields from Makers4COVID \u201cOhio State has a wealth of information and specialists,\u201d she said. \u201cHarnessing that expertise to provide it to the community was incredibly important.\u201d Her team also launched a facemask public service announcement video and is investigating making medical gowns. Along with her PPE efforts, she works on other Can\u2019t Stop Columbus projects such as Can\u2019t Stop US, a toolkit to help other U.S. cities launch similar movements. And once the immediate crisis is over, she believes the movement will continue. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of rebuilding, and we\u2019ll be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do but people want to help. Honestly, it\u2019s been incredible to see.\u201d If you would like to volunteer for Can\u2019t Stop Columbus,\u00a0you can sign up at its website . The team\u2019s website also offers many\u00a0resources\u00a0for those in need due to the many challenges brought by COVID-19. from Together as Buckeyes",

An Ohio State University student organization is the winner of a grant that will fund efforts to improve diversity in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. The Association of Computing Machinery Women\u2019s Chapter (ACM-W) at Ohio State was one of the 2020 Ford College Community Challenge winning teams. Each year, Ford Motor Company Fund, the philanthropic arm of Ford Motor Company, invites students to develop and submit ideas for innovative projects that address community needs. This year seven proposals were selected to receive a $25,000 grant to implement their project. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated towards empowering women in computer science,\u201d said Sara Miskus, ACM-W student chapter president. \u201cWe do a lot of events that are centered around workshops, socials, professional development, company talks and basically just giving women the opportunity to network and gain opportunities in the technology field.\u201d As part of their winning proposal, members will work with local public schools and College Mentors for Kids to distribute computer science starter kits to upper-elementary and early middle-school-aged children. The kits will teach the basics of programming logic and give students the opportunity to channel their imagination into a coding project. ACM-W's 2018 Buck-I-Code, a free computer-science workshop for students ages 10-15, now called Code I/O \u201cOur proposal was to help children and underserved communities, as we wanted to focus on both education and diversity, especially due to the growing concerns of the pandemic\u2019s impact on academic equity,\u201d Miskus said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that underserved communities were getting those resources to explore STEM fields and make sure there is more diversity in engineering as a whole.\u201d The program also incorporates a one-on-one mentoring component for participating students. Due to COVID-19, this program will be conducted virtually for the foreseeable future. Miskus, a fourth-year in computer science and engineering (CSE), said mentoring in the STEM fields is critical. \u201cEngineering is a hard enough field. When you may be the only person in the room who is a woman or is a person of color, it\u2019s really important to have those allies to help and lift you up, support you and encourage your way through the technology field or engineering in general,\u201d she said. CSE major Milly Mason, community outreach coordinator for the ACM-W student chapter, agreed. \u201cACM-W\u00a0is a place where you can learn about computing, especially to empower women,\u201d she said.\u00a0\"One of my favorite things about it is knowing other people that are in the same position as me as a minority in STEM. I kind of like that we all go through the same struggles.\u201d In 2018, Buckeye Precious Plastic , a student organization in the College of Engineering won the Ford College Community Challenge. Their program worked to find ways to recycle plastic and to cut down on plastic pollution. In total, Ford Fund has distributed more than $3 million in global grants to support nearly 200 student-led social projects through the Ford College Community Challenge. by Chris Booker, Ohio State News",

Their startup company, Electrion, already has attracted investors to commercialize their energy storage as a service (ESaaS) innovation. The Electrion team (l to r): Anita Nti, Jacob Buaful, Jr., Caleb Buaful and Danny Freudiger The Electrion team\u2014engineering undergraduates Caleb Buaful, Jacob Buaful, Jr., and Anita Nti, and doctoral student Danny Freudiger\u2014noticed something while walking around Ohio State football tailgates in 2019: gas-powered generators everywhere. They started talking to Buckeye fans about how much energy they used for the TVs, slow cookers, mini fridges and satellite dishes powered by the generators before, during and after the games. Based on observations, campus data and scientific research, they estimated that tailgate parties using gas-powered generators emit over 120,000 pounds of carbon dioxide. That\u2019s the equivalent of over 3,200 sedans for the same amount of time. As members of the Ohio State student organization Smart Campus, founded by Freudiger, the team saw an opportunity for a project that aligned with the university\u2019s efforts to become carbon neutral by 2050. \u201cWe came back and started talking and thinking, \u2018If that\u2019s just from one day, that\u2019s thousands of pounds of CO2 being emitted at just one Ohio State game, how much more would be over a season and then at other schools across the nation as well?\u2019\u201d said Nti, Smart Campus president. \u201cWe saw that as a very significant impact, so we thought about how we could possibly be a solution.\u201d As an alternative to the generators, they are developing rechargeable battery packs, a sustainable mobile delivery service via electric cargo bikes, and a logistics platform to coordinate battery distribution and track status. \u201cFrom there we really thought about the user experience. Because you are providing this as an alternative, you want that transition to be smooth. If it\u2019s too hard, they\u2019ll just keep using the generator because it\u2019s easy to use,\u201d Caleb Buaful explained. So the students also created a cloud-connected mobile phone application to monitor the batteries and for people to request and interact with the service. \"It's been exciting to watch this talented team of students not only develop cutting-edge technology, but also navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship and business development,\u201d said BJ Yurkovich, a researcher at Ohio State\u2019s Center for Automotive Research (CAR) who is mentoring the students. An $89,000 Ohio State Sustainability Fund grant the team earned in January 2020 enabled them to launch a proof-of-concept project. The team subsequently connected with MegaJoule Ventures, an investment firm that shares their passion for sustainability. Their $250,000 investment provides support for the team to accelerate the formal market introduction of Electrion products, as well as the development of the engineering and design tools required to integrate a wide range of battery chemistries. Anita, Caleb and Jacob in the Electrion workshop at Ohio State's Center for Automotive Research \u201c MegaJoule Ventures is excited about the Electrion opportunity because of the great team in place both in terms of vision, but also the depth of knowledge they gained and the accelerated deployment schedule they maintained in releasing an advanced prototype,\u201d said company CTO Michael Gurin. \u201cTheir\u00a0fundamental understanding of the electrical energy storage market is also strategically aligned with our investment strategy.\u201d The student-entrepreneurs are currently building product prototypes in their workspace at CAR and brainstorming concepts to extend their \u201csustainable energy on demand\u201d model. \u201cI think everything we do should be about sustainability,\u201d Freudiger said. \u201cOne of the bigger reasons why we\u2019re here is to leave the world a better place than we found it so future generations can enjoy it and have it better off than we did.\u201d But what really gets them charged? Outreach to children in local school districts. \u201cHonestly, what separates people from each other and from opportunities, money or resources is just access to knowledge. That\u2019s really the key,\u201d said Jacob Buaful. \u201cOur idea is to go out there into classrooms and do the big general assembly talks informing people of what sustainability is and how they can help.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re starting them while they\u2019re young so they can start thinking about it and getting into it,\u201d Caleb Buaful said, an opportunity he and his brother didn\u2019t have when they were that age. Nti said the Electrion project sparked her interest in sustainability, and she is motivated by the knowledge gaps she observes to continue on in the field. \u201cPeople automatically think of sustainability on such a large scale and totally negate the fact that there\u2019s so much we can be doing on a smaller scale that can come together to actually make a large impact.\u201d modified version of original feature story by Joan Wall, Sustainability Institute",

This paper was presented and published in the 33 rd International Symposium on Microarchitecture in 2000 and co-authored with Zhao Zhang and Zhichun Zhu, who were then Ph.D. students at the College of William and Mary and are now Professors at University of Illinois at Chicago.\u00a0 According to the ACM SIGMICRO organization, \u201cThe Test of Time award is the highest honor an academic paper receives for its impact and\u00a0recognizes an influential MICRO paper whose influence is still felt 18-22 years after its initial publication.\u201d The three authors (from left to right): Xiaodong Zhang, Zhao Zhang, and Zhichun Zhu, had a brief celebration after receiving the acceptance notice of their Micro paper in Xiaodong\u2019s office at the College of William and Mary in September 2000. This paper demonstrates that conventional memory interleaving method would propagate address-mapping conflicts at cache level to the memory address space, causing DRAM row-buffer misses. This is a serious structural issue in DRAM design, significantly lengthening memory access latency. The permutation-based interleaving method in the paper solves the problem with a trivial microarchitecture cost. \u00a0Sun MicroSystems adopted the permutation method in 2001. Today, this patent-free method can be found in almost all commercial microprocessors, such as AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA, for embedded systems, laptops, desktops, and enterprise servers. The findings and the method are included in several Computer Architecture textbooks. The citation for this Test of Time Award reads \u201cThe method proposed in this seminal paper has had a significant impact in modern systems. For example, Sun Microsystems adopted the method, and many mainstream commercial processors use the method or variant of it\u201d. The Microarchitecture Test of Time Award is presented annually during the International Symposium on Microarchitecture, which is the flagship conference in the field of processor design and implementation. Since its first conference in 1968, only 21 Micro papers have been selected for this award. \u201cI feel highly honored to receive this award, and I am even happier for my former Ph.D. students to be recognized for their research 20 years ago,\u201d said Xiaodong Zhang. He has been an instructor of the undergraduate Computer Architecture class (CSE 3421) for several semesters. Xiaodong makes efforts to integrate research into his teaching. He said, \u201cI introduce the permutation method in this paper when I teach DRAM memory design in the class, aiming to inspire our students to do critical and innovative thinking.\u201d Xiaodong Zhang is Robert M. Critchfield Professor in Engineering.\u00a0 He \u00a0served as the CSE Department Chair for three terms (2006-2018).

The researchers are usually honored at the annual\u00a0Office of Research\u00a0and\u00a0Corporate Engagement Office\u00a0Research and Innovation Showcase in April, which was canceled this year due to COVID-19 protocols. Now a series of surprise meetings over CarmenZoom serves as the announcement. \u201cResearch and innovation are at the heart of what I want my presidency to be,\u201d said President Kristina M. Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s also at the heart of our land-grant mission and it\u2019s how we influence those we serve. The way to serve is by doing research in the betterment of society.\u201d The Early Career Innovator of the Year award for faculty and the Next Generation Innovator of the Year award, granted to students (undergraduate and graduate) or postdocs, were also announced. Arnab Nandi , associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, was named the Early Career Innovator of the Year. His work focuses on bridging human interaction and data infrastructure. He is also founder and CEO of Mobikit, a data infrastructure platform for the future of mobility. Nandi said the award, like his research, was built with the support of department leadership, university partnerships and graduate and undergraduate students. Alper Yilmaz , professor of geo-informatics in the Department of Civil Environmental and Geodetic Engineering, is the university\u2019s Innovator of the Year. Yilmaz was nominated because of his development of wireless geolocation technology. The patented technology is the basis of the startup firm Ubihere (pronounced you-be-here), providing a standalone solution to finding the position of an object or person. Yilmaz\u2019s cutting-edge research on map learning uses deep-learning methods similar to how humans learn to navigate an environment. Comprising two primary elements, an inertial measurement unit and an artificial intelligence processor, the wireless geolocation technology uses a map of the region and a multiple hypothesis approach to estimate a position of an object. His research has received over $11 million in funding from sources including NASA, the National Science Foundation and industry. \u201cIt\u2019s still an issue: How do we navigate without GPS and continue to advance the art of autonomous navigation? The work that you\u2019ve done in this space is just truly amazing,\u201d said Senior Vice President for Research Morley O. Stone. \u201cYour career is a model of innovation and your startup Ubihere is a tribute to your entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d said Scott Osborne, vice president for economic and corporate engagement. Yilmaz said he appreciated the support and leadership at Ohio State. The Zoom ceremony and award were unexpected. \u201cThis was a big surprise. I wasn\u2019t expecting it. It would not be possible without department support and the support of my graduate students,\u201d he said.",

She is among just 29 faculty across the U.S. to receive this honor and the first from Ohio State. Engineering Unleashed Fellows are faculty from higher education institutions who have been recognized for their contribution to engineering education, and specifically entrepreneurial engineering. They also were participants in the Engineering Unleashed Faculty Development Program , which highlights entrepreneurial minded learning as central to the development of engineering graduates prepared to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world. Armstrong, who serves as director of Ohio State\u2019s OHI/O Informal Learning Program\u2014which includes the annual hackathon\u2014was chosen for her project to infuse more self-directed learning into the formal engineering curriculum. To amplify the impact of her work, she will receive $10,000 through the Kern Family Foundation. \u201cThis project started by recognizing that KEEN values problem-based learning and industry connections, in addition to its 3Cs: curiosity, making connections, and creating value\u2014all things that matter to me and the OHI/O mission,\u201d said Armstrong. Working in tandem with faculty from the Departments of Engineering Education and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), she learned that ECE 2020\u2014a sophomore level electronic circuits course that is required for all ECE and computer science and engineering majors\u2014would be a good candidate for piloting a new delivery method. The modified course will help bridge entrepreneurial minded learning (EML) between first and fourth year curricular options, said Armstrong. \u201cThe First Year Engineering program at Ohio State is strong and well connected with KEEN, and the capstone program for fourth year around the college is becoming more connected to EML,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, there is a drought in second and third year programs. This would be a breakthrough and could provide a model for other courses and departments.\u201d \u201cThe timing with the pandemic is serendipitous, as informal learning happens on the students' schedule and within much of their interests as it's often self-directed,\u201d Armstrong explained. \u201cTake home kits and exploratory projects will have a place in the course, which works very well in our new distance and hybrid instruction models.\u201d And with both Armstrong\u2019s and ECE Professor Steve Bibyk\u2019s existing connections to industry and startup companies, there are a number of potential guest speakers\u2014many of whom are Buckeye engineers themselves\u2014who could offer real-world applications of class topics, she added. The pilot course will be taught to a section of computer science and engineering (CSE) students in spring 2021, but if successful, could eventually be open to all ECE 2020 students. \u201cI am so excited to take the value of OHI/O learning models into the classroom. I truly believe in the impacts of hands-on experience and self-directed learning, especially when paired with real-world application. We can move beyond an hour or a weekend event into longer term projects with additional layers of experience and understanding.\u201d As part of a previously funded KEEN project , Armstrong will also join Professor Gonul Kaletunc\u2019s cohort to help mentor engineering faculty on how to infuse EML into new or existing courses.

    "text_content": "Computer model makes strides in search for COVID-19 treatments | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Computer model makes strides in search for COVID-19 treatments Computer model makes strides in search for COVID-19 treatments Posted: February 1, 2021 A new deep-learning model that can predict how human genes and medicines will interact has identified at least 10 compounds that may hold promise as treatments for COVID-19. All but two of the drugs are still considered investigational and are being tested for effectiveness against hepatitis C, fungal disease, cancer and heart disease. The list also includes the approved drugs cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant that prevents transplant organ rejection, and anidulafungin, an antifungal agent. Ping Zhang The discovery was made by computer scientists, meaning much more work needs to be done before any of these medications would be confirmed as safe and effective treatments for people infected with SARS-CoV-2. But by using artificial intelligence to arrive at these options, the scientists have saved pharmaceutical and clinical researchers the time and money it would take to search for potential COVID-19 drugs on a piecemeal basis. \u201cWhen no one has any information on a new disease, this model shows how artificial intelligence can help solve the problem of how to consider a potential treatment,\u201d said senior author Ping Zhang , assistant professor of computer science and engineering and biomedical informatics at The Ohio State University. The researchers noted in the paper that a few of the repurposing candidates the model generated have already been studied for their potential use in COVID-19 patients. \u201cGreat minds think alike \u2013 some lead compounds identified by machine intelligence coincide with later discoveries by human intelligence,\u201d Zhang said. The research is published today (Feb. 1) in Nature Machine Intelligence . Zhang and colleagues had completed the model\u2019s design in May 2020, just as the first papers detailing how COVID-19 patients\u2019 genes responded to the virus were published. The new information provided an important test for the computer model, which the researchers call \u201cDeepCE\u201d \u2013 pronounced \u201cDeep Sea.\u201d To make predictions about how genes and medicines will interact and yield drug repurposing candidates, DeepCE relies on two primary sources of publicly available data: L1000 , a National Institutes of Health-funded repository of human cell-line data showing how gene expression changes in response to drugs, and DrugBank , which contains information on the chemical structures and other details on about 11,000 approved and investigational drugs. L1000 displays side-by-side cell-line comparisons of standard gene expression activity with gene expression changes produced by interactions with specific drugs. The cell lines represent diseases, such as melanoma, and organs, like kidneys and lungs. It is an ongoing project, with data being added as experiments in animals or humans supplement the gene expression profiles produced in cell-line experiments. The Ohio State researchers trained the DeepCE model by running all of the L1000 data through an algorithm against specific chemical compounds and their dosages. To fill in data gaps, the model converts chemical compound descriptions into figures, allowing for automatic consideration of their separate components\u2019 effects on genes. And for genes not represented in L1000, the team used a deep learning approach called an \u201cattention mechanism\u201d to increase the model\u2019s \u201clearned\u201d sample of gene-chemical compound interactions, which improves the framework\u2019s performance. \u201cThis way, the output demonstrates multitask learning \u2013 we can predict gene expression values for new chemicals not from one cell to one cell, but automatically predict the role of a drug on different cell lines and different genes,\u201d said Zhang, who leads the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Lab and is a core faculty member in the Translational Data Analytics Institute at Ohio State. \u201cWe can use the computer to simulate drug-induced gene expression. This provides real value. \u201cThe story should stop here \u2013 this is where we were during spring break. But then COVID-19 arrived, and we hoped our research could help, so we did a special case study for COVID-19 drug repurposing.\u201d The team applied DeepCE\u2019s gene expression prediction matrix \u2013 focusing on data from lung and airway cell lines and the entire DrugBank catalog of compounds \u2013 to the genetic information provided from the early COVID-19 papers and additional government data. The COVID-19 data demonstrated how human gene expression had responded to being infected with SARS-CoV-2, creating a \u201cdisease signature.\u201d \u201cBased on the known gene expression changes that have occurred and been identified with known drugs, we apply that to the gene expression in question \u2013 in this case, compounds that are being studied but are not yet experimented in L1000. We put such predicted \u2018drug signatures\u2019 against the COVID-19 patient profiles on a population level,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cOnce you can identify both signatures, the job is easy. Wherever we find the disease and a drug show opposite gene expression profiles, suggesting the drug would reverse the effects of the disease, you have found a drug that may treat the disease.\u201d This model complements a drug-repurposing model Zhang described in a recent paper that simulates clinical trials using observational clinical data . \u201cI want to put together a research agenda using all the different data resources for drug repurposing and drug-disease associations from multiple perspectives and connect with researchers who can collaborate with us to find new drugs for diseases \u2013 including unknown diseases,\u201d Zhang said.

QuSTEAM: Convergence Undergraduate Education in Quantum Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics , was awarded a $5 million cooperative agreement over a two-year period from the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator . Following QuSTEAM\u2019s initial assessment period, Phase I, the award will fund Phase II\u2019s objective to build transformative, modular quantum science degree and certification programs. \u201cI know from personal experience that collaboration is the key to scientific success. Working across disciplines \u2013 especially when it comes to the highly complex and multidisciplinary world of quantum science research \u2013 will help us more quickly harness the enormous power of this emerging field and deliver real-world results more quickly and efficiently,\u201d said Ohio State President Kristina M. Johnson. \u201cAs an added bonus, this project enables Ohio State to further part of its core mission, which is to educate the next generation of researchers through educational opportunities that advance diversity and workforce development.\u201d The rapidly evolving field of quantum information science will enable technological breakthroughs and have far-reaching economic and societal impacts \u2014 what researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology refer to as the second quantum revolution . Ohio State is emerging as a key leader in pushing the field forward, recently joining the Chicago Quantum Exchange , a growing intellectual hub for the research and development of quantum technology, as its first regional partner. \u201cNSF\u2019s Convergence Accelerator is focused on accelerating solutions toward societal impact. Within three years, funded teams are to deliver high-impact results, which is fast for product development,\u201d said Douglas Maughan, head of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program. \u201cDuring Phase II, QuSTEAM and nine other 2020 cohort teams will participate in an Idea-to-Market curriculum to assist them in developing their solution further and to create a sustainability plan to ensure the effort provides a positive impact beyond NSF funding.\u201d \u201cQuSTEAM is a great example of how universities and industry can work together to build the foundation for a strong, diverse workforce,\u201d said David Awschalom, the director of the Chicago Quantum Exchange and\u00a0Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering and Physics at the University of Chicago. \u201cInnovations in this field require us to provide broadly accessible quantum education, and QuSTEAM represents an ambitious approach to training in quantum engineering.\u201d Unlocking that potential, however, also requires a foundational shift in teaching and growing a quantum-literate workforce. QuSTEAM brings together scientists and educators from over 20 universities, national laboratories, community colleges, and historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to develop a research-based quantum education curriculum and prepare the next generation of quantum information scientists and engineers. The initiative also has over 14 industrial partners, including GE Research, Honda and JPMorgan Chase, and collaborates with leading national research centers to help provide a holistic portrait of future workforce needs. Ezekiel Johnston-Halperin \u201cWe have leaders in quantum information and STEM education, and both of these groups independently do good work building undergraduate curriculum, but they actually work together surprisingly rarely,\u201d said QuSTEAM lead investigator Ezekiel Johnston-Halperin, professor in the Department of Physics at Ohio State. \u201cWe are talking to people in industry and academia about what aspects of quantum information are most critical, what skills are needed, what workforce training looks like today and what they expect it to look like a couple years from now.\u201d \u201cWe feel strongly about the need for redesigning quantum science education, which is the objective of QuSTEAM,\u201d said Marco Pistoia, head of the Future Lab for Applied Research and Engineering (FLARE) at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cThe complexity of the quantum computing stack is enabling the creation of many new job opportunities. It is crucial for quantum curricula nationwide to collectively support this multiplicity of needs, but for this to happen, quantum scientists and engineers must have the proper training. We are very excited to see the impact of QuSTEAM\u2019s work in the near and long term, considering finance is predicted to be the first industry sector to start realizing significant value from quantum computing.\u201d QuSTEAM is headed by five Midwestern universities: lead institution Ohio State, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, all of which have partnered with local community colleges and regional partners with established transfer pipelines to engage underrepresented student populations. The group is also collaborating with the IBM-HBCU Quantum Center to recruit faculty from its network of over 20 partner colleges and universities, as well as Argonne National Laboratory. In all, the QuSTEAM team comprises 66 faculty who share expertise in quantum information science and engineering, creative arts and social sciences, and education research. To best develop a quantum-ready workforce, QuSTEAM identified the establishment of a common template for an undergraduate minor and associate certificate programs as the near-term priority. The team will build curricula consisting of in-person, online and hybrid courses for these degree and certification programs \u2014 including initial offerings of the critical classes and modules at the respective universities while continuing to assess evolving workforce needs. QuSTEAM plans to begin offering classes in spring 2022, with a full slate of core classes for a minor during the 2022-2023 academic year. The modular QuSTEAM curriculum will provide educational opportunities for two- and four-year institutions, minority-serving institutions and industry, while confronting and dismantling longstanding biases in STEM education. \u201cIf we want to increase diversity in quantum science, we need to really engage meaningfully with community colleges, minority-serving institutions and other small colleges and universities,\u201d Johnston-Halperin said. \u201cThe traditional STEM model builds a program at an elite, R1 university and then allows the content to diffuse out from there. But historically this means designing it for a specific subset of students, and everything else is going to be a retrofit. That\u2019s just never as effective.\u201d QuSTEAM leverages integrated university support from faculty and staff from the Drake Institute for Teaching and Learning, the Institute for Materials Research, the Department of Physics and the Ohio State Office of Research. Johnston-Halperin is joined at Ohio State by QuSTEAM co-PI Andrew Heckler, professor of physics and physics education research specialist. Other Ohio State faculty included on QuSTEAM are Daniel Gauthier, professor in the Department of Physics; Christopher Porter, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics; David Penneys, associate professor in the Department of Mathematics; Zahra Atiq, assistant professor of practice of computer science and engineering in the College of Engineering; David Delaine and Emily Dringenberg, assistant professors of engineering education in the College of Engineering; and Edward Fletcher, associate professor of educational studies in the College of Education and Human Ecology. QuSTEAM is one of 10 teams selected for two-year, $5 million Phase II funding as part the NSF Convergence Accelerator 2020 Cohort, which supports efforts to fast-track transitions from basic research and discovery into practice, and seeks to address national-scale societal challenges. With this funding, QuSTEAM will address the challenge of developing a strong national quantum workforce by instituting high-quality, engaging courses and educational tracks that allow for students of all backgrounds and interests to choose multiple paths of scholarship.",

Dr. Crawfis teaches a Procedural Content Generation for Games Course, a Senior Capstone Project class, and a Junior Project Interactive Systems Class. His areas of research include Scientific Visualization, Computer Graphics, Procedural Content Generation, and Image-based Rendering. He also led the creation of the game \"Recovery Rapids\" alongside a team of students, rehab researchers, and brain injury survivors. The game \"Recovery Rapids\" serves to assist survivors who have suffered from brain trauma, stroke, or other injuries in which the Motor Cortex of the brain is impaired. Damage to the Motor Cortex can result in difficulty moving certain parts of the body. These patients require constraint-induced movement therapy to regain voluntary movement of the specified sites. Unfortunately, insurance companies do not typically cover the CI therapy for more than a certain number of hours while patients need the therapy every day to heal properly. First notified of this issue by a rehab neuroscience specialist, Dr. Crawfis and his team approached the obstacle of building an affordable imitation of CI therapy through the game \"Recovery Rapids\". Through two years of development, Recovery Rapids was built to rehabilitate patients with sufficient Motor Cortex damage. Dr. Crawfis and his team mapped game mechanics to functional movement in order to recreate the gold standard CI therapy techniques. The game challenges the user's brain in moving the disabled sites which are usually located on the upper half of the body, specifically the arm and shoulders. These activities are targeted at \"retraining the brain\" contrary to physical therapy that specifically focuses on muscle toning. In addition to providing CI therapy, Recovery Rapids was designed to be a fun gaming experience. The game uses Microsoft Kinect and models real-life activities such as rowing a kayak and picking up objects. It includes 30 hours of unique Gameplay, so each day is not monotonous for the user. The game was also designed with suggestions from patients, so it centers largely on user preferences. The game was built through Microsoft XNA using C# and runs on a standard Windows platform. In order to provide university students with a chance to learn about software principles in gaming, Dr. Crawfis assisted in developing the Junior Project Class, CSE 3902. Students in the course use Microsoft XNA and C# in order to recreate a 2D platform game. Dr. Crawfis has demonstrated that the application of interactive systems and design patterns can have a worthwhile impact.

    "text_content": "Some mobile phone apps may contain hidden behaviors that users never see | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Some mobile phone apps may contain hidden behaviors that users never see Some mobile phone apps may contain hidden behaviors that users never see Posted: April 1, 2020 A team of cybersecurity researchers has discovered that a large number of cell phone applications contain hardcoded secrets allowing others to access private data or block content provided by users. The study\u2019s findings: that the apps on mobile phones might have hidden or harmful behaviors about which end users know little to nothing, said\u00a0Zhiqiang Lin, an associate professor of\u00a0computer science and engineering\u00a0at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. The study has been accepted for publication by the 2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May. The conference has moved online because of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Typically, mobile apps engage with users by processing and responding to user input, Lin said. For instance, users often need to type certain words or sentences, or click buttons and slide screens. Those inputs prompt an app to perform different actions. For this study, the research team evaluated 150,000 apps. They selected the top 100,000 based on the number of downloads from the Google Play store, the top 20,000 from an alternative market, and 30,000 from pre-installed apps on Android smartphones. They found that 12,706 of those apps, about 8.5 percent, contained something the research team labeled \u201cbackdoor secrets\u201d \u2013 hidden behaviors within the app that accept certain types of content to trigger behaviors unknown to regular users. They also found that some apps have built-in \u201cmaster passwords,\u201d which allow anyone with that password to access the app and any private data contained within it. And some apps, they found, had secret access keys that could trigger hidden options, including bypassing payment. \u201cBoth users and developers are all at risk if a bad guy has obtained these \u2018backdoor secrets,\u2019\u201d Lin said. In fact, he said, motivated attackers could reverse engineer the mobile apps to discover them. Qingchuan Zhao, a graduate research assistant at Ohio State and lead author of this study, said that developers often wrongly assume reverse engineering of their apps is not a legitimate threat. \u201cA key reason why mobile apps contain these \u2018backdoor secrets\u2019 is because developers misplaced the trust,\u201d Zhao said. To truly secure their apps, he said, developers need to perform security-relevant user-input validations and push their secrets on the backend servers. The team also found another 4,028 apps \u2013 about 2.7 percent \u2013 that blocked content containing specific keywords subject to censorship, cyber bullying or discrimination. That apps might limit certain types of content was not surprising \u2013 but the way that they did it was: validated locally instead of remotely, Lin said. \u201cOn many platforms, user-generated content may be moderated or filtered before it is published,\u201d he said, noting that several social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, already limit the content users are permitted to publish on those platforms. \u201cUnfortunately, there might exist problems \u2013 for example, users know that certain words are forbidden from a platform\u2019s policy, but they are unaware of examples of words that are considered as banned words and could result in content being blocked without users\u2019 knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, end users may wish to clarify vague platform content policies by seeing examples of banned words.\u201d In addition, he said, researchers studying censorship may wish to understand what terms are considered sensitive. The team developed an open source tool, named InputScope, to help developers understand weaknesses in their apps and to demonstrate that the reverse engineering process can be fully automated. Other authors on this work include Chaoshun Zuo at Ohio State, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt at New York University, and Giancarlo Pellegrino at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security.",

Such applications will depend on the development of future intelligent communication edge network that go beyond 6G systems and can interconnect billions of end devices that provide services and solutions for the benefit of all. This is the vision of the new $20M NSF AI Institute for Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence (AI-EDGE) led by Ohio State and partially funded by U.S. Department of Homeland Security. AI-EDGE will create new AI tools and techniques to ensure that communications networks are self-healing and self-optimized. These networks will also be designed to help solve long-standing distributed AI challenges \u2013 making AI more efficient, interactive, privacy-aware, and secure. AI-EDGE is led by Dr. Ness Shroff , Ohio Eminent Scholar and Chaired Professor of ECE and CSE Departments, of The Ohio State University. \u00a0It includes 30 prominent researchers, scientists, and engineers from 11 universities, 4 leading companies in networking and Artificial Intelligence, and three of our premier Department of Defense Research Labs. The team is focused on edge networks \u2014 a trend in the technology world with the rapid increases in processing power at edge devices \u2014 most of the growth is expected to come with wireless devices, services, and applications at the edge rather than the traditional network core. These edge networks will encompass mobile and stationary end devices, wireless and wired access, and computing and data servers. \u201cAI technologies will bring revolutions to distributed edge networks,\u201d Shroff said, \u201cThe next generation edge networks will have distributed and intelligent agents to enable intelligent transportation, remote healthcare, distributed robotics, smart aerospace, etc.\u201d \u201cNetworking and AI are two of the most transformative IT technologies, which help to better our everyday lives, and are critical to national economic competitiveness, national security, and defense. The Institute will exploit the synergies between the two,\u201d said Shroff, \u201cso that AI will empower Networking and benefit from Networking .\u201d The overall research plan of the Institute will span over two broad synergistic themes: AI for Networks and Networks for AI. One theme is to apply AI to design the next generation edge networks that are highly efficient, reliable, robust, and secure. \u201cWe will develop a new distributed intelligence plane to ensure that these networks are self-healing, adaptive, and self-optimized.\u201d said Shroff. While the preliminary successes of\u00a0AI for networks\u00a0have\u00a0been promising,\u00a0developing AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms to networking with minimal or no human oversight poses many challenging research questions to be explored systematically and in depth. To this end, the team will innovate their research along four research directions: re-engineering the physical fabric for 6G and beyond wireless networks through AI, designing AI-enabled network resource allocation, developing multi-agent AI-based distributed network control, and devising new AI powered network security techniques. On the other hand, \u201cthe future of AI is distributed because AI will increasingly be implemented across a diverse set of edge devices.\u201d said Shroff, \u201cThus, the developed intelligent and adaptive networks will in turn solve long-standing distributed AI challenges, making AI more efficient, interactive, and privacy preserving.\u201d \u201cA critical role that the Institute will play is to shorten the interactions between Foundations and use case research across multiple disciplines,\u201d said Shroff, \u201cwhich will dramatically accelerate the time it takes from doing the foundational research to seeing the products in the field. \u00a0Thus, the team will explore three wireless edge use cases in depth, which include ubiquitous sensing and networking, human machine mobility, and programmable and virtualized 6G and beyond networks. \u201cThese use cases will significantly connect the key research thrusts and their validation to specific experimental platforms,\u201d said Shroff. The Institute will work with the industry and DoD partners to facilitate translation and adoption. It is a national priority to educate students, professionals, and practitioners in AI and networks, and substantially grow and diversify the workforce. Thus, the Institute will develop novel, efficient, and modular ways of creating and delivering education content and curricula at scale, and to spearhead a program that helps build a large diverse workforce in AI and networks spanning K-12 to university students and faculty. \"AI is, without a doubt, the future, offering the opportunity to improve personalized health care, augment cybersecurity, boost smart mobility, enhance food security, and so much more; but its vast possibilities cannot be fully realized without advancements that substantially improve cutting-edge technologies and bring new services to a broader audience,\" said Ohio State President and ECE Professor Kristina M. Johnson . \"Not only will they continue the ongoing and incredibly vital work to fully realize the potential of AI, but they will also offer the opportunity to increase the number and diversity of individuals with the skills necessary to meet the long-term workforce needs of this important field.\" AI-EDGE is anticipated to create a research, education, knowledge transfer, and workforce development environment that will facilitate future co-revolutions of next-generation edge networks and AI technologies for many decades to come. double-arrow Faculty Profile Shroff, Ness Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communication, Electrical and Computer Engineering Ohio Eminent Scholar, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 247-6554 shroff.11@osu.edu",

The tower is part of a study using artificial intelligence to understand different aspects of urban environments. When Craig Fouts met Tanya Berger-Wolf this past spring, he was introduced to ways of seeing and using artificial intelligence (AI) that have fascinated him. Berger-Wolf, director of Ohio State\u2019s Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) , not only began advising Fouts on his honors research project on AI, but this summer she hired him as a research assistant to work on a national study that has multiple long-term implications. The study \u2014 which is using a 30-foot tower at the Ohio State Airport for environmental research using AI methodology \u2014 is a Battelle-funded project that will serve as a pilot for multiple National Science Foundation AI efforts Ohio State researchers are leading. In the process, these studies are allowing undergraduate, graduate and PhD students exceptional and rare opportunities. \u201cWorking in (Berger-Wolf\u2019s) lab is really cool. I love it,\u201d said Fouts, a senior double majoring in math and computer science . \u201cI don\u2019t want to just focus on code or machine learning; I\u2019m really interested in ecological influences and taking inspiration from biology. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve found fascinating about working in her lab. \u201cThe experience is totally different from working in a class. It\u2019s great because you get the experience of applying things you\u2019ve learned in a classroom and the experience of approaching problems you haven\u2019t been taught how to solve.\u201d Fouts and other students in Berger-Wolf\u2019s lab are experimenting with machine learning algorithms to understand different aspects of urban environments. The data they use is collected from sensors on the 30-foot mobile tower at the airport. Those sensors are collecting such things as CO 2 emissions, noise and pollution from the combustion engines in the airplanes taking off and landing at the airport. \u201cAI helps us put so many little puzzle pieces from different sources with different domains together into one big picture to answer big questions,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. Ohio State students will work with a tower that's deployed as part of a study using artificial intelligence to understand different aspects of urban environments. Along with TDAI, faculty and students from Ohio State\u2019s Sustainability Institute , the College of Engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences are conducting studies as part of the project. For example, one of the sensors on the tower is from a project led by Huyen Le , an assistant professor of geography and core faculty of the Sustainability Institute, which is studying health impacts of traffic-related pollution. Dema Alkashkish, a sophomore biomedical engineering major, is a research assistant on that project. Her job includes everything from deploying sensors that pull in data on air pollutants, like one she installed at the airport tower, to coding algorithms for the sensors to outreach to schools and organizations to install the sensors. \u201cA project like this exposes you to so many majors and disciplines; it\u2019s been really cool to see how people from different backgrounds work together to solve problems,\u201d Alkashkish said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned skills that will help me through every aspect of my life through this process.\u201d Bringing together various disciplines to attack big problems is a theme at Ohio State, and AI is quickly becoming a critical tool to get there. The tower project is a pilot study for two major NSF projects led by Ohio State investigators and TDAI affiliates that will begin in October and November. Both projects focus on building and improving AI infrastructures, making technology better, faster and more accessible. And because many Ohio State faculty members are involved in the projects, students at all levels are being recruited and hired to help in the research. \u201cIf I was a student coming to Ohio State right now, I\u2019d be super excited,\u201d said Ness Shroff , the principal investigator for the AI Edge project. \u201cNot only do you have an opportunity to be part of these institutes and work with professors who are very good at what they do, but you have an opportunity to work across different universities. In all of our programs, we are going to have opportunities for students to travel to other universities as well as take on internships with companies involved in the project.\u201d Along with those two institutes, Berger-Wolf will lead another major NSF endeavor . \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that this is all happening at Ohio State,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the environment and expertise here. The strength of Ohio State is that you don\u2019t have to ask whether \u2018that\u2019s a biology question\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s a computer science question.\u2019 No, it\u2019s a question we humans are asking, and we have the people across the spectrum of necessary expertise who are willing and able to find the answers to those questions. \u201cWe\u2019re way past the ivory tower model of research in universities. This is the translational part of the questions we can ask to truly impact our world.\u201d double-arrow Featured Faculty Berger-Wolf, Tanya Academic Director, Academic Affairs Administration Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Evolution Ecology and Organismal Biology Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track berger-wolf.1@osu.edu",

Today, the U.S. National Science Foundation announced the establishment of 11 new NSF National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes, building on the first round of seven institutes funded in 2020. The combined investment of $220 million expands the reach of these institutes to include a total of 37 states. The AI Institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment ( ICICLE ) and AI Institute for Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence ( AI-EDGE ), both led by Ohio State teams, will each receive a total of $20 million over five years. Each institute will manage about $10 million in funding with the rest shared by core partner institutions across the United States. \u201cAI\u00a0is, without a doubt, the future, offering the opportunity to improve personalized health care, augment cybersecurity, boost smart mobility, enhance food security, and so much more; but its vast possibilities cannot be fully realized without advancements that substantially improve cutting-edge technologies and bring new services to a broader audience,\u201d said Ohio State President Kristina M. Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s why these two NSF-recognized institutes at Ohio State are so important. Not only will they continue the ongoing and incredibly vital work to fully realize the potential of AI, but they will also offer the opportunity to increase the number and diversity of individuals with the skills necessary to meet the long-term workforce needs of this important field.\u201d Led by NSF, and in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture, the National AI Research Institutes will act as connections in a broader nationwide network to pursue transformational advances in a range of economic sectors and science and engineering fields \u2014 from food system security to next-generation edge networks. Dhabaleswar K. Panda, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State, is the principal investigator for ICICLE, leading a core team of 46 academic researchers and staff scientists from 13 organizations. The institute will build the next generation of cyberinfrastructure with a goal of making AI data and infrastructure more accessible to the larger society. \u201cArtificial intelligence is becoming very important. A lot of people are using it, but it is still limited to only advanced technical people. How do we take it to the masses?\u201d Panda said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we want to take AI \u2014 a plug-and-play version which will be democratized so that anybody can use it over the years.\u201d Ness Shroff, professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science and engineering, is the principal investigator for AI-EDGE, leading a core team of 30 scientists from 11 collaborating institutions, three Department of Defense research labs and four global companies. The institute will focus on AI innovation for wireless devices, services and applications at the network edge rather than the traditional network core. These edge networks will encompass mobile and stationary devices, wireless and wired access, and computing and data servers. \u201cThese technologies, AI and networking, are critical for a number of things that we do. They are critical for economic health, they are critical for technological development, and they are critical for national defense and national safety,\u201d Shroff said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that the U.S. regain its competitive edge in these technologies, and part of the work of these AI institutes is to help make that happen.\u201d The Ohio State ICICLE team will work in collaboration with the Ohio Supercomputer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Iowa State University, Indiana University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Texas-Austin/Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Utah, University of Delaware, University of California, San Diego/San Diego Supercomputer Center, University of California, Davis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and IC-FOODS. AI-EDGE will collaborate with Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, Purdue University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Michigan, University of Texas-Austin, University of Washington, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign and University of Illinois-Chicago. It will also work with its industrial partners including AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm and the Air Force Research Lab, Army Research Lab and Naval Research Lab to translate the research so that it is widely adopted.

Or a governor can dial up exactly how to enhance food security prior to a hurricane. It would take seamless access to a highly technical artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, but Ohio State\u2019s Dhabaleswar K. (DK) Panda is working to get us there. \u201cIf you look at AI, it\u2019s become very important but it is limited to only advanced technical people,\u201d said Panda, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. \u201cHow do we take it to the masses? We want to create a plug-and-play AI that will be democratized it so anybody can use it.\u201d Panda is leading a National Science Foundation institute to do exactly that. The institute is called ICICLE (The AI Institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment) and features a team of 46 academic researchers and staff scientists from 13 organizations, including many from Ohio State, all working to build a cyberinfrastructure to make AI accessible to society. While this project is in the early stages, Panda has a track record of developing computational tools for communities at large. He is a rock star (no, seriously) in the high performance computing world, having developed supercomputing software libraries that are being used by more than 3,000 organizations in 89 countries. \u201cTraditionally our work has been targeted to purely scientific computing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now with AI coming, it requires similar kinds of answers. My research team and I have been exploring this new direction \u2014 how to combine HPC with AI with big data \u2014 and that has led to a lot of foundational developments.\u201d One of ICICLE\u2019s team members is Tanya Berger-Wolf , director of Ohio State\u2019s Translational Data Analytics Institute . She said Panda and Ohio State are the perfect leaders for this project. \u201cDK Panda represents a unique powerhouse at Ohio State,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. \u201cHe is the world\u2019s leader in high performance computing (HPC) and particularly developing this intelligent adaptive HPC. I can think of few people, if any, in the world who could have put together a team like (ICICLE). \u201cOhio State is the one place you can do a project like this. We have the right people across the spectrum of necessary expertise, and they\u2019re willing and able to answer big questions.\u201d ICICLE will initially build and prove its AI cyberinfrastructure in three domains: smart foodsheds, digital agriculture and animal ecology. Long-term, this same cyberinfrastructure could be adapted to many arenas. In health care, for instance, it could mean faster medicinal development or quicker diagnosis of diseases, such as cancer. In the process of building this AI infrastructure, Panda said there will be a strong focus on workforce development, training the next generation for the jobs of tomorrow. \u201cThis is very important,\u201d Panda said. \u201cIf you think of this vision, to allow people anywhere to use AI, there\u2019s a lot of work needed to build the software and design these systems.

The Ohio State University has been awarded a $15 million grant from the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of a new, interdisciplinary institute and establish a new field of study that has the potential to transform biomedical, agricultural and basic biological sciences. The new entity, which will be called the Imageomics Institute, is an inaugural institute for data-intensive discovery in science and engineering created by the NSF as part of its Harnessing the Data Revolution initiative. As such, the Imageomics Institute will be part of forming a national collaborative research network dedicated to computation-enabled discovery. Led by faculty from Ohio State\u2019s Translational Data Analytics Institute , the Imageomics Institute will create a new field of study in which scientists use images of living organisms as the basis for understanding biological processes of life on Earth. This new approach, called imageomics, will utilize machine learning methodologies to extract from images biological traits such as the behavior or physical appearance of an individual, or even the distinguishing skeletal structure of a species. Imageomics will leverage and extend the paradigm of knowledge-guided machine learning by structuring the algorithmic underpinnings around biological knowledge and continually guiding and refining them using new biological knowledge as it is generated. Similar to genomics before it, which applied computation to the study of the human genome, imageomics will leverage computer science to help scientists extract meaning from an otherwise unwieldy amount of natural image data. Images to be studied include digital collections from museums, labs and other institutions, as well as photos taken by scientists in the field, camera traps, drones and even members of the public who have uploaded their images to platforms such as eBird, iNaturalist and Wildbook. The ability to use image data for scientific discovery will get scientists closer to answering compelling questions such as:\u00a0Are\u00a0a baby zebra\u2019s stripes similar to its mother\u2019s, and what might the genetic mechanism be for inheriting the pattern? How do the skulls of bat species vary with environmental conditions, and what evolutionary adaptation drives that change? What subtle morphological features distinguish closely related species of fish from each other and why? Berger-Wolf \u201cSo many pictures of organisms exist with scientific value that we\u2019ve been unable to analyze at the right scale,\u201d said Tanya Berger-Wolf, faculty director of the Translational Data Analytics Institute and principal investigator for the Imageomics Institute. \u201cThis will change how we are able to see and understand the natural world. Computers help humans \u2018see\u2019 images differently and expose what we may otherwise miss.\u201d In addition to Berger-Wolf, a professor of computer science and engineering (CSE), electrical and computer engineering, and ecology, evolution and organismal biology at Ohio State, the project team includes: CSE Assistant Professors\u00a0Yu Su and Wei-Lun Chao;\u00a0biologist and computer scientist co-investigators from Tulane University, Virginia Tech, Duke University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; senior personnel from Ohio State, Virginia Tech and six additional institutions; and collaborators from more than 30 universities and organizations around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be part of this team of scientists venturing into a new space between their respective disciplines, toward something completely different,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. \u201cIt is everything that is great about interdisciplinary collaboration.\u201d by Jennifer Grabmeier, Translational Data Analytics Institute double-arrow Featured Faculty Berger-Wolf, Tanya Academic Director, Academic Affairs Administration Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Evolution Ecology and Organismal Biology Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track berger-wolf.1@osu.edu Chao, Wei-Lun Distinguished Assistant Professor of Engineering Inclusive Excellence, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track chao.209@osu.edu Su, Yu Distinguished Assistant Professor of Engineering Inclusive Excellence, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track su.809@osu.edu",

    "text_content": "Rethinking High-Performance Persistent Transactions | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Rethinking High-Performance Persistent Transactions Rethinking High-Performance Persistent Transactions Posted: February 14, 2022 Persistent memory is an exciting new technology that bridges the gap between two well-established technologies: main memory, which is fast to access but loses its contents in the event of power loss or hardware failure, and disk, which is slow to access but retains its contents if the power goes off or the hardware fails. To help programmers write correct programs using persistent memory, programming languages provide a construct called persistent transactions, which help ensure that persistent memory can recover to an understandable state after a power or hardware failure. However, existing algorithms for persistent transactions slow programs significantly because they rely on techniques called crash-consistency mechanisms that are inefficient. Associate Professor Mike Bond has been awarded an NSF grant for the project Rethinking High-Performance Persistent Transactions and totals $499, 998. Using the award, Prof. Bond and his research students will develop two novel crash-consistency mechanisms that overcome the limitations of prior crash-consistency mechanisms. They will apply these new mechanisms to develop new persistent transaction algorithms, and evaluate these algorithms empirically in comparison to prior persistent transaction algorithms, on real-world persistent memory programs and platforms. A key insight of the new crash-consistency mechanisms lies in the novel way they leverage technology called hardware transactional memory that is included in Intel processors. The work aims to contribute efficient crash-consistency mechanisms and persistent transaction algorithms that are more efficient than prior approaches, while influencing future research in this rapidly developing area. The funded work aims to improve the performance of a key construct for achieving reliable persistent memory programs. This improvement can help make persistent memory widely practical, by achieving both main memory's performance and the disk's retention of contents in the event of failure. Practical persistent memory will improve programmer productivity and make computing systems faster and more reliable. These benefits in turn will impact society across domains that rely on computing, including science, engineering, transportation, and medicine. To increase impact, the implementations resulting from the project will be made publicly available in addition to published research papers. Prof. Bond's research students will be trained in the funded work's topics and methodologies, preparing them for the workforce. Undergraduate and graduate courses taught by Prof. Bond will incorporate the project's research topics. Workshops organized by Prof. Bond and other CSE faculty will expose undergraduate students, especially students who are members of underrepresented groups, to computing research and grad school. These activities will help to educate a diverse workforce of computer scientists trained in the project's topics and research. double-arrow Faculty Profile Bond, Michael Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track bond.213@osu.edu",

In addition, decisions made both during and long after a crisis affect the trust between responsible decision-makers and affected citizens. iStock photo A multidisciplinary team of researchers at The Ohio State University received a $750,000 grant from the National Science Foundation\u2019s Convergence Accelerator to help combat those issues by providing decision-makers with organized access to credible information, especially during public health crises. Led by Computer Science and Engineering Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy, the project team will develop prototype artificial-intelligence-driven tools that bring timely, high-quality integrated content to bear on decision making and governance, from routine operations to crises such as a pandemic or natural disaster. Personalized to meet the needs of various users\u2014such as government officials, first responders, and educational and institutional decision-makers\u2014the tools will curate and present information from various sources, including news outlets, social media, scientific publications and government documents. \u201cA lot of the information that's out there could be misinformation, so we\u2019d like to provide tools that can not only explain the authenticity of the information, but where it comes from,\u201d Parthasarathy explained. \u201cAlso, we only want to show information that's relevant to whatever the user is interested in looking at that particular moment. We want to personalize the content curation to the specific decision-maker.\u201d The team will study these issues through the context of two extreme types of crises\u2014a pandemic, which occurs over a longer timeline and is considered an information-rich scenario, versus a natural disaster such as a hurricane, which happens more quickly and is considered information-poor, at least initially. Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy \u201cOur goal is to study this and determine, what is the role of misinformation in these somewhat distinct types of public health crises?\u201d Parthasarathy explained. \u201cIn information rich-environments, misinformation has more nuanced, more sophisticated ways of showing up. We need to be able to solve for these sort of two extreme use cases.\u201d If successful, the tools could enable officials to quickly identify where to prioritize relief efforts or activities such as risk communication or correcting inaccurate information. They could also aid officials in understanding the impact of decisions, especially on underrepresented or disadvantaged populations, and help fight misinformation by explaining why a particular statement is inaccurate. \u201cWe're at a point right now where trust in governance is at an all-time low in the United States,\u201d Parthasarathy said. \u201cA tool like this can facilitate improved trust between the folks governing and the citizens.\u201d Researchers will engage with and build stakeholder communities through partnerships with government and industry to guide tool development, and validate the tools using simulated crisis scenarios that also serve as a training opportunity for decision-makers. The research team represents a convergence of disciplines, spanning expertise in computer science, social sciences, linguistics, network science, public health, cognitive science, operations and communications. Ohio State project co-investigators include Assistant Professor Yu Su (Computer Science and Engineering), Assistant Professor Huan Sun (Computer Science and Engineering), Professor R. Kelly Garrett (Communications), Assistant Professor Ayaz Hyder (Environmental Health Sciences);\u00a0and Associate Professor David Melamed (Sociology). Wright State University Professor Valerie Shalin (Psychology), University of South Carolina Professors Shannon Bowen (Journalism and Mass Communications) and Professor Amit Sheth (Computer Science and Engineering), and Air Force Research Laboratory Senior Cognitive Scientist Christopher Meyers are also collaborators. Sheth is an engineering alumnus who earned his master\u2019s (\u201983) and PhD (\u201985) in computer and information science from Ohio State. The project builds on previous National Science Foundation (NSF) grant-funded work led by Parthasarathy to investigate new ways for emergency responders to efficiently gather and analyze data in the wake of\u00a0disasters. Launched in 2019, the NSF\u2019s Convergence Accelerator builds upon research and discovery to accelerate use-inspired convergence research into practical application. Ohio State\u2019s Actionable Sensemaking Tools for Curating and Authenticating Information in the Presence of Misinformation During Crises project was selected in the first phase of the NSF Convergence Accelerator's 2021 cohort and is one of 12 teams funded under the accelerator's Trust and Authenticity in Communications Systems track. by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu double-arrow Faculty Profile Parthasarathy, Srinivasan Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Biomedical Informatics Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 292-2568 parthasarathy.2@osu.edu",

This paper was co-authored with Xiang Deng (currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. Sun), and collaborators from Google Research, Dr. Alyssa Lees, Dr. You Wu and Dr. Cong Yu. Another paper of hers titled with \u201cCliniQG4QA: Generating Diverse Questions for Domain Adaptation of Clinical Question Answering\u201d won the Best Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) 2021. This paper was co-authored with Xiang Yue (currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Sun), Xinliang Frederick Zhang (then an undergraduate in CSE and now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan), Ziyu Yao (then a Ph.D. student in CSE and now an assistant professor at George Mason University), Simon Lin (then the Chief Research Information Officer at the Nationwide Children's Hospital and now at the University of California, Riverside). Here is a brief introduction of the two papers: 1. TURL [VLDB\u201921] addresses an important problem of understanding semi-structured tabular data with representations learned via neural models. Tabular data is in abundance on the Web and databases. Owing to the wealth and utility of these data, there has been growing interest in a variety of tasks in the area of table understanding. Users often query over tables from multiple sources to find the information they need, and compose their own tables to organize the information. However, existing work generally relies on heavily-engineered task-specific features and model architecture, which not only require huge manual efforts to design, but also hard to generalize well across tasks. In this paper, the authors introduce the pre-training/fine-tuning paradigm to relational tables, which is inspired by the success of large pre-trained language models for natural language processing. TURL first learns deep contextualized representations on relational tables by self-supervised pre-training, the pre-trained representations can then be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning. This study makes a great example of how to extend representation techniques designed for unstructured text to structured data such as tables. The SIGMOD Research Highlight Award is a highly selective and prestigious award for\u00a0 the database community to showcase a set of research projects that exemplify core database research. In particular, each of these projects addresses an important problem, represents a definitive milestone in solving the problem, and has the potential of significant impact. This award also aims to make the selected works widely known in the database community, to our industry partners, and to the broader ACM community. The ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD) is concerned with the principles, techniques and applications of database management systems and data management technology. Its members include software developers, academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, users, and students. SIGMOD sponsors the annual SIGMOD/PODS conference, one of the most important and selective in the field.\u201d 2. CliniQG4QA addresses an important problem of domain adaptation of natural language question answering (QA) models. Medical professionals often query over clinical notes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to find information that can support their decision-making. One way to facilitate such clinical information-seeking activities is to train a clinical question answering (CliniQA) system, which inputs a clinical document (e.g., a patient record) as well as a natural question raised by a clinician and extracts a text span from the document as the answer to the question. However, a QA model trained on one dataset often struggles to generalize to new questions and new contexts.\u00a0 In the paper, the authors propose a simple yet effective framework, CliniQG4QA, which leverages automatic question generation to synthesize QA pairs on new clinical contexts and boosts QA models without requiring manual annotations. This study makes a great example of how to adapt general natural language processing (NLP) techniques to specialized domains such as clinical informatics. The IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) has established itself as the premier research conference in bioinformatics and biomedicine. IEEE BIBM 2021 provides a leading forum for disseminating the latest research in bioinformatics and health informatics. It brings together academic and industrial scientists from computer science, biology, chemistry, medicine, mathematics and statistics \u201cWe are very excited to receive these awards and it is a great recognition of my students\u2019 hard work and the team collaboration,\u201d said Huan Sun. She has been dedicated to developing natural language interfaces and conversational AI systems with applications to various domains, which requires interdisciplinary effort. She said, \u201cTURL is one of our attempts to bridge the gap between the natural language processing and database community. The techniques introduced in CliniQG4QA could be applied to bootstrap conversational AI interfaces for other domains beyond clinical question answering. \u201d double-arrow Faculty Profile Sun, Huan College of Engineering Innovation Scholar, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track sun.397@osu.edu",

CSE is very delighted to announce that the OSU TacoBot team led by Prof. Huan Sun won third place in the first Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. The team consists of six students from Prof. Sun\u2019s research group, two from Prof. Yu Su \u2019s and one from Prof. Mike White \u2019s. According to Amazon Science and Prof. Sun, the TaskBot Challenge was launched in March 2021 and selected ten university teams to develop bots that assist customers with multi-step cooking or do-it-yourself (DIY) home improvement tasks. Success requires the teams to address many difficult artificial intelligence (AI) challenges, from knowledge representation and inference, and commonsense and causal reasoning, to language understanding and generation. Only five teams advanced to the finals and OSU TacoBot is the only US team among the top-3 performers. The team will receive a $50,000 prize for the honor. \u201cOur developed bot was deployed in the Alexa virtual assistant to interact with real customers and receive feedback from them, \u201dsaid Prof. Sun. She has been dedicated to developing natural language interfaces and conversational AI systems in various domains. \u201cIt is a very meaningful process with real impact and we learnt a lot from this challenge.\u201d \u201cWe are excited about the possibility that future TaskBots can closely collaborate with users to address their needs and questions via knowledgeable, contextualized, and engaging multi-modal interactions,\u201d said Shijie Chen , one student lead. \u201cWe believe that TaskBots can potentially make technologies more accessible. Instead of browsing through many web pages, users can have a multi-modal conversation with TaskBots to find instructions for their ongoing tasks and answers to their questions. With the upcoming SimBot challenge , it\u2019d be even more exciting if the TaskBot could be embodied in a moving robot that executes complex tasks in the environment for users.\u201d Ron Chen , the other student lead. \u201cThe development of Conversational AI technologies is at a tipping point. On the one hand, there is growing consensus on the potential of conversational AI as the next-generation universal human-machine interface. On the other hand, the current technologies are still very limited in their coverage, contextualizability, and adaptivity. The fast feedback loop with real users provided by the Alexa Prize challenges is an important driver for developing next-generation conversational AI technologies.\u201d Said Prof. Su, faculty co-advisor for the TacoBot team and faculty advisor for the SalsaBot team in the upcoming SimBot challenge. (Yes, TacoBot and SalsaBot will be two sister bots from OSU!)

Csuri is remembered as a true renaissance man whose lifetime of achievement epitomized the American Dream. A graduate and professor of art education and computer and information science at The Ohio State University for over 40 years, Csuri formed the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD) and co-founded the Ohio Supercomputer Center and Cranston/Csuri Productions, one of the first computer animation companies in the world. Dubbed the \u201cfather of computer art\u201d by Smithsonian , Csuri led the development of code to enable artists to produce art in new ways on computers. His early work in computer plotter drawings, computer animation and 3D imagery secured his spot as a pioneer in combining art with technology. \u201cProfessor Csuri was a pillar in the Ohio State community and truly epitomized the Greatest Generation,\u201d said President Kristina M. Johnson. \u201cFrom his time as a football captain and national champion to his groundbreaking work as a professor, he exemplified the Buckeye spirit of innovation and excellence. I admired him greatly. He led an incredibly full life, and his prolific accomplishments have been, and will continue to be, a source of endless inspiration for inventors, artists and leaders around the world.\u201d The results of Csuri\u2019s groundbreaking work have been applied to flight simulators, computer-aided design, visualization of scientific phenomena, magnetic resonance imaging, education for the deaf, architecture and special effects for television and films. Csuri\u2019s works are on display in the Museum of Modern Art , the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Zagreb Museum of Contemporary Art and are included in the personal collections of noted artists Roy Lichtenstein and George Segal. In 2000, Csuri received the Ohio Governor's Award for the Arts and Ohio State's Joseph Sullivant Medal in acknowledgment of his lifetime achievements in the fields of digital art and computer animation. In 2011, he received the Award for Lifetime Achievement in Digital Art by ACM SIGGRAPH, the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2014, he received the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award from the Ohio State College of Arts and Sciences. Csuri was a captain on the 1943 football team \u201cThe College of Arts and Sciences joins in celebrating the remarkable life of Chuck Csuri,\u201d said David Horn, the interim executive dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. \u201cHis pioneering research established ACCAD as a national leader in integrating art, design and technology, and made career-defining experiences possible for generations of faculty and students. The communities in which he worked will miss his creative spark.\u201d Csuri was born on July 4, 1922, in West Virginia to Hungarian immigrant parents. He attended Ohio State, where he was a three-year letterman for the Buckeye football program and played on the school\u2019s first national championship team in 1942. Coached by the legendary Paul Brown \u2014 who called him \u201cthe perfect tackle\u201d \u2014 Csuri led the 1942 Buckeyes to a 9-1 record, a Big Ten Conference championship and a No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. For his efforts, Csuri was named an All-American and the team\u2019s Most Valuable Player. A team captain on the 1943 team, Csuri was selected in the 1944 NFL Draft by the Chicago Cardinals, but he declined in order to serve his country in World War II. Csuri served in the U.S. Army from 1943-46, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and receiving a Bronze Star for heroism. His time in the Army later inspired one of his early digital artistic works, \u201cRandom War\u201d (1967), which commented on the randomness of loss and death during military actions. Despite his deep devotion to serving his country, Csuri later in life spoke to the power of peace, unity and worldview. During his service, Csuri earned a certificate in engineering from the Newark College of Engineering in 1945. Following his Army service, he returned to Ohio State to obtain his master\u2019s degree in fine arts. In the late 1960s, Csuri used a grant from the National Science Foundation to form the Computer Graphics Research Group (CGRG) at Ohio State, which pioneered computer-based art and animation. Csuri\u2019s daughter, Caroline, remembers him saying that the grant \u201csent shockwaves through the university. People thought I was crazy as an artist to be working with computers.\u201d Csuri\u2019s excitement was in realizing his vision by collaborating with students and faculty from multiple disciplines, and his work helped make Columbus the birthplace of computer animation \u2014 even catching the attention of famous animator Chuck Jones, who came to dinner at the Csuris\u2019 house to see what they were doing, Caroline said. A Csuri digital creation In 1987, Csuri founded the CGRG\u2019s successor, the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design, which provided the latest computer animation resources in teaching, research and production. ACCAD alumni have gone on to work in some of the top companies in the industry, including Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Industrial Light and Magic. \u201cProfessor Csuri was a visionary. His work placed Ohio State at the center of the development of the field of computer graphics. He created unimaginable opportunities and experiences in the field for his students,\u201d said Maria Palazzi, professor of design and director of ACCAD. \u201cMost impressively, Chuck conceived of and created a\u00a0truly\u00a0collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to making computer graphics, centering the artist alongside the scientist. This is the community he built for his students at CGRG and later at ACCAD, and that they have taken out into the world.\u201d Csuri\u2019s vision of aligning art with technology, each informing the other, remains a model for the kind of transdisciplinary work that is at the heart of the arts at Ohio State. From the work created at ACCAD to the collaborative projects done at the Wexner Center for the Arts between residency recipients and Ohio State faculty in areas like astronomy and engineering, Csuri\u2019s legacy lives on. His life was filled with\u00a0achievement\u00a0that canvassed athletics, the military, academics and art. But the remarks of curators of global museums, professional colleagues and his students over the course of 80 years marked his generosity, humor, curiosity and humanity as a remarkable husband, father, teacher and friend. He met and married his wife, artist Lee Csuri, in the 1950s. They were married for 70 years and had two children, Steven and Caroline. Csuri is preceded in death by Steven (2018) and Lee (2019) but leaves behind Caroline and granddaughters Hannah and Emily Reagh. Condolences can be sent through the Charles Csuri website and on Instagram . Donations and gifts are requested to be directed to the Special Olympics , one of Csuri\u2019s favorite charities.",

The CAREER award is the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) most prestigious award in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of both. Zhang\u2019s project is funded by the NSF program, Information Integration and Informatics. His project, \u201cDeveloping Actionable Methods for Observational Health Data\u201d will integrate deep learning algorithms and causal inference techniques to advance precision medicine. Observational health data such as electronic health records and health insurance claims contain large amounts of clinical information about diverse patients and their responses to treatments in real-world settings. \u201cMany existing machine learning methods focus on making predictions on observational data, such as the chance of death or risk of heart attack, instead of providing actionable suggestions to physicians,\u201d explained Zhang. \u201cThis project will help physicians propose the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.\u201d Researchers will develop an AI system to identify optimal treatment regimens for critically ill patients to improve their chances of survival. Based on the patient\u2019s health status, the AI system will suggest if and when to initiate and adjust treatment such as antibiotics, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and surgical procedures to physicians, and each choice affects the patient's survival at the end of the hospital stay. From a computer science perspective, combining causal inference with deep learning for modeling observational health data\u2014which involves complex, confounding factors that can conceal true causal relationships and even lead to fake associations\u2014will make theoretical contributions to machine learning and data mining, said Zhang. \u201cWe will make all materials, such as source code, documentations and scientific findings available for public access,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom an application perspective, the project will develop a series of AI tools for clinical decision support.\u201d \u201cWe will also closely collaborate with medical researchers and physicians for model validation on various clinical problems, and will actively seek technology transfer opportunities,\u201d said Zhang, noting that his team will work with the Department of Emergency Medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center for sepsis treatment planning, and with the Center for Pediatric Trauma Research at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital for pediatric trauma care. Because the project is interdisciplinary, it is ideal for teaching machine learning for healthcare applications, and will provide graduate and undergraduate students with new programs, courses, research, and internship opportunities. Zhang is co-developing a new master\u2019s program, \u201cAI in Digital Health,\u201d a joint effort of the Computer Science and Engineering and Biomedical Informatics departments. The program will prepare students with a core curriculum in machine learning (ML) and AI, and enhance this core by its applications to digital health. Students will be able to interact with ML/AI technologies to create novel innovations in biomedical, clinical, and healthcare research. This project will also actively include underrepresented students and outreach to local high schools and the general public. Zhang holds joint appointments in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Informatics in the College of Medicine. He also leads the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIMed) Lab at Ohio State and is a core faculty member in the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). Prior to joining Ohio State in 2019, he was a research staff member and master inventor at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. His research has contributed to multiple AI products, including Watson for Drug Discovery, and Watson for Patient Safety. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu Tag: CAREER double-arrow Faculty Profile Zhang, Ping Associate Professor, Biomedical Informatics Associate Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track zhang.10631@osu.edu",

President Kristina M. Johnson joined Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Workforce Transformation (OWT), to open the first\u00a0meeting of the Ohio Broadband & 5G Sector Partnership . The partnership is part of a larger effort by OWT and BroadbandOhio to grow the workforce needed to expand broadband access and 5G in Ohio. \u201cWe know right now, that post-COVID, employers and people everywhere are expecting flexibility to work from home, work from anywhere,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have that linkage, whether it\u2019s in our rural communities or in our urban communities, we\u2019re missing out on talent and jobs are going to go to the best talent and the best-educated workforce.\u201d Husted announced a new round of broadband and 5G-focused Individualized Microcredential Assistance Program (IMAP) funding. This is the third round of the initiative, which helps those who are low income, partially unemployed or totally unemployed participate in a training program and receive a technology-focused credential at no cost. Eligible credentials focus on fiber optics, telecommunications tower technicians, 5G readiness and other skills. Institutions that currently offer these credentials are eligible to apply, as well as institutions that intend to launch a relevant program within six months from July 1st. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure everybody in Ohio can participate in the modern economy, education and health care system by having access to high-speed internet and the latest technologies,\u201d Husted said. \u201cThat will enable them to do the great kinds of things that are happening here at The Ohio State University and in our education and private sector institutions around the state.\u201d In January, Husted announced Ohio State was awarded $3 million to design curriculum for the partnership in an effort to develop a skilled broadband workforce. Once developed, the curriculum will be available to all higher education institutions in Ohio to implement. The initiative\u2019s principal investigator is Professor Anish Arora, chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Co-PIs are Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Eylem Ekici and Computer Science and Engineering Professor of Practice Rajiv Ramnath. Prof. Arora outlines the partnership's workforce development goals. \u201cAs 5G deployment takes root in Ohio, Ohio State\u2019s strategic priority for leading efforts in next generation communications enables an excellent alignment with the state\u2019s goals for workforce development in this space,\u201d Arora said. \u201cThrough the efforts of our newly launched 5G-OH Connectivity Center, we will develop and disseminate an innovative curriculum in coordination with the sector partners.\u201d The partnership continues to work to address skills gaps in Ohio\u2019s labor market, inclusively engage its currently underserved and unserved populations, and help Ohio become a national leader in broadband expansion and 5G deployment. The primary outcome of the education, training and awareness programs will be a workforce prepared for sector-wide employment and advancement. With faster data speeds, increased device density and ultralow latency, 5G is expected to transform how people and machines communicate and how industries do business, and enable \u201csmart\u201d and connected communities. According to research from Boston Consulting Group, 5G deployment will contribute $1.4 trillion to $1.7 trillion to U.S. GDP and create 3.8 million to 4.6 million jobs in the next decade. double-arrow Faculty Profile Arora, Anish Distinguished Professor of Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering Chair, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 292-1836 arora.9@osu.edu Ramnath, Rajiv Professional Practice Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Clinical Faculty (614) 292-9358 ramnath.6@osu.edu",

The idea of empowering memory and data storage devices with an embedded and dedicated computing facility has been around for more Zhang in his Dreese Labs office than 20 years with many published papers. However, Zhang and his team observed that storage industries could hardly gain benefits from the available academic research results for three reasons. First, the available designs in research projects assumed that external bandwidth between compute nodes would always be lower than that of internal bandwidth inside a compute node, which has been proven to be incorrect. Second, the cost and power constraints were largely not considered in the academic research projects. Finally, the interface between the designed computational storage systems and existing computing systems was customized, which hindered it becoming a part of general-purpose computing ecosystems. The team\u2019s funded project, \u201cA New Direction of Research and Development to Fulfill the Promise of Computational Storage,\u201d will address these critical issues of computational storage and aim to develop the new system to be a dependable part of computing infrastructure in both software and hardware. The other two PIs are Louisiana State University Associate Professor Feng Chen and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Professor Tong Zhang. The three PIs have a long-term collaboration track record on storage research with impact. For example, their advanced error correction code (ECC) implementation has been widely adopted in commercial solid-state devices (SSDs) in both customer-grades and enterprise-grades by major companies, such as Intel and Samsung. Their storage buffer management and hybrid storage designs have been adopted in the products of Apple and Oracle. \u201cI am glad that the panel ranked our proposal to be highly competitive,\" said Zhang. \"Moving computing power to storage systems is also new research to me. I am confident that our research will influence industries on the development of next generation storage systems.\u201d To systematically integrate computational storage into existing computing ecosystems, the research team will design a service-oriented abstraction for applications, optimize system-level resource utilization, and leverage proximity and mitigate memory resource contention in device hardware, among other tactics. Zhang and his colleagues also aim to make a broader impact by training students at different levels with research activities, enriching curriculum and classroom teaching with new research results, and contributing to outreach activities. Zhang has consistently opened his lab to undergraduate students to do research, many of whom went to top CSE graduate programs at Ohio State and other universities including University of Illinois, University of Southern California, and New York University. double-arrow Faculty Profile Zhang, Xiaodong Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Robert M.

The CAREER award is the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) most prestigious recognition of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of both. Bassily\u2019s project, \u201cExtending the Foundations of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning\u201d is funded by NSF\u2019s Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace program. Training machine learning models on personal data can be beneficial in many settings, but it can also lead to the undesirable disclosure of sensitive information. The performance of existing privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms is far from satisfactory, according to Bassily, especially in modern applications, such as protecting the confidentiality and privacy of customer or patient data. \u201cThis deficit is mainly due to the severe limitation in our current understanding of the fundamental characteristics of these algorithms,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe lack of solid and comprehensive theoretical foundations means a lack of optimal design principles for building algorithms with superior and provable performance guarantees. This presents a real challenge hindering the leap of privacy-preserving machine learning to the practical domains and hampering its real-world impact.\u201d To address this challenge, Bassily\u2019s CAREER project aims to fully understand the computational and statistical limits of privacy-preserving machine learning and optimization algorithms. He will then build a comprehensive theory that would enable the development of new privacy-preserving algorithms that can be implemented for widespread practical use. At this early stage of the project, the research is focused on constructing new privacy-preserving algorithms for convex and non-convex optimization, which will form the basis for developing practical algorithms for modern applications of machine learning with strong performance guarantees. Bassily\u2019s next goal is to establish the fundamental statistical and computational limits of privacy-preserving optimization and develop a rigorous algorithmic framework for privacy-preserving distributed and federated learning. His research is centered around a rigorous mathematical framework for data privacy known as differential privacy, a mathematical criterion that allows one to reason about privacy in a formal and quantifiable fashion. \u201cAlgorithms that are designed to satisfy this criterion, as those developed in this project, provide a strong and provable privacy guarantee to their input datasets,\u201d said Bassily. \u201cThe performance of such algorithms exhibits an inherent tradeoff between privacy and utility.\u201d The central challenge is to develop algorithms that offer the optimal tradeoff between the two\u2014in other words, offer the best utility under the same level of privacy protection, he added. Developing optimal differentially private algorithms often requires devising new design and analysis tools. The educational component of Bassily\u2019s project includes launching new graduate courses on optimization and differential privacy. He also plans to develop interdisciplinary workshops to understand the current threats to data privacy and discuss the role of privacy-preserving machine learning in dealing with those threats. Bassily joined The Ohio State University in 2017 as an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is also a core faculty member at the Translational Data Analytics Institute. Previously, he was a data-science postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego, and a postdoc at The Pennsylvania State University. He earned his PhD in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. by Meggie Biss, College of Engineering Communications | biss.11@osu.edu double-arrow Faculty Profile Bassily, Raef Associate Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 292-0248 bassily.1@osu.edu double-arrow Related News April 18, 2022 Zhang\u2019s NSF CAREER Award will advance AI for healthcare More News",

    "text_content": "Google/Apple\u2019s contact-tracing apps susceptible to digital attacks | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Google/Apple\u2019s contact-tracing apps susceptible to digital attacks Google/Apple\u2019s contact-tracing apps susceptible to digital attacks Posted: July 28, 2022 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists and health authorities have relied on contact-tracing technologies to help manage the spread of the virus. Yet there\u2019s a major flaw in a framework that many of these mobile apps utilize \u2013 one that attackers could exploit to ramp up false positive notifications. Apps powered by the Google/Apple Exposure Notification framework (GAEN) are widely available in many countries and operate more efficiently in your phone\u2019s background. But researchers from The Ohio State University said they found that these apps are susceptible to geographically based replay attacks, which is when a third party captures a user\u2019s broadcasted contact-tracing phone data from one area and exploits it by repeatedly transmitting it in another far-away location. Replay attacks can be used to exploit electronic weaknesses to gain access to digital networks, cause harmful effects to mobile devices, or poison data sets with false information. Considering how much society relies on honest health data, bad information can be especially harmful in terms of tracking COVID-19, said study co-author Anish Arora, professor and chairperson of computer science and engineering at Ohio State. Anish Arora \u201cHackers or nation-state actors could potentially take advantage of an honest user and replay their contact-tracing data anywhere in the world,\u201d Arora said. For example, if someone in Columbus with COVID-19 were to have their contact-tracing beacon data captured by a third party, their information could be transmitted to one or multiple other cities thousands of miles away, and re-broadcasted to others nearby. If this person were to be diagnosed positive for COVID-19, someone who in reality hasn\u2019t had any contact with an infected person could be alerted that they have. That means attackers could essentially create digital superspreaders, starting a process that shares clusters of false exposure beacons in different areas, said Arora. \u201cBecause the framework operates as a wireless protocol, anybody can inject some kind of fake exposure, and those false encounters could disrupt the public\u2019s trust for the system,\u201d he said. Although an increase in false-positive notifications would undermine the public good behind contact-tracing apps, co-author Zhiqiang Lin , professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State, said it could also have cascading economic and social consequences, like causing people to miss work or cancel daily personal activities and long-planned vacations. This potential rises when tests are scarce or in economically disadvantaged countries that don\u2019t have access to vaccines, added Lin, who has studied cybersecurity vulnerabilities in digital software for over a decade. Yet researchers were able to come up with a patch for this fatal flaw. \u201cThe most difficult part was coming up with a fix that was practical and wouldn\u2019t inhibit users from using the app,\u201d Lin said. The team came up with a prototype based on Google and Apple\u2019s original framework, which they called GAEN+, pronounced \u201cGain Plus.\u201d After implementing it on an Android device (The prototype is also easily portable to Apple devices), they ran the prototype through a series of experiments to test its defenses against malicious replay attacks. They concluded that compared to Google and Apple\u2019s framework, GAEN+ was able to effectively prevent false positives while still preserving user privacy. The team presented their solution on July 12 at the annual meeting of Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) conference held this year in Sydney, Australia. Zhiqiang Lin Lin said while the team may not be the first to find Google and Apple\u2019s flaw, they are currently the first team to prove to the larger digital community how it could be taken advantage of in a \u201clow-cost, distributed manner.\u201d \u201cThey may have just thought this couldn\u2019t be of severe consequence,\u201d he said. But overall, Lin describes their modification to the contact-tracing protocol as \u201cvery minimal\u201d for such a strong defense against potential attacks. \u201cOur enhancement is privacy-preserving,\u201d Arora said. Instead of relying on precise GPS data like other proposed fixes, GAEN+ uses coarse location data from Wi-Fi access points and cell phone towers in a clever way that maintains anonymity, he said. The team did receive thanks from Google for finding and fixing the weakness. To ensure GAEN+ is available to the public, the team has put the source code for the fix on GitHub, a platform that hosts code online. \u201cWhen future developers design similar protocols, we\u2019re making sure they have the opportunity to consider our recommendations,\u201d Arora said. \u201cBoth companies made a product that can do a lot of good in the world. We just want to make GAEN much harder to exploit.\u201d Other co-authors were Christopher Ellis and Haohuang Wen, both graduate students in computer science and engineering at Ohio State.

So leaders of both are teaming up to offer students a chance to envision the future of the iconic structure affectionally known as the \u2018Shoe. Overlooking the Olentangy River, Ohio Stadium turned 100 this year . It has hosted thousands of events\u2014athletic contests, commencement ceremonies and concerts\u2014and created millions of memories for Buckeye fans and families. The 10th installment of HackOHI/O, a 24-hour marathon of coding, collaboration and creativity, will be held on October 8-9 in the Ohio Union. This summer, OHI/O Program Director Cal King and Department of Athletics and Business Advancement Chief Marketing Officer Tracy Hedrick met up to discuss ways the two seemingly disparate anniversaries could connect. They landed on creating a special challenge available for the 800-some student hackathon participants to choose. Each year HackOHI/O features special challenges provided by corporate sponsors for student teams to tackle and compete for prizes. For example, last year Root Insurance asked hackathon participants for their most innovative solution to making our roads safer. AEP\u2019s challenge involved ways to use drones to help inspect hundreds of thousands of power line miles. The special Ohio Stadium 100 challenge will ask HackOHI/O students to envision the future of tech in and around the \u2018Shoe. \u201cWe would love for students at the hackathon to imagine how they could use technology to improve or transform the stadium visitor experience,\u201d said Hedrick. \u201cThe challenge is intentionally broad so that their creativity and passion as Buckeye fans can shine.\u201d Hack OHI/O 2018 King said that full challenge details will be revealed at the event on October 8. \u201cWe think this is an excellent way to merge Ohio State\u2019s excellence in experiential learning with its passion for athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for students to show the \u2018Shoe what they can do.\u201d HackOHI/O also is launching a partnership with the Keenan Center for Entrepreneurship. Any team that completes HackOHI/O will be invited to participate in the Best of Student Startups (BOSS) program. The first place winner at HackOHI/O will receive an automatic invitation to pitch at the BOSS finale and to participate in Boost Camp, a six-week preparatory program for the President's Buckeye Accelerator .

Prof. Hari Subramoni, Asst. Prof. Martin Kong (Moreno), Asst. Prof. of Practice Jaimie Kelley and Assoc. Prof. Donald Williamson What is home? To some a home is a place you live, whether it is a house, apartment, or condo. To others it is the space in which you feel the most comfortable, a place to build memories as well as a place to return to. For 15 new faculty to the CSE department their professional home is The Ohio State University. Within this new cohort of faculty 4 alumni - Jaimie Kelly, PhD \u201917, Assistant Professor of Practice; Martin Kong (Moreno), PhD \u201915, Assistant Professor; Hari Subramoni, PhD \u201913, Assistant Professor; and Donald Williamson, PhD \u201916, Associate Professor - are returning HOME to CSE teach a new generation of computer scientists. Jaimie Kelley Dr. Jaimie Kelley spent the last five years teaching at liberal arts universities in Ohio. Teaching the next generation has always been her ongoing purpose. \"I enjoyed teaching students in small class sizes, but kept thinking about my ability to effectively support so many more students than those in my classes. Accepting this Assistant Professor of Practice position in the Computer Science and Engineering department at OSU felt like coming home. Here, I hope to be able to positively impact more students and more effectively support diversity in Computer Science,\" stated Jaimie. Martin Kong (Moreno) \u201cThere are many reasons for coming back to The Ohio State University. OSU has given me a lot. First, my graduate experience here was great. I had wonderful advisors and labmates here. In particular, CSE was exceptionally strong in high-performance computing, and I felt there was a tradition to which I could contribute. Then, I heard of all the growing and changes that were taking place in the department, on campus, University wide, in the city, and it just felt right,\u201d said Martin. Before coming back to CSE, Dr. Moreno was an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma. Donald Williamson Dr. Williamson moved to the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University after graduation where he was able to establish his research group and further evolve his projects and interests. Donald returns to CSE@OSU because it\u2019s a \u201ca special place that is ideal for developing the next generation of computer scientist and engineers. Students are exposed to a wealth of interdisciplinary knowledge that is beneficial for them now as students and when they address different problems during later stages of their career. I definitely want to be a part of this process and contribute in any way that I can. Furthermore, the future prospects of CSE@OSU are extremely bright, and I wanted to be a part of that.\u201d The CSE Department is excited to Welcome Home our Alumni along with the other 11 new faculty joining our already distinguished faculty!

This paper was first-authored by Yu Gu (currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Su). Here is a brief introduction of the ArcaneQA paper: ArcaneQA uses a novel unified framework to address two fundamental challenges in knowledge base question answering (KBQA), namely, large search space and schema linking. Modern knowledge bases (KBs) like Freebase or Google Knowledge Graph contain millions of entities and billions of facts about these entities (as edges in the graph). Finding answers to a natural language question from such massive KBs can induce an extremely large search space. In addition, the broad semantic space defined by the schema of the KB leads to pervasive ambiguities. For example, for the question \u201c Flaminia Brasini was the designer of what game?\u201d does it refer to the designer of games (denoted as games.game.designer ) or golf courses (denoted as sports.golf_course.designer ). While it is easy for humans to disambiguate between the two because we understand the semantics of the entire question, it is non-trivial for AI models, especially when there are many more of such similar schema items competing with each other. Existing methods tackle KBQA with a pipelined design, which are limited in both scalability and accuracy (due to error propagation). In this paper, Yu Gu and Prof. Su propose a unified model that addresses both the aforementioned challenges with two mutually-boosting techniques, i.e., a dynamic program induction module and a dynamic contextualized encoding module. The former can effectively prune the search space on the fly, while the latter further intelligently guides the search process for the right answer by jointly encoding the question and the KB schema using pre-trained language models like BERT. ArcaneQA achieves a high accuracy on multiple standard KBQA benchmarks and is faster than existing methods by an order of magnitude.\u00a0It can be used to answer questions for domains it has never seen before, i.e., zero-shot generalization, which is a key capability for such systems to be used in practice. COLING, the International Conference on Computational Linguistics, is one of the premier conferences for the natural language processing and computational linguistics. COLING 2022 provides a leading forum for disseminating the latest research in computational linguistics and natural language processing. The Outstanding Paper Award of COLING 2022 is highly selective. Only 15 papers out of 2253 submissions have won this award.

The funding is part of Intel\u2019s academic program that will create a community of developers to explore programming applications for quantum computing. Universities will develop quantum course curricula to proliferate the use of the Intel\u00ae Quantum Software Developer Kit (SDK), a full-stack software development kit optimized for executing hybrid algorithms. In addition to Ohio State, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, Deggendorf Institute of Technology and Keio University also received grants. Led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Ron Reano, the Ohio State faculty working group includes Computer Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Syedah Zahra Atiq, Physics Professor Mohit Randeria, and Physics Professor Nandini Trivedi. To enable broad dissemination, they will partner with the National Science Foundation-funded QuSTEAM Initiative , a multi-institution effort led by Ohio State to develop a diverse and effective workforce by creating more equitable pathways to quantum science education. The faculty also will partner with qBraid, a cloud-based platform for learning about quantum information and programming on quantum computers. Quantum computing promises to dramatically speed up complex problem-solving and has the potential to enable significant breakthroughs in materials, chemicals and drug design, financial and climate modeling, and cryptography. Advances in quantum bits, or qubits, are one step toward achieving quantum practicality, but significant breakthroughs are needed across the full hardware and software stack to realize its full potential. The Ohio State team will leverage the Intel Quantum SDK to enable its students to program quantum computing algorithms with a high-performance Intel Quantum Simulator qubit target backend. According to Reano, the curriculum will focus on quantum computing concepts targeting undergraduate and graduate students from physics, computer science, computational science and electrical and computer engineering. It will be piloted during the 2023 spring semester. After piloting initial course modules, the working group will partner with relevant departments to insert the modules into other courses offered to students. Beyond the period of this award, the piloted modules will be incorporated into the QuSTEAM network and distributed to more than 25 colleges and universities within two to three years and up to 300 by 2027. \u201cThe modules will be injected into classrooms with both undergraduate and graduate students who will participate in coursework covering a variety of topics, from integrated optics and photonics to quantum mechanics,\u201d said Reano. \u00a0\u201cWe see this work with the Intel Quantum SDK as an important step in creating a community of developers who can program quantum computers as we strive to bring this nascent technology to its full potential.\u201d Earlier this year, Ohio State announced its Center for Quantum Information Science and Engineering (CQISE), which is creating synergy among the university\u2019s current activity and pushing the entire field forward. Center co-directors are Reano and Ezekiel Johnston-Halperin, professor in the College of Arts and Sciences Department of Physics. \u201cWe will bring together key examples from all the modules and present them at a student-event hosted by CQISE,\u201d said Reano. \u201cThe event will expose the SDK and the use of real qubits to the larger student body, highlighting what\u2019s possible with this powerful technology.\u201d Tag: atiq double-arrow Faculty Profile Atiq, Syedah Zahra Professional Practice Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Clinical Faculty atiq.2@osu.edu double-arrow Related News September 18, 2023 Ohio State leads new global climate center on AI for biodiversity change, funded by NSF August 1 TALK: Towards a Distributed Learning Model for Teaching at Scale July 21, 2023 5G-OH, CSE, TDAI Talk Featuring Dr. David Joyner: Towards a Distributed Learning Model for Teaching at Scale June 2, 2023 CSE PhD Student Wins College of Engineering Graduate Award April 14, 2023 Four Ohio State students honored with Goldwater Scholarships March 21, 2023 Xiaodong Zhang receives 2023 Distinguished Scholar Award",

    "text_content": "A new field of science for global biodiversity | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News A new field of science for global biodiversity A new field of science for global biodiversity Posted: December 7, 2022 Her life\u2019s work had been leading to this moment, this decision. Still, it was a hard decision. The timing was rocky. After years of leading wildlife conservation efforts and animal ecology research that combine machine learning with biology, Tanya Berger-Wolf was being asked by colleagues across the United States to lead a proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to extract traits from images. It would eventually become a new field of science: imageomics . Tanya Berger-Wolf is pioneering the field of imageomics, which leverages machine-learning to help better understand our world's plants and animals. (Jodi Miller) It was November 2020, and Berger-Wolf was new to Ohio State. She was leading the\u00a0university\u2019s computer modeling and analytics response to COVID-19\u00a0while also learning the ropes for directing the\u00a0Translational Data Analytics Institute. \u201cI had just said no to three other requests,\u201d Berger-Wolf recalls. \u201cBut I had to say yes to this one. Imageomics is a culmination of many threads that I\u2019ve been working on my entire career.\u201d As a computational ecologist, Berger-Wolf was a founding member of Wildbook, a project of the nonprofit Wild Me . Those efforts and the broader collaboration with ecologists laid the groundwork for the Imageomics Institute, which will use the vast supply of worldwide images and videos \u2014 from scientific projects, digitized biological collections of natural history museums, citizen science efforts, online repositories (including Wildbook), and even social media platforms \u2014 to train machine learning algorithms to provide insight into animal (and plant) traits and applications to biodiversity and conservation. \u201cIt\u2019s a wondrous and amazing thing, quite frankly, to have Tanya leading this,\u201d says\u00a0Paula Mabee, a member of Imageomics\u2019 executive leadership team and chief scientist and observatory director for NSF\u2019s National Ecological Observatory Network, operated by Battelle. \u201cShe has a deep appreciation for biology and understands the multiple scales of biological research that require new approaches to trait discovery data.\u201d Understanding animal traits \u2014 from stripes on zebras to the behaviors of butterflies \u2014 is central to imageomics\u2019 mission because it provides a window into ecology and the evolution of a species, which can unlock critical information to improve conservation practices. \u201cMachine learning is the key for this,\u201d says Mabee, a biologist. \u201cRight now, what we know about traits is written in texts and locked in images. Her work will mobilize those images so we can actually use them. \u201cA lot of my work, and my team\u2019s work, has basically led to this moment. We can\u2019t move ahead without a visionary like Tanya, with her expertise and connections. The benefits are really wide-ranging from the standpoint of understanding and saving our planet.\u201d Can our phones help wildlife conservation efforts? In the past, species conservation efforts used approaches such as human observations, tagging, radio collars and flyover surveys to understand wildlife traits, behaviors and population dynamics. However, these methods are often inefficient, expensive and dangerous to both animals and humans. Moreover, they do not scale large regions or populations. Using images for machine learning, meanwhile, is a whole new ballgame. There are millions of images available, whether they come from museums and wildlife foundations, drones or trail cameras, research projects or your own camera. Those images can train machine learning tools to discover previously unknown animal traits. Those traits can indicate evolutionary patterns or ecological changes and unlock information that improves conservation practices. And it has a proven track record. Wildbook\u2019s work helped inform conservation and policy efforts for animals such as whale sharks, changing their IUCN Red List status from vulnerable to endangered and their population from stable to decreasing. Likewise, the same work altered how the Kenya Wildlife Service manages conservation for the endangered Grevy\u2019s zebra. That\u2019s because more information, more data, helps officials make better decisions and devote resources to the right areas. In fact, a lack of information is a major culprit in faulty conservation efforts. The IUCN Red List monitors the planet\u2019s biodiversity. Of the 150,000 species currently monitored, 20,469 have their conservation status as \u201cdata deficient\u201d and more than 66,580 have a population trend that is unknown. \u201cHow can we tell if our conservation practices are working if we don\u2019t have enough data?\u201d Berger-Wolf says. \u201cIf what we need is data, this is something we can do. And we can do it from this abundant data source: images. \u201cIf we can extract the necessary information to support conservation decisions directly from images, we can contribute to conservation in a meaningful way while engaging everybody in that process. That is both exciting and unique, and it\u2019s an amazing opportunity. That is the promise of imageomics.\u201d by Ross Bishoff, Ohio State Impact double-arrow Faculty Profile Berger-Wolf, Tanya Academic Director, Academic Affairs Administration Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Evolution Ecology and Organismal Biology Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track berger-wolf.1@osu.edu",

But there is a very real possibility that in the (near?) future, we will view this situation similarly to how we now view lead paint, fossil fuels and asbestos: a technological means to an end, that was used for a time because, at that stage, we did not have viable alternatives \u2013 and we did not fully appreciate the negative externalities that were being caused. Awareness of the unwanted side effects of the current ML data center centric paradigm is building. It couples to ML an alarming carbon footprint, a reliance to biased close-world datasets, serious risks to user privacy \u2013 and promotes centralized control by large organizations due to the assumed extreme compute resources. In this talk, I will offer a sketch of preliminary thoughts regarding how a data center free future for ML might come about, and also describe how some of our recent research results and system solutions (including the Flower framework -- http://flower.dev ) might offer a foundation along this path.

Before the new labs opened in autumn 2021, both departments had course sections that had to be repeated multiple times due to a lack of available seats. \u201cThe new labs provide an exceptional opportunity to improve how we teach a number of classes and significantly expand our teaching capabilities,\u201d said Integrated Systems Engineering Professor Guzin Bayraksan. \u201cThey also enhance our research by adding state-of-the-art computers and software.\u201d Baker Systems Engineering room 470 features 80 computer workstations, while the Michael, Dina and Cesare Morell Computer Lab next door in room 480 has 40 workstations. Those 120 new seats are also crucial for the CSE department, which has grown tremendously over the last two decades and now has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the College of Engineering. \u201cThe labs add 480 seats a day for us, which is crucial,\u201d said Computer Science and Engineering Professor Rafe Wenger. \u201cWe were bursting at capacity and didn\u2019t have enough labs to service our students.\u201d While planning to turn the former IT equipment storage rooms into shared computer labs began four years ago, a generous donation from industrial and systems engineering alumnus Michael Morell \u201993 and his wife, Dina, provided critical funding to ensure the project could move ahead. \u201cThis was a rare opportunity to express our gratitude to the university for providing the foundation for a career in technology while providing access to a facility for the next generation of the best and brightest innovators to thrive and reach their fullest potential,\u201d said Michael Morell. \u201cWe hope this gift positively impacts the learning experience for current and future students.\u201d Designed for in-person, distance and hybrid learning, both labs feature video and audio capabilities throughout. Big-screen monitors mounted along the perimeter of each room enable shared content viewing from any angle.\u00a0Zoom cameras are preset to easily allow instructors to make class recordings that students can refer to later. \u201cAs instructors, it\u2019s important to have a modern lab space where we can easily alternate between lecturing and going over examples to presenting an overview of the topic and then assisting students individually as they have questions or encounter problems,\u201d said CSE Senior Lecturer Naomi Zweben. \u201cThese renovated labs provide the perfect tools for giving students an ideal lab experience.\u201d Courses taught in the new labs autumn semester include introductory programming in C++, Java and Python; modeling and problem-solving with spreadsheets and databases; software development and design; engineering project management; stochastic modeling and simulation; and visual analytics and sensemaking. The labs are also equipped with advanced features such as classroom management and monitoring software that allows instructors to instantaneously broadcast, view student screens and collaborate. \u201cThis new computer lab has been an absolute joy to teach in and has enabled me to thread in much more hands-on computing activities together with immersive, interactive lessons,\u201d said ISE Assistant Professor Mike Rayo. \u201cThe combination of having workstations for 80 students and an open, spacious classroom facilitates both planned and impromptu individual and group activities. These activities cement what I'm teaching by allowing students to practice utilizing visual analytics concepts immediately after we learn them together.\u201d The rooms were also designed to allow more space between workstations so instructors can easily walk around the room, view students\u2019 work and provide one-on-one assistance. \u201cBaker Systems Engineering 470 has a great layout that allows for both working alone and in groups. The aisles are open enough for larger groups to congregate around a single computer if needed for the projects we worked on,\u201d said Xandra Taskey, an ISE major. \u201cI truly enjoyed using room 470 for my course. The open space and many screens made learning and collaboration easier than a traditional room.\u201d During evenings and weekends, the labs are also available to all undergraduate and graduate ISE students to work on projects and research. \u201cIt was nice coming into this space and collaborating with my peers on different group assignments. A lot of students would meet here, hang out and do our work,\u201d said Olivia Weatherly, an ISE major. \u201cThis room was great for group work, in-class collaboration, independent work and research.\" Originally posted in the College of Engineering\u2019s annual giving impact report, Forward .",

Pixar Animation Studios Chief Technical Officer Steve May presented the Dave and Margie Williams Distinguished Lecture last month, \u201cEngineering and the Illusions of Life.\u201d The distinguished engineering alumnus shared his path from The Ohio State University to Pixar, how Pixar fuses art and engineering to create Academy Award-winning films, and the company\u2019s latest, groundbreaking innovations. The Williams Distinguished Lecture Series was established in 2019 by a generous gift from College of Engineering Dean Emeritus David B. Williams and his wife, Margie Williams. The fund support lectures in the College of Engineering by individuals with a technical background who work in business, industry, government or at a foundation. May\u2019s tenure at Pixar Animation Studios spans more than 24 years. In his current role as CTO, he supports all technology at the studio, including software R&D, information systems, RenderMan, and the development of visual effects tools and processes for each film. He started as a shading and modeling technical director on \u201cToy Story 2.\u201d For Pixar\u2019s next film, \u201cMonsters, Inc.,\u201d he helped to pioneer the fur technology and overall look for the character Sullivan. He went on to work as a supervising technical director for \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been at Pixar for awhile and you sometimes forget how cool it is that we make things that feel like they\u2019re alive\u2014the characters in our movies,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s still magical. What\u2019s also interesting is there is a ton of engineering and technology behind every frame of animation that we make at Pixar.\u201d May\u2019s lifelong love of art and technology, and an article in a 1984 issue of Science magazine, led him to choose a career in computer graphics, attend Ohio State and work at Pixar. Featuring a computer-generated image by a future Pixar colleague, the article highlighted, among others, former Ohio State Professor Emeritus Charles Csuri, who is considered to be the father of computer art. \u201cI loved my time at Ohio State. I took every course and did everything I could related to computer graphics. I worked at ACCAD [the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design]. I did medical visualization with Don Stredney at the Ohio Supercomputer Center,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked on a couple of our own animated films. I wrote the animation system we used. I wrote the renderer we used.\u201d At ACCAD, May taught a class on digital lighting for art students and showed them how to write shaders\u2014short programs that generate patterns in surface materials of 3D objects. Teaching students with no experience how to program was a pivotal moment for May, \u201cIt was really inspiring. It\u2019s influenced how I think about things today\u2014bringing art and technology together and supporting people to do things they maybe didn\u2019t think they could do.\u201d Sharing Pixar\u2019s frequent refrain that, \u201cArt challenges the technology and technology inspires the art,\u201d May discussed some of Pixar\u2019s most notable and newest innovations. These include RenderMan, Pixar\u2019s Academy Award-winning 3D rendering technology, and Presto, their proprietary animation system. \u201cPixar has a really, really long legacy of research in computer graphics and computer science, things like compositing, subdivision of surfaces, particle systems, character animation \u2026 many areas of rendering including motion blur, shaders and RenderMan,\u201d May said. Noting the studios are \u201calways looking for new ways to apply technology to make better movies,\u201d May said they also do a lot of work in AI and machine learning. A more recent innovation, the open-source Universal Screen Description or USD is making waves outside the film industry and has been called the \u201cHTML of the metaverse.\u201d The open-source software is used to describe everything in a scene. \u201cIt\u2019s like a definition, a recipe, of everything that\u2019s there\u2014the geometry, the shapes, the cameras, the lights, the materials and everything,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe think USD allows us to do scenes that are about 100 times more complex than we could do before. USD allows us to make really complex virtual worlds.\u201d Sharing that computer graphics is experiencing a second resurgence and people who understand technology, graphics and making content are very much in demand at Pixar, May encouraged interested students to learn as much as they can and experiment with free animation software. \u201cThere\u2019s so much material available. There\u2019s free software now you can download and do animation, just start doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, animation is super interdisciplinary, so study films, and draw, and do some programming. It\u2019s super helpful, if you\u2019re more interested in technology, that you still understand aspects of the artistic part of it, or the story part of it or the filmmaking part.\u201d May received a PhD in computer science and engineering, as well as bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from Ohio State. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the College of Engineering in 2011. by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu",

Invited Speaker : Murali Annavaram ,\u00a0Lloyd Hunt Chair Professor,\u00a0University of Southern California Abstract: Privacy and security-related concerns are growing as machine learning reaches diverse application domains. The data holders want to train or infer with private data while exploiting accelerators, such as GPUs, that are hosted in the cloud. Cloud systems are vulnerable to attackers that compromise the privacy of data and integrity of computations. Tackling such a challenge efficiently requires exploiting hardware security capabilities to reduce the cost of theoretical privacy algorithms. This talk will describe my group\u2019s experiences in building privacy preserving machine learning systems. I will present DarKnight, a framework for large DNN training while protecting input privacy and computation integrity. DarKnight relies on cooperative execution between trusted execution environments (TEE) and accelerators, where the TEE provides privacy and integrity verification, while accelerators perform the bulk of the linear algebraic computation to optimize the performance. The second part of the talk will focus on an orthogonal approach to privacy using multi-party computing (MPC). We present detailed characterisation of MPC overheads when executing large language models in a distributed manner. We then present MPCpipe a pipelined MPC execution model that overlaps computation and communication in MPC.

    "text_content": "Ohio State leads new global climate center on AI for biodiversity change, funded by NSF | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Ohio State leads new global climate center on AI for biodiversity change, funded by NSF Ohio State leads new global climate center on AI for biodiversity change, funded by NSF Posted: September 18, 2023 The Ohio State University will lead a new multimillion dollar international center devoted to using artificial intelligence to help understand climate impacts on biodiversity. The AI and Biodiversity Change (ABC) Global Climate Center will bring together ecologists and computer scientists from six universities in the United States and Canada, with partners in UK, Europe, and Australia, to develop new AI-enabled, data-supported approaches to study how changes in climate are impacting life \u2013 including animals, plants and insects \u2013 on Earth. The National Science Foundation awarded $5 million to researchers at Ohio State as the lead institution, as well as the University of Pittsburgh and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. About $3.75 million was awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to researchers at McGill University, the University of Guelph and the University of British Columbia. The team also includes core partners in the UK from University of Bristol and the University of Edinburgh; the University of Monash in Australia;\u00a0EPFL\u00a0in Switzerland; and\u00a0WILDLABS. The principal investigators of the center at Ohio State are Tanya Berger-Wolf , faculty director of the\u00a0Translational Data Analytics Institute\u00a0(TDAI), and Marta Jarzyna , assistant professor of\u00a0evolution, ecology and organismal biology\u00a0(EEOB) and a core faculty member of TDAI. \u201cClimate change is affecting every aspect of life on Earth,\u201d said Berger-Wolf, who is also a professor of\u00a0computer science and engineering, EEOB, and\u00a0electrical and computer engineering. \u201cThe problem is that we have this huge data problem: We don\u2019t have enough data about the impacts of climate on many species, and the data we do have is messy and not aligned. And that is where AI can come to the rescue.\u201d Researchers in the project will conduct fundamental AI research and develop and use new AI-based methods and tools to analyze data from camera traps, sound recorders, images from satellites and low-flying aircraft, DNA sequences and citizen science efforts. They will develop new and extend existing ecological models to leverage that data and AI approaches. \u201cThis will enable us to monitor, analyze, assess, and understand biodiversity changes around the world,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. One example: Researchers will develop new AI-informed ecological models to detect and understand how and why species are moving their ranges north across the border from the United States to Canada as the climate warms, potentially serving as an early warning system. They will study 222 species of birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles that currently breed within 800 km (about 500 miles) of the border. They will use AI analysis of satellite images and extend ecological models to determine how habitat changes might influence northward movement of species. Acoustic sensors, camera traps and DNA barcodes \u2013 which can identify species \u2013 will help document the species\u2019 move north. And AI-enabled identification of photos from partner citizen science initiatives such as iNaturalist, eBird, eButterfly and Bumble Bee Watch will also show the progression of species as they approach Canada. The findings should be able to provide early warning when various species are likely to move beyond their current ranges and into new areas in Canada not previously recorded. \u201cThe goal is to help develop the understanding of the mechanisms of negative impacts on biodiversity due to climate change so that we may develop interventions to mitigate them,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. In addition to the researchers from the six universities, the project includes more than 50 partners in the United Kingdom, Australia, Africa, India, Central America and the European Union.\u00a0 These partners are not just in academia, but also in governments, non-governmental organizations and industry. The partners will provide research collaboration networks, field data collections, data curation and hosting, community building, access to computational resources, tech transfer and open source tool development, and education and capacity building. Engaging broader communities beyond academia is an integral aspect of the center, Berger-Wolf said. \u201cEducation, outreach training and community engagement are an important part of what we will do,\u201d she said. Citizen science will have an important role: Members of the public will contribute to the center\u2019s work when they submit their photos and sightings to apps like eBird and iNaturalist, Berger-Wolf said. The ABC Global Climate Center is part of the NSF-led Global Centers program , an effort implemented with international funders \u201cto encourage and support large-scale collaborative research on use-inspired themes in climate change and clean energy.\u201d Ohio State is the ideal institution to lead the ABC Global Climate Center, Berger-Wolf said, due to the concentration of researchers working on related topics who have made the university a leader in those relevant areas. For example, in 2021 Ohio State was awarded $15 million from NSF to create the Imageomics Institute , which is developing a new field of study in which scientists use images of organisms as the basis of understanding biological processes of life on Earth. \u201cAI for biodiversity is a growing field of distinction for Ohio State,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a wide range of expertise in AI, natural resources, ecology and climate that very few institutions can match.\u201d by Jeff Grabmeier, Ohio State News Tag: Faculty News Related News October 25, 2024 Dr. Anish Arora Named Distinguished Professor of Engineering October 14, 2024 CSE Researchers Recognized with IEEE VIS Technical Achievement and Best Paper Award September 20, 2024 CSE Researchers Honored with the 2024 VLDB Endowment Test of Time Award More News",

Date: Tuesday, Nov. 7 from 10:30AM to 11:30AM Location: Cockins Hall 240 (1958 Neil Ave, Columbus) Abstract: For years, my dream has been to create autonomous AI agents capable of carrying out tedious tasks, allowing me to focus on more creative and exciting tasks. Modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have suddenly brought us much closer to achieving such AI agents. But, has my dream already come true? In 2020, I started research on AI agents, through my experience, I have recognized LLMs as a crucial yet early step in the broader landscape of AI agent research. While LLMs show promising results on well-specified tasks such as drafting and sending emails or answering everyday questions, they struggle with more complex tasks such as coordinating a meeting for multiple participants. Such tasks often span a long horizon and require a wealth of procedural knowledge and dynamic interaction with the environment. Current LLMs cannot perform such challenging tasks with consistent accuracy and even may pose safety risks due to their unpredictable behavior. In this talk, I will present three thrusts in my research toward this dream: the formalism of planning and acting, the learning of open-domain procedural knowledge, and the evaluation of AI agents. Bio: Shuyan Zhou ( https://shuyanzhou.com ) is a final-year Ph.D. student from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Graham Neubig. She studies autonomous AI agents and she aims to create AI agents that could perform tedious tasks so that everyone can focus on more creative and interesting tasks. Before joining CMU, she received her B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology.",

The fourth time was the charm for computer science and engineering major David Novikov, and his teammates, who took top honors at HackOHI/O X with their distracted driving alert device. Described as an invention marathon, HackOHI/O welcomes students from any major or university to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. More than 800 students participated in the hybrid event on October 8-9, 2022, and 75 teams submitted projects for judging. \u201cHackOHI/O is about building prototypes and supporting folks who are going above and beyond to bring big ideas to life in a tangible way,\u201d said OHI/O Director Cal King. \u201cStudents get the opportunity to ideate, design and then demo their projects, all within a 24-hour sprint.\u201d Novikov and Khalan Le (information systems), Kiran Wijesooriya (pre-computer and information science) and University of Toledo student Estevan Ortega trained a machine learning model to detect when drivers aren\u2019t paying attention to the road and alert them via a custom-programmed Arduino circuit board mounted to a vehicle\u2019s dash. When a driver is distracted, the alerts progress from a red light to a buzzer to a vibration. \u201cDistracted driving causes about 68.3% of all crashes,\u201d said Le in the team\u2019s project overview video . \u201cAnd if we can alert the driver that their behavior is dangerous, we can make a difference in the future.\u201d Despite Novikov\u2019s previous four years of HackOHI/O experience and his team\u2019s decision to \u201cplay to their strengths and get a project out the door,\u201d he was in disbelief after hearing that they won first place and an Apple iPad Air for each team member. The team\u2019s solution also earned second place and $600 in Amazon gift cards in Honda\u2019s Universal Basic Mobility corporate challenge. \u201cWhen we got first, I was like, \u2018That's probably a typo,\u2019\u201d Novikov said. \u201cIt was just a fun way to spend a weekend. That we won was a nice little added bonus, because as a team we worked well together and it was good to see that we were able to produce something that worked.\u201d During the past 10 years, HackOHI/O has grown from 100 students coding in the basement of Thompson Library in 2013 to Ohio\u2019s largest hackathon. Co-founder Arnab Nandi, associate professor of computer science and engineering, was inspired to launch the event to bring the \u201chacker culture\u201d of coding and building to Columbus. He teamed with fellow co-founder Meris Longmeier, head of research services for University Libraries, who was looking to extend the libraries\u2019 impact as a facilitator of communities. While he was a student, Chris Wallace \u201915 also helped organize the inaugural hackathon. \u201cSince then, it\u2019s been a snowball effect of like-minded people joining and building on top of the past years\u2019 successes,\u201d Nandi said. \u201cCelebrating the joy of building, hacking, making in tech\u2014I\u2019d like to think that OHI/O has helped further that on campus and in students\u2019 lives.\u201d Following the popularity of its signature hackathon, the OHI/O program introduced spin-off events, including Ohio State\u2019s first hardware-focused makethon in 2015, as well as a hackathon for high schoolers and a showcase of entrepreneurial ventures by faculty, students and alumni in 2017. \u201cOHI/O has cultivated a curious and well-connected community of tech-focused students by providing supportive spaces that rewards tech exploration across a variety of industries and education fields,\u201d explained King. Beyond providing hands-on experience, HackOHI/O has also had lasting impacts on students\u2019 future careers. A positive experience at High School I/O sparked Adit Anup\u2019s interest in hackathons. The second-year computer science and engineering major helped promote HackOHI/O last year before being elected co-lead in 2022. He\u2019s one of more than 30 student volunteers who made HackOHI/O X possible. \u201cIt's a great opportunity to network with other people,\u201d Anup said. \u201cEven though I was an organizer, I was able to talk with recruiters at HackOHI/O and actually landed an internship at a Fortune 500 company.\u201d Computer science and engineering major Sarah Keck also found the experience to be a helpful example to share with potential employers. She and teammates Mark Fong (computer science and engineering), Quincy Barrett (computer and information science) and Phillip White (pre-computer science and engineering) earned third place for their software solution that enables devices with two cameras, such as drones or robots, to locate people and determine distance during search-and-rescue events. \u201cIt's been a good talking point for all the hiring things I've been doing for internships,\u201d said Keck. \u201cIt's worth it to try [HackOHI/O] if you have a good idea going in or friends who might have good ideas.\u201d The team plans to continue developing their idea at MakeOHI/O\u2014the university\u2019s hardware-focused makeathon\u2014next spring and create a drone that they can use to deploy their software. Other winning projects included a mobile navigation app that provides audio cues to help the visually impaired and elderly, a safety app that helps users find the nearest campus emergency blue-light phone locations and a speech-to-code program. More than $10,000 in prizes were awarded. HackOHI/O X was funded by sponsors Honda, American Electric Power Foundation, Veeva, Root, ENGIE, Amazon Web Services, Battelle, Fuse by Cardinal Health, JobsOhio, Aware, Stevens Capital Management, Rev1 Ventures and Deloitte. by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu Tag: Hack OHI/O Related News There are currently no related news items.

She aims to use the skills she gained in the computer science and engineering master\u2019s program to help people in developing countries one day. This Sunday, May 5, 2024 , the college will welcome more than 1,700 new alumni into the Buckeye Engineering family.\u00a0Zeleke is one of six inspiring members of the Class of 2024 who are driven to make a difference. \u201cOne of the goals I have is using health care machine learning models for developing countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m from Ethiopia, so I want to make sure that these advantages are provided to people who live in underdeveloped and developing countries as well.\u201d Growing up, Zeleke was inspired to study computer science by her brother, who earned a PhD in the discipline. After learning a coding language and creating her own projects, she was hooked. \u201cI started in high school, playing around with Python, creating some things and genuinely thought it was cool,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn't that common, at least at the time, for women to be in the tech space to that extent. But it was something that I wanted to do.\u201d Following in her brother\u2019s footsteps, Zeleke came to the United States and earned a bachelor\u2019s from Calvin University in Michigan. After graduation, she wanted to learn more. While exploring graduate schools, she was impressed by the expertise and real-world impact of Ohio State\u2019s computer science and engineering faculty. \u201cThere's no place else that was able to beat the things the professors here have accomplished and [conduct] research on,\u201d she said. Zeleke\u2019s thesis research focuses on AI and ethics, primarily in health care. Her advisors\u2014Computer Science and Engineering Professor Tanya Berger-Wolf and Professor Xia Ning\u2014were critical to the success of her research. \u201cI came with this broad idea of what I wanted to do and they helped me narrow it down, find the data and streamline the whole research process. And it was the greatest research that I have done, in my opinion,\u201d Zeleke explained. \u201cWe work on trying to understand a bias performance trade-off of health care algorithms to primarily understand the impact of using demographic data to train the models.\u201d Zeleke created a general framework that allows developers to test their models to ensure they are unbiased against all patient groups and result in the best performing model for the given application. A paper she wrote about the work was accepted for publication by the 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence. She also completed a data science internship at Liberty Mutual Insurance and was a teaching assistant for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). After graduation, Zeleke will be an engineer at Barclays in New Jersey. She credits the financial support and mentorship she received from the CSE department as being key to her success. \u201cThe computer science and engineering department has been so helpful and that was really important to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey were there every step of the way.\u201d See the full list of the six inspiring members of the Class of 2024 originally featured in a College of Engineering story by Candi\u00a0Clevenger, College of Engineering Communications, clevenger.87@osu.edu .",

    "text_content": "Expanding access to computing education at scale | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News Expanding access to computing education at scale Expanding access to computing education at scale Posted: July 1, 2024 Virtually everything in our lives is impacted by computers. Therefore, understanding the principles of computing is rapidly becoming an essential skill. Today\u2019s students, regardless of major, will increasingly rely on computing skills and knowledge throughout their lives, so opportunities to learn the fundamentals of computer science must also increase. In response to the needs of students and companies in search of talent, The Ohio State College of Engineering is launching the Center for Computing Education. With partnership from multiple colleges in the university, the Center for Computing Education will create, teach and clearly actualize the principles that connect computing and society while transforming the delivery of foundational computer science concepts into accessible formats for diverse learners. By autumn semester 2025, the new center will provide multiple pathways for Ohio State students in all majors to infuse and blend computing into their learning. All students matriculating from Ohio State will be able to attain basic competency in burgeoning computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, with some choosing to acquire more programming skills or blend computing into their curriculum. Students collaborating during a recent OHI/O makeathon The Center for Computing Education\u2019s inaugural director is Engineering Education Associate Professor Monique Ross , who has a joint appointment in Computer Science and Engineering. Faculty members who focus on inclusive computer science pedagogy will design and teach most of the new courses in computing, AI, software development and data analytics. A report by LinkedIn and Microsoft revealed that 149 million new digital jobs will be created by 2025 in fields such as software development, data analysis, AI and cybersecurity. However, higher education cannot currently meet the growing demand for people with computer science skills. Demand for Computer Science and Engineering and Computer and Information Science degrees at Ohio State reflect national trends. Over the last decade, enrollment in computer science programs has grown sharply to more than 4,100 students. There is far more demand for the skills these degrees offer than there is capacity. \u201cThe exponential growth in the need for computing and AI skills is impacting the future of work in a profound manner,\u201d explained Dean of Engineering Ayanna Howard. \u201cThrough the active engagement of faculty and staff throughout Ohio State, the center will train the next generation of professionals that can couple their selected discipline with the computing skills needed to effectively adapt to the workforce demands of the future.\u201d By offering a broad swath of academic and professional offerings, the Center for Computing Education will serve as a hub for computing education on campus \u2013 a unit that will lead and facilitate computing and computing-infused programs. By harmonizing curriculum development, course offerings, and student advising and mentoring, the center will realize efficiencies for operating at scale and create distinctive offerings to meet a variety of academic objectives. \u201cOhio State undergraduates urgently need critical computing skills, and the state of Ohio urgently needs a more computer-savvy workforce,\u201d said Ohio State Vice Provost and Dean for Undergraduate Education Norman Jones. \u201cThe new Center for Computing Education will enable us to meet these intertwined needs, which will help accelerate our students\u2019 career development.\u201d Enrolled students will evolve into unique scholars fluent in digital and computational thinking and ready to meet societal needs given their unique skill sets. This evolution will also address the need for workforce development programs that meet the unique needs of our state and our nation in health care, digital agriculture, next-generation networking, cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing, including semiconductor fabrication. \u201cDigital is an increasing influence in all aspects of our lives and understanding how it works and how to leverage it is incredibly important for our community,\u201d said Shereen Agrawal, executive director of Ohio State\u2019s Center for Software Innovation . \u201cThe Center for Computing Education is a key component to delivering this access and education.\u201d Posted originally in College of Engineering\u00a0News .",

Ruoqi Liu\u2019s Talk Title: From Observational Data to Actionable Healthcare: Deep Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is a fundamental problem in many fields that face challenges (e.g., expensive, time-consuming, or even unethical) in running randomized control trials. Classical causal inference methods often underperform with high-dimensional data (where estimation bias increases with dimensionality) or non-tabular data (which leads to information loss during feature engineering for text, images, EHRs, etc.). To overcome these challenges, I have developed new methods that integrate deep learning with causal inference for actionable healthcare using real-world patient data. First, I have developed a deep learning-based propensity score model for representing high-dimensional data and adjusting for confounding bias and leveraged the estimated average treatment effects for emulating clinical trials for drug development. Second, I have developed a deep learning-based balancing-matching method for controlling time-dependent and hidden confounders and leveraged the estimated individual treatment effects for clinical decision-making in antibiotic stewardship for sepsis. Finally, I have developed (knowledge-enhanced) foundation models for treatment effect estimation, which are pre-trained on large-scale patient data (and biomedical knowledge graph) to learn contextual patient representations and fine-tuned on small-scale patient data for estimating causal effects. In future work, I aim to continue exploring this interdisciplinary field by developing and deploying end-to-end deep learning and causal inference approaches in real-world clinical scenarios yielding new theoretical advances and practical impacts, with the goal of improving patients' well-being and extending their lifespans.

The department is dedicated to providing a rigorous and advanced learning environment for students with diverse career goals of science, engineering and applications. CSE faculty, students and research fellows aim to make innovations and contributions to advance computing technologies and applications for the benefit of our students, our university, the State of Ohio, and the nation. The State of Ohio supports our program, but those contributions fund just a fraction of the actual cost of educating our students.\u00a0We rely on external grants and research funds to support these efforts, but more importantly, we depend heavily on the contributions of alumni and friends who support our efforts. A donation to CSE can provide support for a student\u2019s educational expenses, maintain our education and research facilities, or enhance our overall program offerings. Supporting CSE Students With continued generous donations by our alumni and friends, the CSE department is able provide scholarships to select CSE students each year. These scholarships make a tremendous impact on the academic careers and lives of our students. More than half of Ohio State students take out loans to pay for school, with an average debt per borrower of $26,932. Your decision to donate to a CSE scholarship has never been more important. Help us expand our scholarship funds to enable more CSE students to stay in school and complete their degrees. Click here to give to the CSE Department Scholarship Fund. Supporting the CSE Department Research grants and state contributions only provide a small portion of the funding needed for CSE to remain a leader in teaching and research. If you are interested in supporting the department\u2019s areas of greatest need, including faculty and program support, click here (link) to give to the CSE Department Priority Fund. Ways to Give There are many ways to give to the Computer Science and Engineering Department, including establishing an endowed or support fund, or contributing to the CSE fund of your choice.

Each winner receives a prize and/or cash award at the discretion of the department chair, along with recognition on a permanent plaque displayed in the department. Faculty, staff, and students affiliated with the department may make nominations. The department chair, with the advice of an ad hoc committee appointed by the chair, evaluates the nominations and selects winners. Each award may have zero or more winners in a given year, based on the number and quality of the nominations, though typically there will be one winner in most categories and a few in the others. Eligibility Eligibility for each award is evident from the title of the award, except in two cases. Any faculty member, staff member, or student who has been in the department for at least one year at the time of nomination may win the Service Award. The Chair's Special Service Award is reserved for someone who is not a regular employee of the department, yet who has made outstanding contributions to the department over a number of years. A winner of any award during the past three years is ineligible to win that award again, but is eligible for other awards. The Staff Years of Service Recognition is determined objectively. The department's human resources officer, at the chair's request, reports the names of staff members who have just achieved the milestones of 20 years and 30 years of service with the department.

    "text_content": "CSE Researchers Honored with the 2024 VLDB Endowment Test of Time Award | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home News CSE Researchers Honored with the 2024 VLDB Endowment Test of Time Award CSE Researchers Honored with the 2024 VLDB Endowment Test of Time Award Posted: September 20, 2024 CSE Professor Xiaodong Zhang and former Research Scientist Rubao Lee were honored with the 2024 VLDB Endowment Test of Time Award at the International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB) in August. This recognition was awarded for their co-authorship of the 2013 VLDB paper \u201cHadoop-GIS: A High-Performance Spatial Data Warehousing System Over MapReduce.\u201d Co-authors include Ablimit Aji, Fusheng Wang, Hoang Vo, Qiaoling Liu, and Joel Saltz from Emory University. Each year, the VLDB Endowment selects one paper from those published 10 to 12 years earlier that has best stood the \u201ctest of time\u201d. The Endowment particularly values the impact of the paper in products and services, while also considering its significance to the academic community. The Hadoop-GIS project originated as a research collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, and the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University over 14 years ago. The researchers released open-source software Hadoop-GIS in 2010, and subsequently presented and published the work in VLDB 2013. This project pioneered a new direction by initiating the development of a completely different spatial data analytical ecosystem, being notable for its large-scale capacity in both computing and data storage, high scalability, compatibility with low-cost commodity processors in clusters, all built on open-source software. With the impact of Hadoop-GIS over the past decade of R&D, this ecosystem has evolved and matured, now supporting numerous applications across various fields. Hadoop-GIS has influenced both commercial software, such as Esri\u2019s GeoAnalytics Server and Precisely\u2019s Location Analytics software and its dynamics weather service software, and open-source software, such as Apache Sedona that is the most widely used tool for many spatial data analytics applications today. Following the Award Ceremony, Professor Fusheng Wang from Stony Brook University and Professor Xiaodong Zhang from The Ohio State University were invited to deliver a presentation titled \u201cThe Advancement of Cluster-based Spatial Data Analytical Ecosystems.\u201d At the beginning of the twenty-first century, \u201cthe big data\u201d became a serious reality following years of rapid advancement of the Internet and extensive development in computer architecture and storage systems. The volume of data generated by various applications began to grow at an unprecedented rate, challenging conventional data analytics methodologies and limited scalability of commercial databases that could not be maintained at affordable costs for most users. For many years, mainstream R&D of computer systems development focused on scale-up, or vertical scaling, which involved increasing the capacity of a powerful and centralized computer systems by adding more hardware and software resources. Reflecting on that pivotal time, Professor Xiaodong Zhang said, \u201cI am glad we stayed ahead of the curve 15 years ago to address big data challenges in a timely manner by developing several software solutions for storage systems and cluster-based data processing infrastructure, in addition to Hadoop-GIS. These include RCFile and ORC (ICDE\u201911 and VLDB\u201913), Hystor (ICS\u201911), and YSmart (ICDCS\u201911), all of which are widely adopted in production systems today.\u201d Rubao Lee and Xiaodong Zhang were in a conference in 2012 on big data research in 2012. Rubao, then a research scientist at Ohio State, played a major role in big data research during that time. The 2024 VLDB Conference took place in Guangzhou, China, attracting a record-breaking attendance of more than 1,500 participants. During this conference, the 50th anniversary was celebrated, and a special recognition was given to the VLDB founder, David K. Hsiao (1933-2020). Professor Hsiao who was on faculty at Ohio State from 1972 to 1982, created the VLDB Conference in 1975, and established the VLDB Endowment in 1980 in the State of Ohio. He was also the founding Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions of Database Systems in 1976.

Questions from OSU students in other departments: I am currently an undergraduate major in XYZ Department. I want to transfer to the CIS/CSE major. What should I do? Ans : See the admissions page (ignoring the portions that apply to non-OSU students). Be sure to read the pages that describe the prerequisites that students must complete before applying for major status. I am currently a graduate student in XYZ Department. I want to simultaneously pursue an undergraduate degree in the CSE Department. What should I do? Ans : It is generally not possible to simultaneously pursue a graduate degree and an undergraduate degree at OSU. If you want to pursue a graduate degree in this department, see the graduate program page. I am currently a graduate/advanced undergrad student in XYZ Department. I would like to take some of the more advanced classes offered by the CSE Department. Do I really need to take all the prerequisite courses? Ans : Students who know the material covered in the prerequisite courses do not have to take them before taking the course in question; but do not expect the instructor to go over the material from the prerequisite course because you have not taken the course. Note also that CIS and CSE majors get priority scheduling for courses beyond CSE 2221 taught by the department. Other students are admitted on a space-available basis. One course that might be of special interest to non-majors with a strong computing background is CSE 5022. Questions from current CSE/CIS majors and pre-majors: I am planning to graduate this term and just discovered that I am one hour short of the required number of tech elective hours. Can these hours be waived so I can graduate? Ans : No, sorry. All students are required to complete all the specified requirements. I have transfer credit for math courses. Can I use those as tech elective hours? Ans : That depends. If the credit is for advanced courses in some relevant topic, and if you do not have credit for another course on the same topic, this may be possible. Talk to your faculty advisor and to one of the advisors in the Advising Office. I have been programming since elementary school. Do I need to take all these intro courses? Ans : Most students, including those who have been programming for many years, do have to take all courses starting with CSE 2221 (1211, 1221, 1222, or 1223 should be taken only by students who have little or no programming experience; see placement test ). Note that CSE 2221-2231 form a tightly integrated sequence, so you typically cannot jump into the middle of the sequence. A (very) few students who have taken courses equivalent to the entire sequence may be able to test out of all three courses. If you think you might be one of these students, talk to one of the advisors in the Advising Office. I have done a lot of real programming in my work. Do I need to take all the beginning courses? Ans : All students are required to complete all the curricular requirements (but also see the previous as well as the next question and the answers). I know most of the material in course CSE xxxx although I have not taken an equivalent course anywhere. Can I get credit for the course? How? Ans : If you do know most or all of the material in a given course, you may be able to get \"EM\" (examination) credit for the course (please consult with the course coordinator for the particular course (see the \" course syllabi \" link from the departmental homepage to see who the coordinator for the course is) about this. He or she will probably ask you to take an exam similar to a final exam for the course and then decide whether or not you should receive EM credit for the course. If you get EM credit for a course, you will not have to take that course. I am a CSE/CIS major. I was planning to take \"CSE uxyz\" this term. However, the course is not offered, and I have to graduate at the end of this term, and the course is required for my program. What do I do? Ans : You should have planned ahead. In some cases, it may be possible to find alternate courses that may be used to substitute for the course in question, but there is no guarantee of this. Talk to your faculty advisor and to one of the advisors in the Advising Office to see if there are any suitable substitutes. I am a CSE/CIS major. I was planning to take \"CSE uxyz\" but got closed out. What should I do? Ans : If you registered on time (i.e., when your registration window opened), you should not have been closed out; if in fact that is what happened, talk to one of the advisors in the Advising Office. If you registered late and hence got closed out, you may have to wait until the course is offered again. You may also want to try going to class for the first few days and see if there is room and whether the instructor will let you add the class. But note that this is up to the individual instructor. I am in the BS CIS program and got a D in the course \"CSE uxyz\". The Arts & Science College told me that I cannot use this course as part of my major program since my grade was less than C-. But my friend who is in CSE who also got D in the course is able to use the course as part of his major. Why is this, and isn't this unfair? Ans : This is because the ASC policies are different from those of the College of Engineering. It may be unfair but there is nothing the department can do about it. I am looking for a job/internship; please help! Ans : See the Co-op/Internships/Jobs page . I am about to graduate; what do I need to do? Ans : If you are a BS-CSE major, see the Handbook of the Engineering College's Committee on Academic Affairs , specifically pages 32-33 of the handbook for graduation requirements and procedures. If you are a BS-CIS or BA-CIS major, see the graduation procedures page. I am graduating this term. I have looked for my advisor but I can never find him/her. Help! Ans : Go to his/her office during office hours (you can find information about individual faculty member's office hours from the CSE main office\u00a0 in 395 Dreese Labs (tel: 292-5813)); send the person email; or call. If after several attempts, you are not able to reach your advisor, contact the Advising Office. (But please note that most faculty members are involved with a number of activities and may take a day or two to respond to your message.) I don't know who my faculty advisor is. I need to file my graduation application which needs the advisor's signature. Help! Ans : Your faculty advisor is listed on the first page of your Student Center. I do know who my faculty advisor is but he/she is not able to answer all the questions I have. Help! Ans : Talk to the Advising Office and explain what the problem is. They may be able to assign a new faculty advisor for you. My question is not answered here; help! Ans : Contact the Advising Office.

These requirements and the procedures for obtaining the degree are determined in part by the Graduate School, and in part by the Department. Petitions for exception to these requirements should be channeled through the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. Students in the M.S. program must be regular students as defined by the Graduate School regulations; special students and students enrolled in Continuing Education are not considered as regular students. In order to qualify for admission as regular students, students must first remove any restrictions placed on their status. Removal of restrictions is regulated by the Graduate School and the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee. The procedures and requirements described herein are subject to revision. Students should consult materials issued periodically by the Graduate School and the Department, their advisors, or the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for any changes or interpretation of policy. Program for the Master of Science Degree in CSE The program's philosophy is to provide students a broad graduate level education in the fundamentals of Computer Science and Engineering and also provide the opportunity for deeper study in a specialized sub-area of interest to the student. Students work out the details of their program in close consultation with their advisors. Two options are offered: Thesis Option (Research Track) Non-Thesis Option (Coursework Track) Program requirements for the Thesis Option and Non-Thesis Option are detailed in this document. The terms \"Research Track\" and \"Thesis Option\" are used interchangeably in this document. Similarly, the terms \"Coursework Track\" and \"Non-Thesis Option\" are used synonymously. 1 Advisors Students' degree programs and all courses taken by students must be approved by their academic advisors. Each student admitted to the graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is assigned a tentative academic advisor. Students should consult their advisors as soon as possible after arriving on campus, and periodically thereafter until, upon developing a specific specialty interest, a permanent advisor is chosen in that specialty area. When a student determines that his/her interests lie in a particular specialty area, he/she should choose a permanent faculty advisor in that area. This choice should be made as soon as practical, especially for students planning either to undertake thesis research or to enter the Ph.D. program. Students whose specialty interests change should consider changing to an advisor whose field encompasses their new interests. In exceptional cases, members of other departments who hold joint appointments as Graduate Faculty members of this Department may serve as research advisors for students, but in all cases, the student's academic advisor must be a faculty member whose primary faculty appointment is in this Department. If a change of advisor is needed, a \"Change of Advisor\" form is available through the Electronic Signature application called Docusign. The process begins by clicking on the following link which will send you an email and guide you in filling out the information needed: Change of Advisor Form . In addition to the above departmental academic and research advising, the Graduate School maintains a counseling office for students. 2 Requirements for the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Engineering This section contains a list of requirements for the Master of Science Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Students are advised to check the latest edition of the Graduate School Handbook for possible added requirements. 2.1 Credits The minimum number of cr-hrs required for the M.S. Degree is as follows: Research Track (requires thesis): 30 cr-hrs Coursework Track (no thesis): 33 cr-hrs Students in either track must satisfy the course requirements listed in Sec. 2.2 . 2.2 Degree Program Each candidate is required to pursue a program of study in courses approved by his/her academic advisor. Students in the thesis track need to complete 20 graded cr-hrs. Students in the non-thesis track need to complete 30 graded cr-hrs, or 24 graded cr-hrs and a masters project, as detailed in Section 2.4 . For students in either track, at most 6 cr-hrs from classes taken outside of CSE may count towards these requirements. These classes must be from disciplines closely related to CSE, and need to be approved in advance by the student's advisor. CSE6891 is an S/U graded course worth 1 credit hour that is required during the first Autumn term for every CSE graduate student. For meeting the course requirements for both research and coursework track masters programs, letter-graded classes at the 5000-level and above will be considered to be of four types: Graduate Pre-Core: These classes include graduate versions of classes that are either required for the CSE undergrad degree or are in a \"pick-list\" in the requirements for the CSE undergrad degree. These graduate versions will typically be offered for fewer cr-hrs than the equivalent undergrad courses. The list currently includes CSE 5231, CSE 5232, CSE 5241, CSE 5321, CSE 5331, CSE 5341, CSE 5421, CSE 5431, CSE 5461, CSE 5521, and CSE 5541. Both non-thesis and thesis students are limited to taking at most 6 cr-hrs from this group, to count towards their 20/24/30 graded cr-hr requirements. Graduate Core: This group includes graduate classes\u00a0on algorithms (CSE 6331), computability and unsolvability (CSE 6321), programming languages (CSE 6341), computer architecture (CSE 6421), and operating systems (CSE 6431).\u00a0All students must pass 3 foundational core classes, including algorithms, either computability and unsolvability or programming languages, and either computer architecture or operating systems: CSE 6331 CSE 6321 or CSE 6341 CSE 6421 or CSE 6431 Applied Core: The classes currently in this list include (CSE 5242 or CSE5243), CSE 5343, CSE 5441, CSE 5462, (CSE 5523\u00a0or CSE6521), and (CSE 5542 or CSE 5544). Notice that only one of the classes in each set of parentheses can count toward the applied core requirement. If the second course within a set of parentheses is taken, it can count for an elective; but both courses within each set of parentheses cannot count as an applied core. Students in the thesis option must take at least one class from this group, and students in the non-thesis option must take at least two classes from this group. All other letter-graded classes offered by the CSE department >= 5100\u00a0or non-CSE graduate courses approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. These classes can be taken, together with the requirements and restrictions on pre-core, graduate core, and applied core, towards meeting the 20/24/30 graded cr-hr requirements. Students who are able to transfer graduate credit for these classes or who took equivalent courses as undergraduates may substitute other appropriate courses in their program, with the approval of their advisors. 2.3 Thesis Each student on the Research Track must submit an approved thesis, based on appropriate research experience, in accordance with Departmental and Graduate School regulations. The Master's thesis must be produced under the direction and with the approval of the student's research advisor, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty. The Graduate School Handbook should be consulted for rules, procedures, and deadlines for preparation and submission of the final approved copy of the thesis. Each candidate (in either the Research Track or Coursework Track) must also pass a Master's Examination to test his/her knowledge of the course of study pursued. The rules governing the Master's Examination are given in Section 3 . 2.4 Project Option Masters non-thesis students may take 6 S/U cr-hrs over two consecutive semesters to complete a substantial implementation project with a CSE faculty member. A 6-8 page write-up on the features of the software and the design choices made must be completed and approved by the CSE faculty member supervising the project. This write-up should be included with the masters paperwork for the student (please also see details of the masters examination for project option below). These 6 cr-hrs will count towards the 30 graded cr-hr requirements for non-thesis students. 2.5 Residency and Transfer Credit Satisfactory completion of 24 cr-hrs of graduate credit (Research Track), or 27 cr-hrs of graduate credit (Coursework Track), over a minimum of two semesters at this university, is required. Students who transfer cr-hrs from other departments or other universities in order to qualify for the degree, must submit their Request for Application or Transfer of Credit no later than the second semester of enrollment in the graduate school. 2.6 Academic Standards A graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average over\u00a0all graduate credit courses, with no more than one-third of the cr-hrs with grades of C or lower. Students whose performance falls below the above standard are subject to the Graduate School rules which apply to probationary status or dismissal. In addition, a graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average in all courses applied towards the student's CSE degree. Only courses in which a graduate student has received a C (2.00) or higher may be applied to the student's CSE degree. 2.7 Application to Graduate and Declaration of Examination Forms* Students must submit an \"Application to Graduate\"\u00a0by the second Monday of the semester of expected graduation through the Graduate School's Gradforms Application .\u00a0For non-thesis option, a Declaration of Examination form by the eleventh week of the semester prior to the semester in which the degree is sought needs to be submitted. Visit CSE Portal: https://portal.cse.ohio-state.edu/cse-portal . For both applications, you will need to use\u00a0your OSU login information to sign up. Both forms require approval by the student's academic advisor before being considered\u00a0by the Department. Failure to submit these forms on time may result in the student not being able to graduate in the semester desired. No student will be allowed to take the Master's examination until he or she has received graduate credit for at least 16 cr-hrs at this university and reasonably can be expected to complete all of the requirements for the Master's degree in the semester for which the \"Application to Graduate\" form is filed. Students are expected to take the Master's examination by the time they have completed 33 cr-hrs. Any exceptions to this rule must be petitioned to the Graduate Studies Committee. * see the Graduate School handbook information here for final semester procedures 2.8 Time Limit The entire work for the Master's degree must be completed within a period of six calendar years. 3 Master's Examination A Master's Examination is required to test the candidate's knowledge of the courses of study he/she has pursued. Students must have filed an \"Application to Graduate\" form ( Section 2.7 ) before they can take this examination. If a student fails to perform satisfactorily on the Master's Examination and desires to take it again in order to get the Master's degree, he/she must enroll the following semester for at least 3 cr-hrs and take the final examination in that semester. Any exceptions to this rule must have the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. In accordance with Graduate School regulations, no student will be permitted to take this examination a third time. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe the details concerning the format and scheduling of the Master's Examination for students on the Research Track and Coursework Track. 3.1 Research Track (Thesis Option) The Master's Examination is held after the draft of the thesis is approved. Final thesis approval occurs after the examination. The examination must be oral and may include a written portion, at the option of the examination committee. The chair of the committee is to be the candidate's research advisor, and the committee must include at least one other member of the committee who is a member of the Graduate Faculty with primary appointment in the CSE Department. The Graduate Studies Committee may appoint additional members of the committee if it considers it necessary. The committee chair is responsible for arranging and conducting the examination, which is to be based on the subject matter of the thesis as well as the course of study which the candidate has pursued. The chair of the examining committee is also responsible for certifying the examination results and reporting them to the Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School office within the prescribed time set by the Graduate School. 3.2 Coursework Track (Non-Thesis Option) All candidates on the Coursework Track who do not finish a project must pass a written comprehensive examination composed of examinations in three of the five core areas, specifically, algorithms, either of computability and unsolvability or programming languages, and either of computer architecture or operating systems. Examination in each of the areas is of 120 minute duration, and these examinations are administered over a two day duration. Student who finish a project (described above), AND have a B average in the three core classes they are required to take, can take a masters examination based on their project. A masters examination based on project requires a committee with at least 2 CSE faculty members. This is an oral examination that should last at least 60 minutes, with time equally divided between the candidate's presentation and questioning from the committee. Students intending to take such an option need to finish a longer project report (at least 10 single spaced pages). 4 Master's Degree on Basis of Ph.D. Candidacy Examination Ph.D. students who have not previously obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering may be recommended for the Master of Science degree after taking their Ph.D.Candidacy Examinations under the following conditions: It is recommended by the student's advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee. The student does not already hold an equivalent master's degree in the same field. Graduation deadlines established by the Graduate School are met. The Graduate School Handbook is to be consulted for the applicable procedural details.

The department is not directly involved with admitting students to Ohio State. Pre-Majors Students new to OSU are not directly admitted to major status. Instead, they are admitted as pre-majors (pre-CSE, pre-CIS) and apply to enter the major after specific pre-requisite coursework has been completed. Pre-CSE To be directly admitted to pre-CSE, New First Year Students , must be directly admitted to the College of Engineering. Entry into the college is competitive and several factors are considered including ACT/SAT scores, strong college prep curriculum, class rank and GPA. For more information, please see the College of Engineering Admissions site. To be directly admitted to pre-CSE, Transfer student , must be directly admitted into the College of Engineering. Students must have: at least 30 credits of post-high school college credit, a 3.0 transfer GPA, and transfer credit for Math 1151 or higher. Students with less than 30 credit hours will be considered using the criteria for New First Year Students. For more information, please see the College of Engineering Admissions site. Pre-CIS To be directly admitted to pre-CIS, New First Year Students and Transfer Students, need to be admitted into the College of Arts and Sciences. After a student is accepted into the College of Arts and Sciences, there are no additional requirements they must fulfill. For more information, please see the College of Arts and Sciences site. Please note, starting Autumn 2023 Students will no longer be permitted to switch into the\u00a0Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Computer and Information Science or Mechanical Engineering pre-major programs Students interested in these programs must indicate one of the majors on the Common Application as pre-majors close once they reach capacity . Students will not have the ability to switch into one of these four pre-majors. Only students in these pre-majors may apply to their respective major. For example, only Computer Science and Engineering pre-majors are permitted to apply to the Computer Science and Engineering major. Aerospace Engineering Biomedical Engineering Computer Science and Engineering (ENG) / Computer and Information Science (ASC) Mechanical Engineering Application For Major Status To be admitted to a Computer Science major, student will need to meet specific GPA and course requirements. Pre-majors should submit their application to the major during the term in which they will complete the prerequisite requirements by completing the Application to Major . For any question students should\u00a0see\u00a0an undergraduate academic advisor in the Advising Office . Students must complete an application to be admitted to the major; simply completing the prerequisite courses does not automatically confer major status. For specifics for getting into each individual major, please see the majors page . Major status gives students access to faculty advisors, a permanent computer account, and priority scheduling for CSE courses. These are important benefits. Hence, if you plan to major in any of the programs in the department, and have completed the prerequisites, you should apply for admission to the major as soon as possible.

    "text_content": "Doctor of Philosophy Program | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Doctor of Philosophy Program Doctor of Philosophy Program double-arrow Program for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree in CSE The Doctoral degree is awarded for superior academic and research performance. Consequently, only students who have demonstrated outstanding scholastic ability and research potential will be admitted to the academic and research program leading to the Doctorate. The program of study for the Ph.D. is to be developed by the student in close consultation with his/her academic advisor. Students are encouraged to work out their plan of study as soon as possible so that all requirements may be met. Link List Program Requirements: PhD Major/Minor double-arrow Foreward This brochure, together with the Graduate School Handbook, contains a complete description of requirements and procedures for the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). These requirements and the procedures for obtaining the degree are determined in part by the Graduate School, and in part by the Department. Petitions for exception to these requirements should be channeled through the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. The material in this brochure is oriented primarily for students pursuing the Ph.D. program. Such students must be regular students, admitted to the CSE Department, and conform to Graduate School regulations; special students and students enrolled in Continuing Education must first remove any restrictions. Removal of restrictions is regulated by the Graduate School and the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee. These procedures and requirements are subject to revision. Applicants should consult material periodically issued by the Graduate School and the Department, their advisor, or the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for any changes or interpretation of policy. The Graduate School also maintains a counseling office for students enrolled in Ph.D. Programs. Program for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree in CSE Advisors single-arrow-square Each student entering the graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is initially assigned a tentative academic advisor. Students' degree programs and all courses taken by students must be approved by their academic advisors. Students should consult their advisors as soon as possible after arriving on campus, and periodically thereafter until, upon developing a specific specialty interest, the student chooses a permanent advisor in that specialty area. This choice should be made as soon as practical. The assignment of students to research advisors is performed by mutual agreement of the student and faculty member. The intent of this explicit agreement is to make students aware of the importance of early interactions with faculty in topic areas of mutual interest. Students are free to change their advisors when mutual research interests change. A \"Change of Advisor\" form is available through the Electronic Signature application called Docusign. The process begins by clicking on the following link which will send you an email and guide you in filling out the information needed: Change of Advisor Form . The Graduate School rules require that advisors for students in the Ph.D. program be Category P Graduate Faculty members, but it is permissible to have a Category M Graduate Faculty member as a co-advisor. The co-advisor may be the functioning advisor. In such cases, a Category P person should be included as an integral member of the research team early in the student's research, so there is a meaningful collaboration involving the Category M functioning advisor and the Category P advisor. The Graduate School requires that the Category P advisor sign the examination and thesis approval forms. Stages of Study single-arrow-square The requirements for a Doctoral degree in Computer Science and Engineering are determined in part by general Graduate School requirements for a Ph.D. degree, and in part by specific requirements stipulated by the department. The student should refer to the Graduate School Handbook for residency requirements, regulations concerning transfer of credit from other institutions, and for credit-hour requirements stipulated by the Graduate School. 2.1 Preliminary Requirement: Prior to entering the first stage of study toward the Doctoral degree, a student has to successfully complete the Ph.D qualifying process (see Section 3 ) as well as take CSE6891 (1 crhr S/U graded) during their first Autumn term. 2.2 First Stage: During the first stage of Ph.D. study, the student is required to undertake a program of study in a major area and two minor areas, and to formulate a dissertation proposal. At least 10 cr-hrs of coursework in the major area and 6 cr-hrs in each of the minor areas are required. This coursework cannot include graduate core classes that were used for the qualifying process. All of the 10 credits towards the major and at least 5 credits for each minor need to be from graded graduate classes. The student's research advisor serves as the advisor for the program of study in the major area. The student, in consultation with the research advisor, chooses the two minor areas of study and the minor area advisors. The courses comprising the program of study for the minor areas must be approved by the minor area advisors. The first stage of study toward a Doctoral degree is completed when the student has received credit for a total of 60 cr-hrs of graduate work in a program prescribed by the student's advisor and has passed the Candidacy Examination (see Section 5 ) to be formally admitted to candidacy. At least three months prior to taking the Candidacy Examination, a proposed schedule of study should be submitted to the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for consideration. 2.3 Second Stage: The second stage is devoted primarily to research and seminars, the preparation of the dissertation, and the Final Examination (see Section 6 ). The Final Examination is oral and deals intensively with the portion of the candidate's field of specialization in which the dissertation falls, though it need not be confined exclusively to the subject matter of the dissertation. The PhD Qualifications Process (Effective Autumn 2022) single-arrow-square Overall Requirements The CSE Ph.D. Qualifying Process consists of two components: one is coursework, and the other is research. To pass the Qualifying Process, a student needs to demonstrate satisfactory performance on both components: (1) Be competent and knowledgeable on fundamental principles of computer science and engineering, and (2) show promise for conducting original research in the areas of computer science and engineering. For the coursework component, a student needs to achieve the average GPA of 3.3 or above on four CSE courses that include a required Algorithms course (CSE 6331) and three other courses chosen by the student in consultation with the faculty advisor [1] . The three courses can be chosen from the seven categories listed below with at most one course from a single category. Note that a student may count one Qualifying course in this new Qualifying Process towards the major/minor course requirements in the Candidacy Exam. For the research component, a student is required to work with their faculty advisor and demonstrate satisfactory research progress [2] . Course Categories The seven categories of CSE courses include: (1) Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (CSE 6521, CSE 5523, CSE 5526, CSE 5243, CSE 5245) (2) Graphics and Visualization (CSE 5542, CSE 5543, CSE 5544, CSE 5545, CSE 5546) (3) Computer Networking (CSE 5462, CSE 5463) (4) Security and Privacy (CSE 5471, CSE5472, CSE 5473, CSE 5474) (5) Computer Systems (CSE 6431, CSE 6421, CSE 6333, CSE 5242, CSE 5441) (6) Software Engineering and Programing Languages (CSE 6341, CSE 5343) (7) Computer Theory (CSE 6321, CSE 6332, CSE 5351) Procedures and Timeline A Qualifying Process has two checkpoints: the first is by the end of Year 1 [2] and the second is by the end of Year 2 [3] . In the first checkpoint, a student reports the grades of the Qualifying courses that have been taken. The student will comment on their progress towards identifying a research advisor and making research progress. Early in the program, a student should identify research advisor(s) for the Ph.D. study. This may be the same as the initial academic advisor assigned by the Department, or a different faculty member. \u00a0The research advisor must be a member of the graduate faculty with \u201cP\u201d advising status in CSE. A student should declare the research advisor, even if she or he is the same as the initial academic advisor, by filing a Change of Advisor Form.\u00a0This form is available through the Electronic Signature application called Docusign. The process begins by clicking on the following link which will send you an email and guide you in filling out the information needed: Change of Advisor Form .\u00a0The research advisor will provide academic and research advice once the change of advisor form is submitted. In the second checkpoint, a student reports the grades of the Qualifying courses that have been taken. The student\u2019s faculty advisor will be contacted subsequently to provide input on the student\u2019s research progress. Based on the student\u2019s course work performance and the advisor\u2019s research assessment, the Grad Studies Committee will notify the student of the Qualifying Process result at the second checkpoint. Both checkpoint forms can be found at the CSE Portal . If a student does not achieve the GPA requirement with the first four courses, a student may (a) retake the same course (required for Algorithms), (b) take a different course in the same course category, or (c) take a course in another course category.\u00a0 This should be done in consultation with the faculty advisor. Students may file the second checkpoint form once they have achieved satisfactory performance on both coursework and research components, which could be earlier than the end of Year 2. Students should consult with their research advisor before submitting the second checkpoint form. To maintain the status of \u201cGood Standing\u201d in CSE [4] , a Ph.D. student is expected to pass the Qualifying Process by the end of Year 2. Otherwise, a student who is not in good standing will not have a guaranteed appointment as a graduate teaching associate. A student who continues to not return to good standing in a timely way (e.g., by the end of the third year) may be dismissed from the Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Engineering after a conversation among the student, advisor, and graduate studies committee. Implementation This new Ph.D. Qualifying Process will be effective starting from Autumn 2022. Specifically, a student who is enrolled in the Ph.D. program of CSE in Autumn 2022 or after can only take this new Ph.D. Qualifying Process. For a smooth transition, a student who was enrolled prior to Autumn 2022 may choose to take this new Qualifying Process or the old Qualifying Exam. Definitions and Criteria Faculty advisor : A student\u2019s initial academic advisor assigned by the Department, or the research advisor chosen by the student. The criteria of satisfactory research performance : The most common way of satisfying this requirement is for the student to be a leading or significant contributor on a paper published, accepted, submitted, or in preparation to submit to a venue in Computer Science. Faculty advisors may provide evidence that the student has satisfied this requirement in other ways, such as making a significant contribution in research artifacts such as released software packages. The end of Year x : Two weeks after the end of 2*x non-summer terms since a student\u2019s initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program of Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State University. Good Standing in CSE : In addition to the requirements from the Grad School , a Ph.D. student in CSE is required to pass the Qualifying Process by the end of Year 2. Students must also demonstrate English proficiency through one of the approved mechanisms listed on the \u201cEnglish as a Second Language\u201d website by the end of Year 1. Additional Notes While there is no accelerated option in the new policy of the PhD Qualifying Process, the accelerated option is still applicable to a student who was enrolled prior to Autumn 2022 if the student chooses to take the Qualifying Exam in the old policy. A student cannot transfer the credits of a Qualifying course from their prior institutes. If a student took a Qualifying course in the undergraduate program at Ohio State, the course can be counted towards the requirement of the Qualifying Process. However, the course credits cannot be counted towards their Ph.D. degree requirement except for the situations (such as the BS/MS program) allowed by the Graduate School. The PhD Qualifications Process (Admitted before Autumn 2022) single-arrow-square The Qualifying Examination is administered Autumn and Spring semesters. Satisfactory performance on this examination, or qualification through the acceleration option listed below, is necessary for admission to the first stage of study towards the Doctoral degree. The Qualifying Examination is based on the material covered in the graduate core areas. Specifically, students need to take the exam in algorithms (CSE 6331), either computability and unsolvability (CSE 6321) or programming languages (CSE 6341), and either operating systems (CSE 6431)\u00a0or computer architecture (CSE 6421). Students who have previously studied this material are not required to take the corresponding core courses(s) in the CSE Department; they need only demonstrate their competence in these areas by satisfactory performance on the Qualifying Examination. At the time students take the examination, they must have been admitted to the CSE Department and not be on probation. A student whose enrollment eligibility has been deactivated by the Graduate School may, if subsequently reactivated, be required to re-take the Qualifying Examination. A student who fails the qualifying examination for the first time must retake the examination the next semester that it is offered. Students must petition the Graduate Studies Committee to retake the examination in any other semester or to retake the examination more than once. Acceleration Option for Qualifying Exams : Students who complete the three graduate core classes (algorithms, either computability and unsolvability or programming languages, and either operating systems or computer architecture) with a GPA of 3.6 or better will be automatically granted a \"conditional pass\" in the qualifying examination. These students will need to demonstrate substantial research progress during their second year spring evaluation to remove the condition. One clear mechanism for demonstrating such progress is to have an accepted or submitted paper as a significant contributor, working on a project with their advisor. Fill out the online form in the CSE Portal to apply for the Accelerate option. Advisor must approve it online. The Candidacy Examination single-arrow-square This section further specifies the procedure set forth for the Candidacy Examination in the Graduate School Handbook. That section must be read in conjunction with this document for a full understanding of the rules governing the Candidacy Examination. The Candidacy Examination is a very important means by which the faculty can ensure that the prospective student has the necessary breadth and depth in chosen areas within computer and information science and cognate areas. The student is expected to demonstrate superior knowledge in his or her chosen areas. To be eligible for the Candidacy Examination, the student is required to select one major area and two minor areas. The student may choose any of the pre-defined major or minor areas specified in the \"Guidelines for the Ph.D. Candidacy Exam Major/Minor Areas\". To demonstrate mastery in the two minor areas, the student is required to obtain a GPA of 3.3 or higher in the letter-graded courses taken in each of two minor areas. To demonstrate mastery in the major area, the student is expected to prepare a dissertation proposal. The student and the student's major advisor may suggest two examiners who are competent in the student's major area. In the Candidacy Examination, the student will be examined in written and oral format over the major area and the dissertation proposal. 4.1 Proposed Schedule of Study The student is required to submit to the Graduate Studies Committee a proposed schedule of study for the candidacy examination at least three months in advance of the examination. The schedule should include the choice of major and minor areas, counter-signed by the student's major and two minor advisors, and the student's preliminary dissertation proposal, counter-signed by the student's major advisor and two other faculty members who will serve on the Candidacy Examination Committee. The schedule must also indicate those courses and individual studies already accomplished in each of the major and minor areas, together with additional work planned at this time. The Graduate School must be notified before the written portion of the Candidacy Examination begins. The form of the schedule of study can be downloaded here . 4.2 Declaration of Intent to Take the Candidacy Examination After the student's proposed schedule of study has been approved by the Graduate Studies Committee, the Candidacy Examination should be scheduled in consultation with the examination committee. At least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled oral examination date, the student should declare formally the intent to take the oral portion of the Candidacy Examination. This Declaration of Intent form must be signed by the student's major advisor and the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee before transmittal to the Dean of the Graduate School for approval. 4.3 The Candidacy Examination Committee The Examination Committee consists of at least four faculty members, including the student's major advisor, two other members of the Graduate Faculty approved by the Graduate Studies Committee for this function, and a departmental representative appointed by the Graduate Studies Committee. 4.4 Examination Format The Candidacy Examination consists of two parts, namely, a written examination and an oral examination. The precise times and places of the administration of the Examination will be determined by the Examination Committee, but the entire Examination must be administered within a three-month period. 4.4.1 Written Examination: The written portion is administered and evaluated by the student's Advisory Committee. It is conducted in the following steps. a. The student prepares a written dissertation proposal. The proposal should be concise and precise, and should include the following: Title and abstract Significance of the problem Scope and objectives of the research Methodology Expected results and conclusions Expected contributions to the state of art/literature Students are encouraged to include in the written portion any preliminary results that support the dissertation proposal. The dissertation proposal must be submitted to all members of the Advisory Committee. b. On receiving the dissertation proposal, the major advisor compiles a written examination for the student, taking into consideration questions posed by and comments received from the rest of the Advisory Committee. The written examination consists of two parts. The first part asks questions related to the submitted dissertation proposal. The purpose of this part is to examine whether the dissertation proposal has substantial depth to lead to quality research and whether the student is well prepared to conduct the research outlined in the proposal. The student may be asked to revise the proposal in accordance with the suggestions received. The second part examines the student on his overall breadth and depth in his major area. c. On receiving the written examination, the student submits written answers to the questions (and possibly a revised dissertation proposal, if so requested) to all members of the Advisory Committee. d. The Advisory Committee evaluates the written portion including the dissertation proposal. If, based on the written portion, the Advisory Committee members see no possibility for a satisfactory overall performance on the Candidacy Examination, the Advisory Committee records an \"unsatisfactory\" on the Candidacy Examination report form and returns it to the Graduate School. 4.4.2 Oral Examination: The oral candidacy examination shall last approximately two hours. In addition, a 30-45 minute presentation on the proposed research must be made prior to the oral examination, but after the candidate has made their written proposal available to the committee. As per Graduate School rules, the two hour oral examination is strictly an examination and may not include a formal oral presentation of the dissertation proposal. During this oral examination, the student should be prepared to defend his or her dissertation proposal and to answer questions on a range of topics including the area of specialization and general fundamentals of computer science. Examinees may use prepared slides in answering questions about their proposal. A passing grade requires a unanimous vote of the examination committee. Notice of the time and place of both the oral portion of the Candidacy Examination and the presentation prior to that will be given to all faculty of the Department. 4.5 Reporting of Results The student is considered to have passed the Candidacy Examination only when the decision of the Examination Committee is unanimous. The student's performance is evaluated and reported to the Graduate School as \"satisfactory\" (implying admission to candidacy) or \"unsatisfactory\" (implying failure and denial of admission to candidacy). When a failure is reported, the student may be permitted to take a second examination if recommended by the Candidacy Examination Committee. No student will be permitted to take the Candidacy Examination more than twice. The advisor is also reminded that a copy of the report to the Graduate School must be sent to the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for the Departmental record and student file. Reading Committee and Final Examination for Dissertation single-arrow-square After a student has passed the Candidacy Examination, the advisor of the student will nominate a Dissertation Committee to consider the merit of the dissertation. The members of the Dissertation Committee should be kept informed of the progress of research, thus giving them opportunities to make constructive suggestions for improvement of the dissertation. The Dissertation Committee will consist of the advisor and two other members of the Graduate Faculty approved by the Graduate Studies Committee for this function. Normally, the Dissertation Committee must be approved no later than in one semester in advance of the anticipated graduation date. It is suggested that the Dissertation Committee be chosen from the committee which administered the Candidacy Examination. The Graduate School should be consulted on the various deadlines for submission of the dissertation as well as for regulations governing the mechanics of its preparation. The Graduate School is to be informed of the Dissertation Committee members and the subject of the dissertation in the semester of expected graduation. The Final Oral Examination is held after the approval of the draft of the dissertation by the Dissertation Committee. Generally, the Dissertation Committee and a Graduate School representative will constitute the Final Oral Examination Committee. The examination will be oral and will deal intensively with the portion of the candidate's field of specialization, though it need not be confined exclusively to the subject matter of the student's dissertation. A unanimous vote of the Final Oral Examination Committee is required for the student to pass. It is expected that the dissertation be made available, and an announcement of the examination be made, at least one week in advance of the Final Oral Examination. The examination is open to the general public. Non-committee members should be permitted to ask questions. It is expected that the Chair of the Committee will control the ordering and kind of questions asked to ensure fairness and reasonable progress of the examination and to ensure that members of the Examination Committee have sufficient opportunity to question the candidate. The Direct PhD Track single-arrow-square Students intending to pursue study towards a Ph.D. may apply directly to the Direct Ph.D. track. In the Direct Ph.D. track, students focus on research and study in selected areas of concentration from the beginning of their graduate studies, thereby facilitating more rapid progress towards the degree. n addition to the standard requirements of the Ph.D. program, as detailed earlier, Direct Ph.D. students are required to satisfy the following progress requirements: Complete all the core courses during the first year of study and either qualify through the acceleration option, or appear for the Qualifying Examination by the first semester of the second year in the program. Students unable to meet this requirement should petition in advance to the graduate studies chair, with support of their advisor. Take at least 3 research cr-hrs in the form of independent study, research seminars (\"Advanced Topics in ...\"), or thesis research every semester, commencing from their second semester. Identify their research advisor and the major/minor areas of study by the end of the Spring semester of their first year (or their second semester, if they enter the Direct Ph.D. track in a different term). Students may change research advisor or major/minor areas, with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. Students in the Direct Ph.D. track can obtain a Masters automatically by passing the Ph.D. Candidacy Examination. A student in the Direct Ph.D. track is not eligible to take the Department's Masters Comprehensive Examination or to apply for a Masters by writing and defending a Masters thesis. However, a student who is unable to make adequate progress in the Direct Ph.D. track after two years in the program may petition the Graduate Studies Committee to transfer to the Research (Thesis) Track of the Masters program.",

In order to conduct state-of-the-art research in nearly any discipline, students now must contribute to, or even design and develop by themselves, sophisticated discipline-specific software systems. Moreover, looking at problems through the lens of \"computational thinking\" can bring new insights even when discipline-specific software is not involved. The Graduate Minor in Computer Science is designed to provide such knowledge and skill.

Due to limited availability, we consider applicants for associateships only if they are interested in pursuing a Ph.D., which they should communicate by marking 'Ph.D. only' track on the application. Similarly, the department recommends applicants to the graduate school for fellowships only if they mark 'Ph.D. only' track on their application. Once fellowship or associateship offers are made and availed, this track option cannot be changed. Associateships require approximately 20 hours per week in service to the department and allow a student to pursue approximately two thirds of a full-time academic schedule. Fellowships allow a student to pursue a full-time academic schedule. Fellowships include summer support. Students with Teaching Associateships are offered summer support, subject to availability. Numerous Teaching and Research Associateships are provided each year by the department and, normally, TA offers are made only for Autumn Semester. Applicants to the graduate program who wish to be considered for an Associateship or Fellowship should indicate this in the appropriate section of the application form. Students whose native language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in spoken English. Without such a demonstration, students may reduce their chances of getting Associateships and the awards could be smaller.

    "text_content": "Enrollment Limits | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Enrollment Limits Enrollment Limits During the last several years, the number of students interested in becoming majors in the programs offered in the department has steadily gone up with the result that the number of majors admitted to the CSE and CIS programs current substantially exceeds our capacity, given our faculty size. In order to ensure that students admitted to the CSE or CIS majors are not closed out of required and elective CSE courses, and that they are able to graduate in a timely fashion, the department will once again institute enrollment limits, limiting the number of students admitted each year to the majors. This limit is imposed via a GPA-based mechanism, approved by the university. Enrollment in the major programs : Briefly, the mechanism for admitting students into any of the major programs in the department works as follows: Each year a faculty committee (the Undergraduate Studies Committee) determines the GPA cutoff for next year, on the basis of current and projected demand, and the expected resource availability (mainly tenure-track faculty size), using a university-approved formula. Students who wish to be admitted to any of the major programs in the department must meet the current GPA requirement. The precise numerical GPA-requirement, as well as specific course requirements, for admission to the majors are specified in the \"prerequisites\" list under the individual majors. Students who do not meet the GPA (or other) requirements are not admitted to the major. In the interest of fairness to all students, it is not possible to make exceptions for individual students who do not meet one or more of the requirements for admission to the majors. Current GPA requirement for admission to the CSE and CIS majors programs : As of Summer 2015, students who have a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or above and have completed the prerequisite courses are admitted to the major following the procedures described in the \"admission to the major\" page. The GPA requirement will be adjusted each year, based on the demand for the majors and the faculty strength. (For comparison, this document describes the GPA requirements for various majors in the College of Engineering. Note also that although the BS-CIS and BA-CIS are in Arts and Sciences (not Engineering), the admission procedures and conditions are the same as for BS-CSE.) Enrollment in CSE courses : First preference for enrollment in CSE courses higher than 2221 is given to majors. Once the demand for seats from current majors is satisfied, any remaining seats still available in the course becomes available to non-major students. Occasionally, the demand from majors is so great as to exceed the number of seats in the course. In that case, even majors might be closed out of the course; this is a rare occurrence and the department tries to schedule sufficient numbers of sections of various courses to minimize this. One important point to note is that the Advising Office cannot make special exceptions for any non-majors and admit them into closed courses.

OSU Students Currently Pursuing Other Majors : OSU students who are currently pursuing other (undergraduate) majors and are interested in transferring to one of the majors in the department are required to follow the same procedures, and meet the same conditions for admission to the major, as students who are not currently in any other major. In particular, these students must take the pre-requisite courses and meet the applicable GPA requirement before applying for admission to one of the majors; please consult the earlier sections of this brochure for information on these requirements. Note in particular that the GPA that is used to determine whether the student meets the current GPA requirement will be over all the courses taken at OSU. Students who are currently in a graduate program in another major at OSU cannot simultaneously pursue an undergraduate degree in the department. If you are a graduate student and interested in computing, please consult the brochure on Graduate Study for possible options that may be available to you. Students Considering Transferring to OSU: Students who are currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in another university and interested in transferring to OSU to pursue one of the majors in the department have to be first admitted to OSU. If you are such a student, you should contact the Ohio State University Admissions Office for information on how to apply for admission to the university. In other words, if you are currently a student at some other university and wish to transfer to the Ohio State University, you must first go through the Admissions Office and be admitted to the university. The CSE department is not directly involved with admitting students to Ohio State. You should also read the earlier sections of this brochure that describe the various majors and the requirements for admission to major status. Please note that admission to OSU does not guarantee that you will be admitted to a major program in the department . Instead, if you are admitted to OSU, you will be admitted as a pre-major (for example, pre-CIS or pre-CSE). Once you meet all the requirements for admission to the major, including the applicable GPA requirement, you may apply for admission to the major. The GPA that will be used for this purpose will only be over courses taken at OSU, not the GPA from your previous school.

    "text_content": "Important Information for Majors | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Important Information for Majors Important Information for Majors (This page contains information relevant to majors in the department that did not fit anywhere else.) Registration in courses : All registration for courses is done via the Registrar's on-line registration system. Timely registration for courses each quarter is the individual student's responsibility. Students who are CSE/CIS majors are given priority in registration; once their registration requests have been fulfilled, students who are minors in CIS are registered, followed by all other students. However, the department still wants to be involved in assisting the majors in planning a schedule of courses from the point of becoming a major until graduation. Consequently, all students are encouraged to file an academic plan with the Advising Office within one term of becoming a major. Placement, Co-ops, & Internships : Your college Career Services office is a valuable resource to help you reach your career goals. Whether you are an undergraduate just beginning to explore your options through co-op or internship experience, or an undergraduate or graduate student anticipating the transition to full-time career employment, you will want to take full advantage of these services. Each career services office provides: career information (including salary statistics); information about potential employers; a variety of workshops and individual appointments to help with job search issues (interviewing skills, resume writing, etc); full time career, co-op, internships, summer, and part-time postings; and resume referral services. Each Career Services office provides convenient web-based services to help registered students link with potential employers. In addition, opportunities abound to meet with employers here on campus, both through career fairs and on-campus interviewing coordinated by each College. Ohio State's reputation for academic excellence means that many nationally known employers travel to campus to recruit our students. Placement (post-graduation): To take full advantage of all of the services and opportunities provided, you should plan to register with your College Career Services office at least three quarters prior to graduation. (If you have previously registered as an intern or co-op candidate, then you need to update your registration to participate in full-time employment services.) Campus recruiting is seasonal; the majority of campus recruiting takes place between October and March. Career fairs take place on campus throughout the academic year. Co-ops and Internships: Undergraduate students seeking practical, well-paid career-related work experience should start with their College Career Services office. Cooperative education (co-op) students alternate quarter of full-time work and full-time classes, usually maintaining a continuing commitment to the same employer throughout their undergraduate degrees. Internship students may work full-time for a single quarter or two back-to-back quarters before returning to full-time studies. Part-time employment in computing-related positions is also available with many central Ohio employers, including Ohio State. The Career Services offices co-sponsor and Internship/Co-op Job Fair each April. Typically, employers give first priority when hiring full-time employees to their own co-ops and interns, since both students and employers have had the opportunity for a \"test drive.\" Of course, when it comes to hiring college graduates, employers generally favor those with career-related experience, so students are strongly encouraged to participate in these programs. Requirements for participation vary from college to college. Please contact your college's Career Services office for details. Utilizing Career Services: Students should register with the Career Services office serving their college of enrollment. To find out about the full range of services offered by each office and to learn about specific registration procedures, please check out the web site of the office which applies to you: Engineering Career Services Arts & Sciences Career Services Support CSE $50,000 for the 50th Donate to the department to help us reach the goal of $50,000 in donations to celebrate over 50 years of teaching excellence Click here to make your donation.

    "text_content": "Faculty Advisors | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Faculty Advisors Faculty Advisors Upon being accepted to the major, students will be assigned a faculty advisor. Students are urged to consult with their faculty advisor for information on choosing suitable technical elective courses based on their career goals. This is especially important if the student is interested in taking an unusual combination of elective courses. Additionally, faculty advisors can be helpful in choosing graduate schools or providing information about industry. When applying for graduation, both CSE and CIS majors will need to meet with their faculty advisors since the advisor's signature is needed on the graduation application. Some students never meet their advisors until they are ready apply for graduation and need the advisor's signature. This may be alright in the case of students who know, for example, exactly which particular elective courses they wish to take and have carefully checked that their choices meet all the requirements of their program. But even such students would benefit by occasionally consulting with their faculty advisor since the advisor might be able to identify alternate elective courses that might be worth considering. In any case, students should not wait until the last minute to approach their faculty advisors for signatures on their graduation application. If they do so, they run the risk, if the advisor in question is not immediately available, of missing the deadline for filing the application and having to postpone graduation. Students who do not know who their faculty advisor is, can get that information from the Advising Office . Students should also note that administrative functions (such as course adds and drops) are not performed by faculty advisors. These functions are performed by the Advising Office for both majors and pre-majors.

    "text_content": "Graduate | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Prospective Students Graduate Graduate The mission of The Ohio State University Department of Computer Science and Engineering Graduate Program is to develop researchers, educators and practicing professionals with advanced skills in computing. Students can pursue either a Master's degree or Doctorate or both. Students intending to pursue a Ph.D. without first obtaining a Master's degree may apply to the Direct Ph.D. Track . The graduate program generally has about 200 students, of whom about 2/3 are Ph.D. students. The Doctoral Program The goal of the doctoral program is to prepare students to become leading researchers and educators, both in academia and in industry. Doctoral candidates take a set of courses in one major and two minor areas of concentration as well as completing a set of core courses. The minor areas can be from areas outside the department, such as psychology or mathematics. Under the guidance of a faculty member, doctoral candidates must produce significant, innovative research in some area of computer science and write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation. The Master's Program The Master's program is divided into two tracks, one a research track, requiring a Master's thesis on some original research, and the other a coursework track, with a larger coursework requirement and a written Master's comprehensive examination. The objective of the research track is to provide students with advanced level knowledge in computing while developing their ability to do independent, creative research. The coursework track's objective is to provide advanced level knowledge and skills that will be valuable for practicing professionals. Both tracks give students a solid background in the theory and foundations of computing and expose them to the latest technology and ideas in computer science. Research The Computer Science and Engineering Department has research expenditures of over $6 million per year. The distinguished faculty includes ACM, IEEE, AAAI, and ABET Fellows, and editors and committee members on the boards of numerous journals and conferences.

    "text_content": "Rules & Policies | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Computing Labs Rules & Policies Rules & Policies The primary purpose of the labs is to support the educational process. Accordingly, all users are expected to conduct themselves in a mature and professional manner and abide by the following rules at all times. Users who fail to do so may have their accounts locked. OSU Office of Technology and Digital Innovation Policy on Responsible Use of University Computing and Network Resources Food & Drink Food and drink are not permitted in the labs at any time. Game Playing & Recreational Computing Workstations may not be used exclusively for game playing or recreational computing (Facebook, etc.) when the lab is more than half full. CSE Operators and Consultants have the authority to ask users who are monopolizing workstations for recreational purposes to stop and surrender their workstation if they have no other work to do. Account Security Per department policy: \"A [CSE] Computer account is to be used by the individual assigned to it and by no one else. \" Under no circumstances should any user ever reveal their password or share their account with another user. If a user suspects their account is compromised for any reason, the user is required to change their password immediately . Locking Workstations Users are permitted to and should lock their workstations if they need to step away for a short time. Users who will be away from their workstation for more than 15 minutes should log out of their workstation. Workstations that are left locked for more than 15 minutes will be logged out, and any unsaved data will be lost. Displaying Inappropriate or Offensive Content Computers in public labs are the property of the University and considered part of the workplace. Content displayed should be appropriate to maintaining a supportive, friendly work environment. Any user who finds the display of any content inappropriate should open a ticket via the ETS service portal noting date, time, system on which the content was observed, the nature of the content, and any information known about the person displaying the content. Printer Usage Users are permitted a maximum of 3 print jobs in any print queue at any time. Users should not print multiple copies of the same document. Large or graphically intensive print jobs should be printed only when the load on the printer is low. Violation of any of these policies may result in the removal of the offending print job from the queue. Compute-intensive applications So that all users have equal opportunity to access the CSE computing environment, user processes are monitored by the CSE computing staff. Large processes (defined as processes that use 25% or more of the total CPU resources on a given server for an extended period of time), processes left running for more than 12 hours and processes left running while the user is not logged in will be killed. Users who need to run a compute-intensive program should use the nice command to run their process at a lower priority; see man nice for more details.

Benefits of joining the NEWPATH program : NEWPATH is undoubtedly a demanding program, as will be clear by comparing the bingo sheets below. Nevertheless, students with an interest in IT entrepreneurship should seriously consider joining the program since it will not only help them develop essential entrepreneurship skills, it will also give them experience, via the internships, in working for IT startups; and will give them actual experience, via the e-practicum, in planning, trying to acquire funding, and setting up and running their own ventures. Throughout the period that the student is in the NEWPATH program, he or she will have designated faculty advisors from both the CSE Dept. and the Fisher College of Business assigned; in addition, the student will also be assigned to an experienced member of the industry who will serve as a mentor. Plus, subject to making satisfactory progress, NEWPATH students will be eligible for special scholarships. Joining NEWPATH : Students will typically join the NEWPATH program near the end of their freshman year or early in the sophomore year. It is, however, possible for highly motivated students to join and succeed in the program as late as in their junior year. If you are in your late sophomore year or even junior year and are interested in a program that will develop your entrepreneurial abilities talk to one of the NEWPATH faculty listed and we will work with you to develop a program tailored to your individual situation.

    "text_content": "Entrepreneurship Research (E-Research) for NEWPATH Students | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Enrichment Programs Entrepreneurship Research (E-Research) for NEWPATH Students Entrepreneurship Research (E-Research) for NEWPATH Students One of the key elements of the NEWPATH program is the training in entrepreneurial principles and practices that it provides to students. Based on our initial two years of experience in the program, we are introducing an additional component to this training. This component will consist of students in the program researching various topics related to IT-entrepreneurship and writing papers reporting results of their research. The best of these papers will be collected and made available to all students in the program. The e-research component will be structured as follows. Near the end of each quarter, students in the program may apply to participate in e-research during the next quarter. The student has to identify a particular topic related to IT-entrepreneurship that would be suitable for such research. During the quarter in which the student engages in the research and writing the paper, he or she will be eligible to receive financial support of $10 per hour for work of up to five hours per week; this support for undergraduate research will come from NSF funds that have been reserved for supporting students in the program. In practice, it is expected that the student will probably spend more than five hours on the work in some weeks and less than five in other weeks. The student must sign up as an undergraduate student employee and fill out the timesheet each week reporting on the (approximate) number of hours worked during that week. The number of hours reported for each week can vary within reason and as long as the total for the quarter does not exceed 50 hours (averaging 5 hours per week). Students should also note that hours cannot be \"carried forward\" to future quarters. A student coordinator, one of the NEWPATH students, will be appointed each quarter to coordinate this activity and ensuring that students are making progress toward completing their papers. Any NEWPATH student who wants become e-research coordinator should contact Prof. David Lee. The NEWPATH faculty are in the process of developing a suitable rubric for the evaluation of papers that students write as part of this program. The purpose of the evaluation is three-fold. First, it will give useful feedback to individual students on the quality of their work, its strengths as well as possible suggestions for improvements. Second, it will help NEWPATH faculty determine whether the student's funding for undergradute research should be continued for future quarters. Third, the faculty intend to create an (on-line) binder containing the best papers as a valuable resource for students in the program and the evaluation will help determine which papers to include in the binder. Selected presentations and papers ; (and a much older version ). Support for participation in conferences etc. : In order to further help students develop their entrepreneurial skills, the program will fund any NEWPATH student who is actively participating in NEWPATH up to $1500 to attend a conference related to IT-entrepreneurship or other entrepreneurship-related activity in which the student has an active role (presenting a paper, demo'ing a system etc.), subject to approval by NEWPATH faculty. Students who want to receive such support should contact Prof. Lee in a timely manner to allow for consideration of their request.

The most ambitious students are expected, by the time of graduation, to be running their own IT startups and be ready to become the next generation of business and technology leaders of the IT world. Intended Outcomes: The intended outcomes of the NEWPATH program are: To provide a thorough education in computing fundamentals as well as in the most promising ideas and technologies that are likely to form the core of small and large IT businesses of the future; To help students in the program develop, via the Entrepreneurship Minor program, a thorough understanding of essential issues and ideas related to creating, launching and running successful IT ventures; To help students develop and hone their entrepreneurship skills by providing suitable internship opportunities in IT startups and other suitable IT companies in the Central Ohio area; To help students further develop their understanding of key principles of IT-entrepreneurship by providing a forum, in the form of a weekly seminar, where they can learn from each others' experiences and ideas and by interacting with local IT entrepreneurs; To provide students a realistic experience in planning, acquiring funding, and setting up and running an IT venture in a year-long e-practicum during the final year of the program; and To evaluate each aspect of the NEWPATH program to assess the efficacy of the various components and use the results of the assessments to continuously improve the program. NEWPATH Program: Major and pre-major students in BS CSE, BS CIS, and BS ECE (Computer option) programs with interests in entrepreneurship will be recruited into the program. In addition to satisfying the requirements of their respective majors, NEWPATH students will complete the entrepreneurship minor; complete two internships in carefully selected IT companies; complete the culminating e-practicum in which they will take an idea from concept to the brink of commercialization; and, in the case of the most promising cases, especially the ones that attract interest of potential investors when the business cases are presented to them as part of the e-practicum, to create and run the startups. Internships: Internships, especially in IT startups, is an important component of NEWPATH. TechColumbus' staff members will help place students in appropriate internship positions and will play a key role in assessing and guiding student teams in the e-practicum. Most importantly, TechColumbus will actively assist student teams in setting up and running the startups. Since startups may be strapped for cash, NSF-NEWPATH funds may be used, in such cases, to supplement or provide part of the salaries for students during their internship periods. Students who take up such internships, especially those whose internships are supported by NEWPATH funds, will be required to make a presentation, in the weekly seminar (see below) during the following quarter, about their internship experience. Internship supervisors of NEWPATH students whose internship was supported by NEWPATH funds will also be invited to make presentations in the weekly seminar; these presentations may be about their particular companies or may be on topics of general interest related to IT-entrepreneurship. Weekly Seminar: A key part of the program is the weekly seminar. All NEWPATH students, from freshmen to senior, are expected to register for and regularly attend the 1-credit hour NEWPATH weekly seminar every quarter (except Summer). The intent of the seminar is to provide a forum in which students can learn from each other and from NEWPATH faculty members, can brainstorm ideas that may serve as the basis for startups, can hear from other students about their internship and e-practicum experiences, can engage in case-studies of successful and unsuccessful IT startups to identify best (and not so good) practices, and can hear from CEOs and other senior people from local IT startups. Also, as described in the previous paragraph, NEWPATH students whose internships, or other program-related activities such as attending entrepreneurship-related conferences, have been funded by NEWPATH funds, are expected to make presentations in the seminar. In addition, students, either individually or in teams of two or three, are encouraged to pursue individual research where they explore, in depth, some aspect of entrepreneurship such as effective approaches to identifying market opportunities, or to obtaining venture capital, or even exploring specific items of recent technology developments that may present entrepreneurial opportunities. Students pursuing such research will be eligible for scholarship support of up to $500 per quarter. These students are required to make a presentation during the quarter, reporting on the results of their research findings; in addition, they are required to submit a (3-5 page) paper by the end of the quarter that reports on the findings and accounts for feedback received during their presentation. Students who do not seem to be making progress in their research or fail to make a presentation and/or submit a paper are likely to have their scholarships suspended and will be ineligible for scholarship support until they are again actively participating in and contributing to the program. The seminar will meet every semester (other than Summer) on Mondays at 10:20-11:15am in DL 263. [When OSU was on quarters, we used to meet on Tuesdays at 12:30-1:18pm.] We are currently in the process of having a regular course number assigned for the seminar; for now, students should register for 1-cr hour of Dr. Soundarajan's section of CSE 4193, \"Independent Studies\". Regular attendance at the seminar and active participation are key to achieving the program's outcomes. Hence, every student is expected to attend the seminar regularly and participate actively. Failure to do so without prior consultation with the NEWPATH faculty may result in the student being suspended from the program. In some cases, it is recognized that a student may not be able to participate in the seminar for part of or even an entire quarter. For example, if the student is required to take a particular course whose schedule conflicts with the Tuesday, 12:30-1:18 time slot of the NEWPATH seminar, or if the student has a summer internship that continues into fall and the internship duties prevent the student from attending the seminar; etc. In such cases, the student should inform, by email, the NEWPATH faculty in a timely manner, no later than by the end of the first week of the quarter in question. Failure to do so will render the student ineligible for scholarship support and support for internship-salary and other program related activities for the next two quarters. Repeated failure to attend the seminar and failure to participate actively will result in the student being dropped from the program. Evaluation: Evaluation is an integral part of the NEWPATH program. An external evaluator will work closely with the NEWPATH faculty to develop suitable rubrics for evaluating the program and its effectiveness in achieving its intended outcomes. The evaluation results will be used to identify and implement necessary improvements in the program. Other: NEWPATH is one of the projects supported by the NSF under its CPATH program. The site at http://www.cpath-community.msu.edu/projects/nteit contains links to all the CPATH projects (including NEWPATH). A brochure providing a high-level overview of NEWPATH, including the rationale underlying the development of the program is available.

Later meetings will be devoted to presentations by local IT entrepreneurs, students reporting on their internship/entrepreneurial experiences, and by faculty on a range of topics. Students will also present based on readings of appropriate books and papers on entrepreneurial topics. If you are a NEWPATH student and have not yet registered for the course, you should do so (unless you have a time conflict with another course). The call numbers for the CSE 693 is 04502-1 and for the ECE 293 is 10702-3. For complete details of the purpose of this \"course\", please see below under \"NEWPATH Curriculum\". Important local IT-entrepreneurship event (Su '08): The startup weekend , an event where a number of aspiring tech entrepreneurs, business owners, attorneys, designers, Web engineers and other business consultants came together for an intensive workshop was hosted by TechColumbus on July 18-20. For full details, see http://columbus.startupweekend.com/ and http://www.techcolumbus.org/en/art/?1098 . Important note for international students:: If you are an international student on an F-1 visa, it is important that you understand the INS requirements concerning internships etc. before you start your internship. Otherwise, you run the risk of violating the terms of your visa which can have serious consequences for your continued stay at OSU. If you are such a student, please make sure to read this summary information . You should also check with the Office of International Affairs (contact information in the summary information page).] NEWPATH Curriculum (Sp '08): At the last meeting (on March 27), one of the important questions that came up was, how do we ensure that NEWPATH students continue to pay attention to entrepreneurial issues and don't just focus on whatever regular courses they are currently taking? Based on the discussion at the meeting and further e-mail discussions, the NEWPATH team has decided to adopt the following approach: Each quarter, starting with Au '08, we will offer a \"course\" that will essentially consist of guest speakers and presentations by the students (on interesting technology-related or entrepreneurship-related topics). The course will meet once a week, on Friday afternoons (starting at 3:30), for about an hour-and-half. All NEWPATH students will be required to take this course. This course will be considered an \"independent study\" course (number: 693) with the individual student's major advisor. Each quarter (exept Summer), students in their sophomore or junior years will register for 1 credit hour each for the course. NEWPATH students who are CIS and CSE majors may, if they wish to do so, use upto two credit hours of this course as part of their technical electives; ECE majors should consult with their advisor. Students in their senior year will also be required to participate in the course. But they will not register for the 693. Instead, participation will be a required part of the 4th-year \"e-practicum\". Thus all students will participate in the course in their sophomore, junior, and senior years; this should help develop their entrepreneurship skills and also enable them to develop awareness of promising new technologies. Freshmen students in NEWPATH will also be required to take this course. Although they may not be able to (and will not be required to) make presentations etc., they will benefit from listening to industry experts and will be able to learn from the experiences of the senior students by interacting with them. Course of possible interest to NEWPATH students: A course titled, \"From Great Ideas to Great Products: Case Studies\" offered by the College of Engineering (taught by Dr. Phil Schlosser) may be of interest to NEWPATH students. The next offering of the course is expected to be in Au '08. Talks by entrepreneurs (Sp '08): Dr. Camp announced at the meeting of 3/27 that NEWPATH students are welcome to attend talks by local entreprenuers scheduled as part of his BUS MHR 390 class this quarter. The talks are in Room 105 Schoenbaum Hall at 12:30 on Thursdays. The following talks have been currently scheduled: April 10: \"Positioning great ideas: execution of a plan\"; speaker: Cameron Mitchell. May 8: \"Pitching your big idea\"; speaker: Carey Jenkins. May 22: \"There's gold in the brand\": speaker: Charles Penzone. If you plan to attend any of the talks, please e-mail a brief note to that effect to Dr. Camp ( camp.1@osu.edu ). Spring Quarter Meeting, March 27: Spring quarter's meeting of NEWPATH students and faculty will be on Thursday, March 27, 2008, at 5pm - 6:30pm in DL 263. Pizza and pop will be served. Hope everyone is able to attend. Interesting news item (Mar. 18, '08): Columbus ranked number 1 \"hotbed of tomorrow's technology\" . Internship applications: Internship applications forms are now available (.doc) ( .pdf ). The completed applications should be submitted to Prof. Lee no later than March 15. Winter '08 Quarter Meeting, Feb. 7: Winter quarter's meeting of NEWPATH students and faculty will be on Thursday, Feb. 7, at 4pm - 6pm in DL 263. Pizza and pop will be served. Hope everyone is able to attend. Information Session, Jan. 15, '08: The first information session about the NEWPATH program was held on Jan. 15. About 30 students attended the session. Just over 50% of those who attended the session have since applied for and been admitted to the program.

    "text_content": "Mentoring NEWPATH Students | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Enrichment Programs Mentoring NEWPATH Students Mentoring NEWPATH Students Each NEWPATH student, from the time of joining the program through completion of the e-practicum, will have assigned CSE faculty and business faculty to provide advice and mentoring. In addition, carefully selected members of the TechColumbus personnel as well as staff of its affiliate companies who are familiar with the NEWPATH program and its goals, will be assigned to mentor students in various issues related to successful entrepreneurship. These issues may range from understanding the day-to-day problems that a small entrepreneur faces to raising venture capital to networking with other entrepreneurs to learn not only from their successes but also from their failures. Every effort will be made to tap industry practitioners who may have served as supervisors of NEWPATH students during their internships to serve as mentors. These practitioners would have firsthand experience with the students and would have worked closely with them. Similarly, in the longer term, NEWPATH graduates who go on to establish successful IT ventures will be tapped to serve as mentors for NEWPATH students. Computing faculty who serve as advisors to NEWPATH students will primarily provide advice and guidance about technical computing topics. But since these faculty are part of the NEWPATH program, this advice will be tailored to help achieve the program's outcomes. For example, if a student seems to be interested in a technical idea that has the potential to serve as a core concept (or even an auxiliary one) for a marketable product or service, the student will be referred to the NEWPATH business faculty as well as appropriate TechColumbus and other industry mentors to help the student investigate this potential. Similarly, the NEWPATH business faculty who advise students in the program will work closely with computing faculty and industry mentors to help students understand both business opportunities and potential pitfalls. It is expected that this combination of computing faculty, business faculty and industry mentors working closely with NEWPATH students will help nurture entrepreneurship in these students and produce the next generation of IT entrepreneurs.

An essential component of this is the requirement that all students in the program complete the entrepreneurship minor offered by the Fisher College of Business . The entrepreneurship minor program is designed to be flexible to meet the needs of students of different backgrounds and with different interests. The minor program requires students to complete the following two courses: Bus MHR 2500 (3 cr. hrs), Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Modern Business ; Bus MHR 3510 (3 cr. hrs), New Venture Creation ; In addition, all students pursuing the minor are required to complete at least three other courses from a list of electives (specified at entrepreneurship minor web site ). NEWPATH students will find the following elective courses especially appropriate: Bus Finance 3290 (3 cr. hrs), Entrepreneurial Finance ; Bus Mktg & Log. 3241 (3 cr. hrs), Entrepreneurial Marketing ; Bus MHR 3520 (3 cr. hrs), Leading High Performance Ventures . Some of the NEWPATH faculty were instrumental in setting up the entrepreneurship minor program in the Fisher College; and are directly and extensively involved in several of the courses listed above. These faculty, along with the NEWPATH computing, faculty will serve as advisors/mentors for NEWPATH students. As OSU has recently switched to semesters, students who joined OSU when we were on quarters may have completed some of these courses or, rather, their equivalent, under quarters. That is perfectly reasonable. They should complete the remaining courses under semesters. (For reference, the equivalent quarter-courses were, BusMHR 290, BusMHR 490, BusFin 590, BusMktg&Log. 490, and BusMHR 590, corresponding respectively to Bus MHR 2500, Bus MHR 3510, Bus Fin 3290, Bus Mktg & Log. 3241, and Bus MHR 3520.)

    "text_content": "Entrepreneurship Training for NEWPATH Students: IT Internships | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Enrichment Programs Entrepreneurship Training for NEWPATH Students: IT Internships Entrepreneurship Training for NEWPATH Students: IT Internships [ Note: : If you are an international student on an F-1 visa, it is important that you understand the INS requirements concerning internships etc. before you start your internship. Otherwise, you run the risk of violating the terms of your visa which can have serious consequences for your continued stay at OSU. If you are such a student, please make sure to read this summary information . You should also check with the Office of International Affairs (contact information in the summary information page).] One of the key elements of the NEWPATH program is the training in entrepreneurial principles and practices that it provides to students. An essential component of this is the requirement that all students in the program complete two 3-month long part-time (50% time) internships (or, equivalently, a single 3-month long full-time internship). TechColumbus , an important partner of the NEWPATH team, will actively help place NEWPATH students in these internships. Given its broad range of activities during the last several years in supporting and nurturing IT startups, as well as its ties to larger IT organizations in the Central Ohio region, TechColumbus will be able to identify suitable internship opportunities for NEWPATH students. Typically, students will undertake the first of their two internships during the summer quarter at the end of their sophomore year. By this time, students should have completed several of the courses in the entrepreneurship minor as well as the initial portion of the computer science curriculum. They would also have completed Comm 321, the course on public speaking, and CSE 601, the course on social and ethical issues in computing. Thus, they will be well prepared to both contribute positively to the IT venture in which they serve as interns and also to learn and absorb important lessons from their experience. By the time of their second internship during the summer quarter at the end of their junior year, students should have completed the entrepreneurship minor program, all of the required computing courses, as well as the capstone design course. It is expected that at least some of these students will, possibly as a result of their capstone design projects, have some preliminary ideas that can form the core of an IT venture. Hence this internship, especially if it is in a startup, should help them develop a good understanding of the numerous problems that must be addressed and pitfalls avoided between a technically sound idea and a successful venture based on the idea. Further, the intense team-work that is a central part of the capstone design course means that some of these students would have identified and established close working relations with other students who can partner together in planning, designing, and running IT ventures. All of this should help prepare the students to be successful in the culminating e-practicum in the autumn and winter quarters of the senior year, followed, at least in the case of some of some of the student teams, by the actual creation and running of small IT ventures in the spring quarter and beyond. It should be stressed that supervisors of the interns, in the IT organizations in which NEWPATH students are placed in internships, will be fully aware of the program's objectives and expected outcomes. They will work closely with the students' faculty advisors and with the students' mentors from TechColumbus to ensure that the internships contribute effectively toward achieving NEWPATH's outcomes. During each internship, students will be paid an appropriate salary. IT startups of the kind that TechColumbus incubates and nurtures would be ideal organizations for NEWPATH students to intern at. But many of these, since they are yet to establish themselves, may be unable to pay (adequate) salaries to the interns. In such cases, NEWPATH will use NSF funds to provide or supplement these salaries. In the longer term, a continuing fund, with contributions from local IT industries including, especially successful ventures set up by NEWPATH graduates, will be used for this purpose. Evaluation is an important aspect of NEWPATH. The NEWPATH team is working on developing suitable ways to evaluate the effectiveness of the internship program. The NEWPATH faculty have developed two rubrics for this purpose. One of these is to be completed by the intern's immediate supervisor; this rubric evaluates both the student's preparation for doing the work as well as the quality of his or her work as an intern. The other rubric is to be completed by the student; this rubric evaluates the contribution that the internship made to the student's knowledge about IT-entrepreneurship and his or her skills essential in becoming an IT-entrepreneur. If you were on an internship during the past quarter, please have your immediate supervisor complete the following rubric (and click the \"submit\" button once the form has been completed): Supervisor's evaluation of NEWPATH student intern . Also please complete the following rubric, providing us an evaluation of your internship: NEWPATH student's evaluation of internship .

The culminating component of this training is the entrepreneurship practicum (e-practicum). This component is designed to provide an in-depth practical experience in IT entrepreneurship to NEWPATH students where they will have the opportunity to take an idea from concept to the brink of commercialization. The practicum will take place within the structure of a two-quarter course sequence. NEWPATH students will self-select into teams that will each coalesce around a common idea and interest. (A team could also have students from programs other than the NEWPATH majors.) Each team will be assigned an executive mentor and a proven entrepreneurial technology leader, who will coach the team from prototyping to product development and the commercialization process. These mentors will be drawn from TechColumbus personnel and staff of its affiliate companies, senior staff at The Ohio State University Office of Technology Licensing, executives from local industry (recruited by the Center for Entrepreneurship and Center for Enterprise Transformation and Innovation (CETI) ) and faculty with industry and entrepreneurial experiences. Some of these mentors may have served as supervisors of NEWPATH students during their internships. The focus of the first quarter of the practicum will be on ideation and validation. In this phase, teams will identify promising IT areas and sources of product concepts that are within the technical capability of the team to analyze, explore and create product concepts based on their acquired technologies. They will evaluate the concepts and prioritize them. Product definition and selection criteria may include market analysis for the market needs and size, competitors, commercialization strategies and profit margins, as well as development and technical risks. The goal is to identify the most realistic and feasible product concepts with the minimum time and resources. The teams will then undertake both a functional and a strategic assessment of their product concepts by answering a set of key questions adopted from new venture literature, using standard business evaluation tools. The teams are, at this point, are searching for fatal flaws . At the end of this phase, there is a formal decision point for the product concept; decision options include: reject altogether, gather further information, or move on to justification. The focus of the second quarter of the practicum is on justification and commercialization with the goal of developing a business proposition. Students from teams that decided, at the end of the first quarter, to reject the original product concepts that their respective teams had wanted to pursue will be expected to find and join other appropriate teams that decided to move on to justification. Students will spend much of their time interacting with potential customers, potential competitors and industry thought leaders as they validate their assertions about the commercial viability of their projects. As part of the business case, students will decide on how the business will be financed, will define an operating model for the business including a management plan, and will prepare a go-to-market strategy based on market and competition analysis. Essentially, the students are thinking through the process of setting up and running a startup. This phase culminates with the development of a business proposal, i.e. a selling document , for a startup business. The final exercise will be a full-scale presentation to potential investors. These investors will consist of representatives from the TechColumbus-managed First 50 Fund , as well as others. Should a pitch be accepted for funding, or if the NEWPATH team should simply decide to pursue the business plan on its own, it will not only be given the license to do so but will be provided any assistance it may need to create and run the venture in the months following the completion of the e-practicum. Thus genuine entrepreneurial activity from NEWPATH students is expected and will be encouraged to every extent possible. One question that came up in discussions was that of intellectual property (IP) and whether OSU would make any claims on ventures that NEWPATH students might create. The NEWPATH team has discussed this question with the OSU IP office and obtained their assurance that, given the nature of the NEWPATH program, OSU will not make such claims.

The key idea is not to focus on whether the company will succeed or not but to get the student to create a venture since it is widely recognized that experience with creating and running a company, even if it ultimately fails, contributes considerably to an individual's entrepreneurial abilities. This page lists companies that have been either created or are in the process of being created by NEWPATH students. O2 Insights : The product is to detect the oxygen content around a chronic wound. The oxygen reading will give wound care doctors information to determine the correct course of treatment. The product is applicable to any part of the body and on almost all types of chronic wounds. The business plan won the first prize in the Deloitte Fisher Business Plan Competition of OSU, including office space at the Tech Columbus for one year and other awards. Currently due to university policies with research technologies, the team cannot setup a C-Corp or LLC because of the equity issue. The involved students are in the process of negotiating with the IP/Tech Licensing department of OSU for the rights to the technology for starting a business. Hottest On Campus : This is a web-based business established in Spring 2010. The website enables students to find out who is the \"hottest\" on their campus in the most clear and objective way possible while taking great care to remain within the bounds of good taste. Future options include finding jobs for students, pushing events, and other outlets. Continued development is planned for the website, http://hottestoncampus.com . This business was established Zach Boerger and Joel Clark in Spring 2010. OSUTrade.com : This venture derives from a web-based idea developed in Spring 2010. It enables students to buy and sell (used) books online for better deals than any campus bookstores. Monetization will likely be from Amazon affiliate links. A prototype is set up and continued development is planned. The idea for this business ws developed by Haochi Chen in Spring of 2010. Functional Delights, LLC : This is an iPhone application company established in September of 2009. Currently it is in mid-development on a task-management application. Future applications are being explored. The company was established by Benjamin Gilbert and Ian Kono in September of 2009. Currently mid-development on a task-management application that may or may not be pushed to market. Future applications are being explored. The conceptualization, development, and implementation of all Functional Delights future products were completely independent of NEWPATH or other resources at The Ohio State University. RouteKi : RouteKi.com is a web-based company that attempts to integrate bus routing, event information, and other map data in one website. The name of the website is derived from the site's functionality: Route, because the site provides routing information, and Ki, because the website plans to take a wiki approach. The site plans on allowing users to post walking routes and edit map data in real time. Also there will be a section of the site that is devoted to events. This section of the site will allow users to post and browse events. The site will then route users to the events from the location of their choice. One of our goals is to get the university to post its events on the site. It is also planned to talk with various club presidents and local businesses to get them to post their events on the site. RouteKi is still in its design phase and a release date is yet to be set. Pete Koelsch came up with the idea for Routeki and established the company. Ben Gilbert's company ?

These students range from freshmen/sophomores through seniors in a variety of majors (BS-CSE, BS-CIS, BS-ECE, BS-BA (IS)). Most of these students are keen on working as interns in technology (especially IT) startups that will give them an opportunity to hone their entrepreneurial skills while contributing their technical knowledge and skills to solving problems for the company. Internships in other companies, for example more established/larger companies, or companies whose primary business is not IT but that have a strong IT component, would also be suitable for these students. The key requirement is that the company provide opportunities for the students' growth, especially in terms of their entrepreneurial abilities.

Consequently, only students who have demonstrated outstanding scholastic ability and research potential will be admitted to the academic and research program leading to the Doctorate. The program of study for the Ph. D. is to be developed by the student in close consultation with his/her academic advisor. Students are encouraged to work out their plan of study as soon as possible so that all requirements may be met. 1 Advisors Each student entering the graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is initially assigned a tentative academic advisor. Students' degree programs and all courses taken by students must be approved by their academic advisors. Students should consult their advisors as soon as possible after arriving on campus, and periodically thereafter until, upon developing a specific specialty interest, the student chooses a permanent advisor in that specialty area. This choice should be made as soon as practical. The assignment of students to research advisors is performed by mutual agreement of the student and faculty member. The intent of this explicit agreement is to make students aware of the importance of early interactions with faculty in topic areas of mutual interest. Students are free to change their advisors when mutual research interests change. A \"Change of Advisor\" form is available in the CSE Office. The Graduate School rules require that advisors for students in the Ph.D. program be Category P Graduate Faculty members, but it is permissible to have a Category M Graduate Faculty member as a co-advisor. The co-advisor may be the functioning advisor. In such cases, a Category P person should be included as an integral member of the research team early in the student's research, so there is a meaningful collaboration involving the Category M functioning advisor and the Category P advisor. The Graduate School requires that the Category P advisor sign the examination and thesis approval forms. 2 Stages of Study The requirements for a Doctoral degree in Computer Science and Engineering are determined in part by general Graduate School requirements for a Ph.D. degree, and in part by specific requirements stipulated by the department. The student should refer to the Graduate School Handbook for residency requirements, regulations concerning transfer of credit from other institutions, and for credit-hour requirements stipulated by the Graduate School. 2.1 Preliminary Requirement: Prior to entering the first stage of study toward the Doctoral degree, a student has to successfully complete the Ph.D qualifying examination (see Section 3). 2.2 First Stage: During the first stage of Ph.D. study, the student is required to undertake a program of study in a major area and two minor areas, and to formulate a dissertation proposal. Fifteen credits of coursework in the major area and nine credits in each of the minor areas are required. This coursework cannot include core or pre-core classes, and these credits also need to be from graded graduate classes, with the exception of a total of 3 credits of 793/888 across the two minor areas. The student's research advisor serves as the advisor for the program of study in the major area. The student, in consultation with the research advisor, chooses the two minor areas of study and the minor area advisors. The courses comprising the program of study for the minor areas must be approved by the minor area advisors. The first stage of study toward a Doctoral degree is completed when the student has received credit for a total of 90 quarter hours of graduate work in a program prescribed by the student's advisor and has passed the Candidacy Examination (see Section 5) to be formally admitted to candidacy. At least six months prior to taking the Candidacy Examination, a proposed schedule of study should be submitted to the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for consideration. 2.3 Second Stage: The second stage is devoted primarily to research and seminars, the preparation of the dissertation, and the Final Examination (see Section 6). The Final Examination is oral and deals intensively with the portion of the candidate's field of specialization in which the dissertation falls, though it need not be confined exclusively to the subject matter of the dissertation. 3 The Qualifying Examination The Qualifying Examination is administered Autumn and Spring quarters. Satisfactory performance on this examination, or qualification through the acceleration option listed below, is necessary for admission to the first stage of study towards the Doctoral degree. The Qualifying Examination is based on the material covered in the graduate core areas, namely, analysis of algorithms, computability and unsolvability, programming languages, operating systems, and computer architecture. Students who have previously studied this material are not required to take the corresponding core courses(s) in the CSE Department; they need only demonstrate their competence in these areas by satisfactory performance on the Qualifying Examination. At the time students take the examination, they must have been admitted to the CSE Department and not be on probation. A student whose enrollment eligibility has been deactivated by the Graduate School may, if subsequently reactivated, be required to re-take the Qualifying Examination. A student who fails the qualifying examination for the first time must retake the examination the next quarter that it is offered. Students must petition the Graduate Studies Committee to retake the examination in any other quarter or to retake the examination more than once. Acceleration Option for Qualifying Exams: Students who have completed the 5 core classes in their first 3 academic-year quarters with a GPA of 3.6 or better will be automatically granted a 'conditional pass' in the qualifying examination. Theses students will need to demonstrate substantial research progress during their second year spring evaluation to remove the condition. One clear mechanism for demonstrating such progress is to have an accepted or submitted paper as a significant contributor, working on a project with their advisor. 4 The Candidacy Examination This section further specifies the procedure set forth for the Candidacy Examination in Section I of the Graduate School Handbook. That section must be read in conjunction with this document for a full understanding of the rules governing the Candidacy Examination. The Candidacy Examination is a very important means by which the faculty can ensure that the prospective student has the necessary breadth and depth in chosen areas within computer and information science and cognate areas. The student is expected to demonstrate superior knowledge in his or her chosen areas. To be eligible for the Candidacy Examination, the student is required to select one major area and two minor areas. The student may choose any of the pre-defined major or minor areas specified in the \"Guidelines for the Ph.D. Candidacy Exam Major/Minor Areas\". To demonstrate mastery in the two minor areas, the student is required to obtain a GPA of 3.3 or higher in the letter-graded courses taken in each of two minor areas. To demonstrate mastery in the major area, the student is expected to prepare a dissertation proposal. The student and the student's major advisor may suggest two examiners who are competent in the student's major area. In the Candidacy Examination, the student will be examined in written and oral format over the major area and the dissertation proposal. 4.1 Proposed Schedule of Study The student is required to submit to the Graduate Studies Committee a proposed schedule of study for the candidacy examination at least six months in advance of the examination. The schedule should include the choice of major and minor areas, counter-signed by the student's major and two minor advisors, and the student's preliminary dissertation proposal, counter-signed by the student's major advisor and two other faculty members who will serve on the Candidacy Examination Committee. The schedule must also indicate those courses and individual studies already accomplished in each of the major and minor areas, together with additional work planned at this time. The Graduate School must be notified before the written portion of the Candidacy Examination begins. 4.2 Declaration of Intent to Take the Candidacy Examination After the student's proposed schedule of study has been approved by the Graduate Studies Committee, the Candidacy Examination should be scheduled in consultation with the examination committee. At least one month prior to the scheduled oral examination date, the student should declare formally the intent to take the oral portion of the Candidacy Examination. This Declaration of Intent form must be signed by the student's major advisor and the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee before transmittal to the Dean of the Graduate School for approval, and for appointment of the Graduate School Representative to the Examination Committee. 4.3 The Candidacy Examination Committee The Examination Committee consists of the Advisory Committee and a graduate school representative appointed by the Graduate School. The Advisory Committee consists of at least four faculty members, including the student's major advisor, two other members of the Graduate Faculty approved by the Graduate Studies Committee for this function, and a departmental representative appointed by the Graduate Studies Committee. 4.4 Examination Format The Candidacy Examination consists of two parts, namely, a written examination and an oral examination. The precise times and places of the administration of the Examination will be determined by the Examination Committee, but the entire Examination must be administered within a three-month period. 4.4.1 Written Examination: The written portion is administered and evaluated by the student's Advisory Committee. It is conducted in the following steps. a. The student prepares a written dissertation proposal. The proposal should be concise and precise, and should include the following: Title and abstract Significance of the problem Scope and objectives of the research Methodology Expected results and conclusions Expected contributions to the state of art/literature Students are encouraged to include in the written portion any preliminary results that support the dissertation proposal. The dissertation proposal must be submitted to all members of the Advisory Committee. b. On receiving the dissertation proposal, the major advisor compiles a written examination for the student, taking into consideration questions posed by and comments received from the rest of the Advisory Committee. The written examination consists of two parts. The first part asks questions related to the submitted dissertation proposal. The purpose of this part is to examine whether the dissertation proposal has substantial depth to lead to quality research and whether the student is well prepared to conduct the research outlined in the proposal. The student may be asked to revise the proposal in accordance with the suggestions received. The second part examines the student on his overall breadth and depth in his major area. c. On receiving the written examination, the student submits written answers to the questions (and possibly a revised dissertation proposal, if so requested) to all members of the Advisory Committee. d. The Advisory Committee evaluates the written portion including the dissertation proposal. If, based on the written portion, the Advisory Committee members see no possibility for a satisfactory overall performance on the Candidacy Examination, the Advisory Committee records an \"unsatisfactory\" on the Candidacy Examination report form and returns it to the Graduate School. 4.4.2 Oral Examination: The oral candidacy examination shall last approximately two hours. In addition, a 30-45 minute presentation on the proposed research must be made prior to the oral examination, but after the candidate has made their written proposal available to the committee. As per Graduate School rules, the two hour oral examination is strictly an examination and may not include a formal oral presentation of the dissertation proposal. During this oral examination, the student should be prepared to defend his or her dissertation proposal and to answer questions on a range of topics including the area of specialization and general fundamentals of computer science. Examinees may use prepared slides in answering questions about their proposal. A passing grade requires a unanimous vote of the examination committee. Notice of the time and place of both the oral portion of the Candidacy Examination and the presentation prior to that will be given to all faculty of the Department. 4.5 Reporting of Results The student is considered to have passed the Candidacy Examination only when the decision of the Examination Committee is unanimous. The student's performance is evaluated and reported to the Graduate School as \"satisfactory\" (implying admission to candidacy) or \"unsatisfactory\" (implying failure and denial of admission to candidacy). When a failure is reported, the student may be permitted to take a second examination if recommended by the Candidacy Examination Committee. No student will be permitted to take the Candidacy Examination more than twice. The advisor is also reminded that a copy of the report to the Graduate School must be sent to the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for the Departmental record and student file. 5 Reading Committee and Final Examination for Dissertation After a student has passed the Candidacy Examination, the advisor of the student will nominate a Dissertation Committee to consider the merit of the dissertation. The members of the Dissertation Committee should be kept informed of the progress of research, thus giving them opportunities to make constructive suggestions for improvement of the dissertation. The Dissertation Committee will consist of the advisor and two other members of the Graduate Faculty approved by the Graduate Studies Committee for this function. Normally, the Dissertation Committee must be approved no later than two quarters in advance of the anticipated graduation date. It is suggested that the Dissertation Committee be chosen from the committee which administered the Candidacy Examination. The Graduate School should be consulted on the various deadlines for submission of the dissertation as well as for regulations governing the mechanics of its preparation. The Graduate School is to be informed of the Dissertation Committee members and the subject of the dissertation in the quarter of expected graduation. The Final Oral Examination is held after the approval of the draft of the dissertation by the Dissertation Committee. Generally, the Dissertation Committee and a Graduate School representative will constitute the Final Oral Examination Committee. The examination will be oral and will deal intensively with the portion of the candidate's field of specialization, though it need not be confined exclusively to the subject matter of the student's dissertation. A unanimous vote of the Final Oral Examination Committee is required for the student to pass. It is expected that the dissertation be made available, and an announcement of the examination be made, at least one week in advance of the Final Oral Examination. The examination is open to the general public. Non-committee members should be permitted to ask questions. It is expected that the Chair of the Committee will control the ordering and kind of questions asked to ensure fairness and reasonable progress of the examination and to ensure that members of the Examination Committee have sufficient opportunity to question the candidate. 6 The Direct Ph. D. Track Students intending to pursue study towards a Ph.D. may apply directly to the Direct Ph.D. track. In the Direct Ph.D. track, students focus on research and study in selected areas of concentration from the beginning of their graduate studies, thereby facilitating more rapid progress towards the degree. In addition to the standard requirements of the Ph.D. program, as detailed earlier, Direct Ph.D. students are required to satisfy the following progress requirements: Take at least 12 credits each quarter, commencing from the second quarter. Complete all the core courses during the first year of study and either qualify through the acceleration option, or appear for the Qualifying Examination by the first quarter of the second year in the program. Students unable to meet this requirement should petition in advance to the graduate studies chair, with support of their advisor. Take at least three research credits in the form of independent study (793), research seminars (788/888) or thesis research (999) every quarter, commencing from their second quarter. Identify their research advisor and the major/minor areas of study by the end of the Spring quarter of their first year (or their third quarter, if they enter the Direct Ph.D. track in a different quarter). Students may change research advisor or major/minor areas, with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. Complete at least 3 courses from the major/minor areas and file a tentative plan of coursework in the major/minor areas by the end of the third quarter in the program. The study plan must be endorsed by the research advisor. Students in the Direct-PhD track can obtain a Masters automatically by passing the Ph.D. Candidacy Examination. A student in the Direct Ph.D. track is not eligible to take the Department's Masters Comprehensive Examination or to apply for a Masters by writing and defending a Masters thesis. However, a student who is unable to make adequate progress in the Direct Ph.D. track after two years in the program may petition the Graduate Studies Committee to transfer to the Research (Thesis) Track of the Masters program.

These requirements and the procedures for obtaining the degree are determined in part by the Graduate School, and in part by the Department. Petitions for exception to these requirements should be channeled through the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. Students in the M.S. program must be regular students as defined by the Graduate School regulations; special students and students enrolled in Continuing Education are not considered as regular students. In order to qualify for admission as regular students, students must first remove any restrictions placed on their status. Removal of restrictions is regulated by the Graduate School and the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee. The procedures and requirements described herein are subject to revision. Students should consult materials issued periodically by the Graduate School and the Department, their advisors, or the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for any changes or interpretation of policy. Program for the Master of Science Degree in CSE The program's philosophy is to provide students a broad graduate level education in the fundamentals of Computer Science and Engineering and also provide the opportunity for deeper study in a specialized sub-area of interest to the student. Students work out the details of their program in close consultation with their advisors. Two options are offered: Thesis Option (Research Track) Non-Thesis Option (Coursework Track) Program requirements for the Thesis Option and Non-Thesis Option are detailed in this document. The terms \"Research Track\" and \"Thesis Option\" are used interchangeably in this document. Similarly, the terms \"Coursework Track\" and \"Non-Thesis Option\" are used synonymously. 1 Advisors Students' degree programs and all courses taken by students must be approved by their academic advisors. Each student admitted to the graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is assigned a tentative academic advisor. Students should consult their advisors as soon as possible after arriving on campus, and periodically thereafter until, upon developing a specific specialty interest, a permanent advisor is chosen in that specialty area. When a student determines that his/her interests lie in a particular specialty area, he/she should choose a permanent faculty advisor in that area. This choice should be made as soon as practical, especially for students planning either to undertake thesis research or to enter the Ph.D. program. Students whose specialty interests change should consider changing to an advisor whose field encompasses their new interests. In exceptional cases, members of other departments who hold joint appointments as Graduate Faculty members of this Department may serve as research advisors for students, but in all cases, the student's academic advisor must be a faculty member whose primary faculty appointment is in this Department. In addition to the above departmental academic and research advising, the Graduate School maintains a counseling office for students. 2 Requirements for the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Engineering This section contains a list of requirements for the Master of Science Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Students are advised to check the latest edition of the Graduate School Handbook for possible added requirements. 2.1 Credit Hours The minimum number of quarter credit hours required for the M.S. Degree is as follows: Research Track (Requires Thesis): 45 credits Coursework Track (No thesis): 50 credits Students in either track must satisfy the Core Requirement ( Sec. 2.2 ). Additional requirements are listed in Sec. 2.2.1 for the Research Track and in Sec. 2.2.2 for the Coursework Track. Students transferring credits for their degree should note the requirements in Section 2.4 below. 2.2 Degree Program Each candidate is required to pursue a program of study in courses approved by his/her academic advisor. Students in the non-thesis track need to complete 30 graded credits. Students in the non-thesis track need to complete 45 graded credits, or 39 graded credtis and a masters project, as detailed in Section 2.4 . For students in either track, at most 9 credits from classes taken outside of CSE may count towards these requirements. Thses classes must be from disciplines closely related to CSE, and need to be approved in advance by the student's advisor. 600-800 level letter-graded CSE classes will be considered to be of four types: Primarily Undergraduate Classes: These classes include CSE 616, 625, 630 655, 660, 670, 675, 677, and 680. This list will be periodically updatedby the graduate studies commitee. Both non-thesis and thesis studentsare limited to taking at most 3 classes from this group, to count towards their 30/45 graded credit requirement. Foundation Core: This group includes 725, 755, 760, 775, and 780. Note that the department also offers and undergraduate class in each of these areas - 625, 655, 660, 675, and 680, which are referred to as pre-core classes. All students need to pass at least three of the five foundational core classes, including 780 and at least one of 760 and 775. In the area where a student does not take a foundational core class, he/she must take the pre-core class, or show that they have taken an equivalent class before coming to OSU. Applied Core: This group currently includes 621, 678, 681, 730, 756, and 770. This list will be periodically updated by the graduate studies committee. One software engineering class is likely to be added in the near future. Students in the thesis option must take at least two classes from this group, and students in the non-thesis option must take at least three classes from this group. All other 600-800 level letter-graded classes offered by the CSE department. There are no minimum or maximum requirements, except that non-thesis students no taking the project option (see below) must take at least one class that counts for capstone requirements for the BS CSE program. Students who are able to transfer graduate credit for these classes or who took equivalent courses as undergraduates may substitute other appropriate courses in their program, with the approval of their advisors. 2.2.1 Additional Requirements: Research Track Master Thesis: All students in the Research Track are required to complete a Master's Thesis ( Sec. 3 ). Research course requirement: Students are required to register for at least 3 credits of research (788/793/888/999) every quarter, from their second quarter onwards. Letter graded course requirement: At least 30 of the credit hours applied toward the degree must be from letter graded courses. (Core courses are letter graded and count toward this 30 credit requirement.) CIS 885: Students are required to complete CIS 885 (Seminar on research topics in CSE.) 2.2.2 Additional Requirements: Coursework Track CIS 885: Students are required to complete CIS 885 (Seminar on research topics in CSE.) 2.3 Thesis Each student on the Research Track must submit an approved thesis, based on appropriate research experience, in accordance with Departmental and Graduate School regulations. The Master's thesis must be produced under the direction and with the approval of the student's research advisor, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty. The Graduate School Handbook should be consulted for rules, procedures, and deadlines for preparation and submission of the final approved copy of the thesis. Each candidate (in either the Research Track or Coursework Track) must also pass a Master's Examination to test his/her knowledge of the course of study pursued. The rules governing the Master's Examination are given in Section 3 . 2.4 Project Option Masters non-thesis students may take 6 S/U credits (793 or 888) over two consecutive quarters to complete a substantial implementation project with a CSE faculty member. a 3-4 page write-up on the features of the software and design choices must be completed and approved by the CSE facutly member supervising the project. This write-up should be included with the masters paperwork for the student. These credits will count towards the 45 graded course requirement. 2.5 Residency and Transfer Credit Satisfactory completion of 36 hours of graduate credit (Research Track), or 42 hours of graduate credit (Coursework Track), over a minimum of two quarters at this university, is required. Students who transfer credits from other departments or other universities in order to qualify for the degree, must submit their Request for Application or Transfer of Credit no later than the second quarter of enrollment in the graduate school. 2.6 Academic Standards A graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average in all graduate credit courses, with no more than one-third of the credit hours with grades of C or lower. Students whose performance falls below the above standard are subject to the Graduate School rules which apply to probationary status or dismissal. In addition, a graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average in all courses applied towards the student's CSE degree. Only courses in which a graduate student has received a C (2.00) or higher may be applied to the student's CSE degree. 2.7 Application to Graduate and Declaration of Examiniation Forms Students must submit an \"Application to Graduate\" form to the department office by the seventh Friday of the quarter preceding the quarter of expected graduation. All students desiring the Master of Science degree must file a Declaration of Examination form with the Chair of the Department's M.S. Comprehensive Examination Committee by the seventh week of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the degree is sought. These forms, and instructions for their use, are available in the Department office. Both forms require approval by the student's academic advisor before submission to the Department. Failure to submit these forms on time will usually result in the student not being able to graduate in the quarter desired. No student will be allowed to take the Master's examination until he or she has received graduate credit for at least 24 quarter hours at this university and reasonably can be expected to complete all of the requirements for the Master's degree in the quarter for which the \"Application to Graduate\" form is filed. Students are expected, however to take the Master's examination by the time they have completed 50 credit hours. Any exceptions to this rule must be petitioned to the Graduate Studies Committee. 2.8 Time Limit The entire work for the Master's degree must be completed within a period of six calendar years. In the case of students who take all the work for the Master's degree during summer quarters, the above rule will be interpreted to include the seventh Summer Quarter. 3 Master's Examination A Master's Examination is required to test the candidate's knowledge of the courses of study he/she has pursued. Students must have filed an \"Application to Graduate\" form ( Section 2.5 ) before they can take this examination. If a student fails to perform satisfactorily on the Master's Examination and desires to take it again in order to get the Master's degree, he/she must enroll the following quarter for at least three credits and take the final examination in that quarter. Any exceptions to this rule must have the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. In accordance with Graduate School regulations, no student will be permitted to take this examination a third time. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe the details concerning the format and scheduling of the Master's Examination for students on the Research Track and Coursework Track. 3.1 Research Track (Thesis Option) The Master's Examination is held after the draft of the thesis is approved. Final thesis approval occurs after the examination. The examination must be oral and may include a written portion, at the option of the examination committee. The chair of the committee is to be the candidate's research advisor, and the committee must include at least one other member of the committee who is a member of the Graduate Faculty with primary appointment in the CSE Department. The Graduate Studies Committee may appoint additional members of the committee if it considers it necessary. The committee chair is responsible for arranging and conducting the examination, which is to be based on the subject matter of the thesis as well as the course of study which the candidate has pursued. The chair of the examining committee is also responsible for certifying the examination results and reporting them to the Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School office within the prescribed time set by the Graduate School. 3.2 Coursework Track (Non-Thesis Option) All candidates on the Coursework Track must pass a written comprehensive examination composed of examinations in three of the five core areas. These exams are based on the 700 level graduate core classes. All students must take the exam based on CSE 780, and at least one from the exams based on CSE 760 and CSE 775. The candidate must specify which areas they will take the exam in when completing the declaration of examination form. Examination in each of the areas is of 90 minute duration, and these examinations are administered over a 2 day duration. Currently, these exams are offered in Autumn and Spring Quarters. 4 Master's Degree on Basis of Ph.D. Candidacy Examination Ph.D. students who have not previously obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering may be recommended for the Master of Science degree after taking their Ph.D.Candidacy Examinations under the following conditions: It is recommended by the student's advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee; The student does not already hold an equivalent master's degree in the same field; Graduation deadlines established by the Graduate School are met. The Graduate School Handbook is to be consulted for the applicable procedural details.

Evaluation was to be the responsibility of an external evaluator, Dr. Jerome D'Agostino who specializes in program assessment. Unfortunately, Dr. D'Agostino could not continue the evaluation activities; hence he resigned from this role in September '09. Fortunately, we were able to find a new evaluator, Dr. Kathleen Carr, to replace him. Dr. Carr is president and CEO of Strategic Research Group (SRG) , a full service research company providing data collection, analysis and consultative services. Dr. Carr is currently (Winter '10) working on continuing and strengthening the previously started evaluation activities. Both her qualifications and expertise on the one hand, and close working relation with the NEWPATH faculty on the other hand, should be of great value in assessing the extent to which NEWPATH is achieving its outcomes and to arrive at possible changes to address any problems that the assessments may reveal. A rubric-based approach is expected to be adopted to evaluate some components of NEWPATH and the extent to which it achieves its outcomes, internships being one of these components. Initial versions of the rubrics for evaluating internships ( supervisor rubric , student rubric ) have been developed and are being piloted. Dr. D'Agostino plans to work closely with NEWPATH faculty in developing and refining the rubrics.

The two degrees may be part of a dual Masters degree program or they may be unrelated. In the first case, the student should complete the program plan for dual Master's degree students required by the Graduate School and must comply with all the Graduate School rules for dual degrees. In the second case, the two degrees are pursued independently. Graduate students who are pursuing a Master's degree in CSE in addition to a graduate degree in their home department are part of the CSE Master's Research Track and must complete a CSE Master's Thesis for their degree. They must meet all the CSE requirements for students in the CSE Master's Research Track. Applicants to the CSE Master's program who are already OSU graduate students must follow all the rules and requirements of regular applicants to the CSE graduate program. In particular, applicants must fulfill all the course prerequisites of regular applicants to CSE graduate studies. In addition, applicants who intend to pursue a CSE degree in addition to their graduate degree in their home department must include the following: 1) A letter from a faculty member in their home department supporting their application to the CSE Master's program; 2) A letter of support from a CSE faculty member including evidence of involvement in research activity with the faculty member, i.e., research related courses and/or projects. The letter should also clearly state that the faculty member intends to be the student's thesis advisor. Students must apply to the CSE Master's program at the beginning of their CSE graduate studies, even if they do not officially transfer to the CSE department until the quarter they graduate. Only the CSE Graduate Admissions Committee can admit students to the CSE Master's program.

CSE/CIS Placement Exam CSE/CIS Placement Exam CSE 2221 Placement Test Passing the CSE 2221 placement test is an alternative for taking one of the prerequisite programming classes (CSE 1222 or 1223). Students will not be awarded credit for any entry level course by passing but are eligible to register for CSE 2221 assuming they meet the other prerequisites. Students who have credit for or are planning on taking CSE 1222 or 1223 should not take the placement test. It is intended for students who believe they already know how to program reasonably well. Topics Variables, types, expressions, and assignment statements Fundamental or built-in types for working with integer-, real-, Boolean-, character-, and text-string-valued data Simple input from a keyboard or a file, and simple output to a monitor or a file Conditional control structures such as \"if\" and \"if-else\" Iterative control structures such as \"while\" Programming Language Students are asked to write, as a paper-and-pencil exercise, short programs or program segments. Students may write their answers using any programming language they know well. However, experience shows that students who know only the BASIC programming language, or its visual variants, often are not well prepared for the CSE Placement Exam. Sample Question Write a program, in a programming language of your choice, that repeatedly prompts a user to input a positive integer value. At any point, if the user enters 0 or a negative integer value, then the program should print the minimum of all of the positive integer values entered by the user, and then terminate execution. For example, if a user enters the values 4 13 8 11 2 66 5 0, then the program should report that the smallest of the positive values entered is 2. Program output should include appropriate user-friendly headings. Test Registration Please schedule your exam through\u00a0the Testing Center by going to the Examination Mark (EM) Tests Then click \"Register Online\" under the \"Take an EM test at Testing Center\". Then select \"OSU Testing under Choose a Group 1. Then select \"OSU Placement Test\" under Choose a Group 2. Then \"CSE 2221 Placement Test: Software 1\" under Choose an Exam. Once the test is completed, it is graded by a faculty member and an advisor will email you the result as soon as it is available. Results could take up to a week.",

    "text_content": "Combined BS/MS in Computer Science and Engineering | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students Current Students Combined BS/MS in Computer Science and Engineering Combined BS/MS in Computer Science and Engineering Application to the CSE Department's combined BS/MS program is open to currently enrolled CSE and CIS undergraduate majors with outstanding academic records. The program allows undergraduates to start graduate study while completing the BS degree. In the combined program, up to 9 credit hours of courses may be applied simultaneously (\"double counted\") for credit toward both the BS and MS degrees. This can shorten the total time to get a BS degree plus an MS degree by 1 semester. The goal of the combined program is to encourage undergraduates to obtain an advanced degree. There are several steps involved: E-mail the Computer Science Undergrad Advising Office ( compsciadvising@osu.edu ) to set up an appointment to discuss your plans, to check eligibility, and to decide which semester should be your \"double count\" semester. If you are eligible, apply for admission to the CSE graduate program by filing, in order, the OSU Graduate School admission application , the Combined Degree program form , and a schedule projection provided by the undergraduate advisor and approved by both a CS undergraduate advisor and a CSE graduate program representative, by the established deadlines: --Autumn Semester: Jan 31 prior --Spring Semester (most common): Oct 1 prior (Examples: Students planning to use Autumn 2024\u00a0as their \"double count\" semester should file by January 31, 2024.\u00a0 Students planning to use Spring 2025\u00a0as their \"double count\" semester should file by Oct 1, 2024). The CSE Graduate Admission Committee will accept you for graduate study if your record qualifies you for graduate admission under departmentally established criteria . Register for courses in your \"double count\" term as an undergraduate student. Make sure to follow all requirements for graduating with your BS degree, including applying for graduation. After graduating with your undergraduate degree, continue with your Master's coursework. Eligibility You must meet all requirements imposed by the OSU Graduate School for combined BS/MS programs, and by the CSE Department for its graduate programs. See the official OSU Graduate School Handbook and the CSE Department Graduate Admissions webpage for the most up-to-date information. You are eligible for the combined BS/MS program in the CSE Department if you meet the following criteria: you are an OSU undergraduate CSE or CIS major; you have at least a 3.5 CPHR in all previous undergraduate work at the time of application; you have completed at least 90 undergraduate credit hours toward the BS degree; you satisfy all regular graduate admission requirements of the CSE Department, including personal statement, letters of reference, etc.; you indicate on your graduate application your desire to enter the combined BS/MS program, and complete the Combined BS/MS form as required by the OSU Graduate School; you submit an approved schedule projection (document will be provided when you meet with the CS undergraduate advisor) you are admitted to graduate study under the normal graduate admission criteria and processes. Things To Watch Out For Only courses you take during the double-count semester will count toward both degrees. Courses taken before then will not count toward the MS degree. Only 5000- and 6000-level courses will count toward the MS degree.\u00a0 If you wish to take a 6000-level course as a \"double count\" course, you will have to work with a CS undergraduate advisor to add the course. A maximum of 9 hours of \"double count\" courses are allowed, and these hours must be arrived at naturally (no splitting of hours).\u00a0 Work with the CS undergraduate advisor to determine the best course options, particularly if you want to use a capstone course (which is 4 hours) as one of your \"double count\" courses.\u00a0 \u00a0The \"double count\" are the ONLY courses to be listed on the Combined Degree Program form.\u00a0 The schedule projection document will contain these courses plus any other courses you plan to take during the \"double count\" term. Students are encouraged to apply for fellowships and assistantships as part of the graduate-admission process.\u00a0 However, there are some restrictions on holding positions that involve teaching other students; check with the OSU Graduate School for current regulations. Finally, if you hold a graduate fellowship or graduate associate position, then you must meet all graduate-credit-hour and other requirements associated with that position.

Establish and maintain procedures for assigning and changing advisors. Consider and act on student petitions, including writing letters of petition for exceptions. Appoint faculty for Category I and II membership, and nominate faculty for Category III membership to the Executive Committee of the Graduate School. (Because Category III nominations are based on qualifications similar to those involved in tenure considerations, and because of the sensitivity of discussions pertaining to evaluation of those qualifications, decisions on Category III nominations are delegated to the tenured faculty at the request of the Graduate Studies Chairperson when a faculty member seems to have the necessary qualifications for nomination to Category III.) Approve applications to take Comp/Qual examination. Approve applications to graduate for M.S. and Ph.D. students. Approve membership of graduate student general examination committee as well as appoint a Departmental representative to each general exam, and approve Doctoral Reading Committees. Assume other responsibilities as assigned to it by the Graduate School, the graduate faculty members of the Department, the Department Chair, or the committee members themselves (with approval of the graduate faculty members of the Department). Handle all nominations of current graduate students or faculty for college, University, or national awards; normally this requires forming a nominating subcommittee, collecting up-to-date nomination materials (minimally vitae, but possibly reference letters and other material as well), convening the subcommittee, and handling the final processing of nomination materials.

ABET is organized into commissions which carry out the accreditation evaluations. The Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) is responsible for evaluation of engineering programs. The Computing Accreditation Commission is responsible for evaluation of computing programs. The BS-CSE program, given its name, is subject to evaluation by both EAC and CAC. Programs have to undergo periodic reevaluations (at least once every six years but, based on the results of an evaluation, ABET may require additional, interim evaluations) in order to remain accredited. Our program was last evaluated in Au '05. Hence it is up for reevaluation in Au '11. Programs are evaluated against criteria defined by the respective commissions. The EAC and CAC criteria against which our program is evaluated are available here . Specifically, see: EAC Criteria (PDF) ( key extract ) CAC Criteria (PDF) ( key extract ) 2011-2012 Accreditation Policy and Procedure Manual (PDF) The evaluation consists of the following steps: We submit a comprehensive self-study document that demonstrates how the program meets the EAC and CAC Criteria. ABET appoints an evaluation team that conducts a site visit (scheduled for October 9-11, 2011). During the site visit, the evaluation team will examine course materials; talk to faculty, staff, and students; visit computing labs, the library, etc.; and talk to various people in the College, in the Registrar's office, etc. The purpose of the site visit is to check the accuracy of the material presented in the self-study and, more generally, to see how well the program meets the criteria requirements. The team presents its findings at an oral exit interview with the university higher administration at the end of the site visit; and submits a draft report about a month or so after the visit. We will have a chance to provide a due process response addressing any issues that the team identifies. ABET typically makes its final decision, based on the draft report and the due process response, during its annual meeting in July. We should receive the final report in August/September 2012. We have submitted the self-study and collected course materials from all required courses and the popular elective courses. All of this is available on-line (log-in required; contact Neelam). Preparations for the site visit on Oct. 9-11 are under way.

The BS-CSE program is offered via the College of Engineering; the BS-CIS and BA-CIS are in the College of Arts and Sciences. The Computer Science portion of the BS-CSE and BS-CIS programs are nearly identical to each other; the CS portion of the BA-CIS program is a subset of that of the BS-CIS and BS-CSE programs. For details of the curricula of the three programs, please see this page . This page focuses on the assessment and improvement of the BS-CSE program. However, the improvements in CS courses based on the assessment results apply also to the BS-CIS program because of the commonality described above; and, in the case of improvements related to CS courses (such as Software I, II or the junior project course) that are in subset of courses taken by BA-CIS majors, apply to the BA-CIS program as well. A. Introduction This page is intended both to document our efforts related to the assessment, evaluation, and continuous improvement of the BS-CSE program, as well as to help direct those efforts. It will help various constituents including current students, alumni, employers of graduates of the program, and others, understand the growth and evolution of the program and the rationale behind the evolution. It is expected to provide the documentation needed to show that the program meets the requirements of the ABET criteria, especially the requirements concerning program educational objectives, student outcomes, assessment, evaluation , and continuous improvement . It is also intended to serve as a resource for other engineering, computing, and technology programs who are in the process of developing their own assessment and evaluation processes to meet the ABET criteria. Please send comments, questions, or suggestions for improvements to this or any related pages to neelam AT cse.ohio-state.edu Background information and information about the (now successfully concluded) Au '11 ABET evaluation of the BS-CSE program are available here . B. ABET Terminology and Criteria Requirements In its criteria, ABET uses specific terms defined in particular ways. It is important to keep these definitions in mind when understanding the criteria requirements. In particular, the following terms are important: Program Educational Objectives : PEOs are broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation. Program educational objectives are based on the needs of the program's constituencies. An example PEO: graduates will be employed successfully as computing professionals. Student Outcomes : SOs describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program. An example SO: students will acquire an ability to communicate effectively. The intent is that achievement of the SOs will prepare the graduates to attain the PEOs. Assessment : one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to evaluate the attainment of SOs and PEOs. Effective assessment uses both direct and indirect, and quantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate to the objective or outcome being measured. Direct assessment is assessment of actual student work by someone qualified to assess it; indirect assessment refers to things like student and alumni surveys. In general, direct assessments are preferred. Note: the purpose of assessment is to assess the program , not individual students. Evaluation : one or more processes for interpreting assessment data to help identify weaknesses and/or potential improvements in the program in a process of continuous improvement. Summary of ABET criteria requirements : PEOs must be determined based on the needs of the program's constituencies. There must be a documented and effective process, involving the constituencies, for the periodic review and revision of the PEOs. PEOs must be published. SOs must include the (a-k) outcomes listed in EAC Criterion 3; the (a-i) in CAC Criterion 3; and the (j-k) in CAC's Program Criteria for CS programs. SOs must prepare graduates to attain PEOs; there must be a documented and effective process for the periodic review and revision of the SOs. SOs must be documented. The program must use appropriate, documented processes for evaluating the extent to which both PEOs and SOs are being attained. The results of these evaluations must be documented and must be utilized as input for the continuous improvement of the program. Other available information may also be used to assist in this. C. Program Educational Objectives C.1 Current PEOs The PEOs of the BS-CSE program are: Graduates of the program will be employed in the computing profession, and will be engaged in learning, understanding, and applying new ideas and technologies as the field evolves. Graduates with an interest in, and aptitude for, advanced studies in computing will have completed, or be actively pursuing, graduate studies in computing. Graduates will be informed and involved members of their communities, and responsible engineering and computing professionals. These objectives are published on the OSU Undergraduate Majors site and on the program's site . C.2 Process for assessment and review of PEOs The main constituents for the program are current students, alumni, and the computing industry, represented by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB). Input from current students is obtained on all aspects of the program, including the PEOs, at an open Undergraduate Forum that is held each year. The forum is held in the Winter quarter and is attended by interested students, key faculty members, and advisors from the Advising Office. It should be stressed, however, that discussion of PEOs is, typically, only a very small component of any of the forums. The IAB convenes for a day-long meeting every year on campus, typically in late May. The board gets a detailed update on various recent developments in the department related to research, graduate programs, and undergraduate programs. Once every three years or so, input is sought from the board on the PEOs. Alumni are especially important in the assessment of PEOs since they have intimate knowledge of the program and, at the same time, also have experience in industry. Input from alumni is obtained by means of an alumni survey . The survey is sent to alumni who graduated either two or three years prior to the survey date. Thus the approach lets us gather input from alumni who graduated relatively recently and hence have more or less current knowledge of the program but also have some experience in the job market and hence can comment on how well the program prepared them for the profession. The key portion of the survey that relates to PEOs asks the respondent to rate, on a scale of very unimportant through extremely important , the importance of each of the PEOs. Next, the respondent is asked to rate, on a scale of strongly disagree through strongly agree , the extent to which they agreed with the statement, \"the BS-CSE program adequately prepared me to achieve the PEO\". C.3 Assessment results Annual forum: Announcements about the annual Forum are made widely, especially on the electronic (student) newsgroups and listservs to ensure wide participation. Following the forum, a summary of the discussion is posted on the newsgroups by the chair of the Undergraduate Studies Committee (UGSC). The report is then discussed in regularly scheduled meetings of the UGSC to help identify possible improvements in the programContinuous Improvement section later\nin this page)-->. Reports from forums of the last several years are available here: Undergraduate Forum Reports Alumni Survey: The alumni survey is administered every other year, the most recent ones being in 2006, 2008, and 2009-'10; the next one is planned to be in early 2012. Prior to 2006, the survey was administered as a paper survey. In 2006, the survey was moved on-line. As noted above, the survey is sent to alumni who graduated either two or three years prior to the survey date. Since the survey is conducted every other year, this ensures that all graduates will receive the survey (exactly) once. TheSurvey results are discussed in regularly scheduled meetings of the UGSC to help identify possible improvements in the program Full details of the survey and results from the three recent surveys are available here: Alumni Survey Results . D. Student Outcomes D.1 Current SOs Students in the BS-CSE program will attain: an ability to apply knowledge of computing, mathematics including discrete mathematics as well as probability and statistics, science, and engineering; an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data; an ability to design, implement, and evaluate a software or a software/hardware system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as memory, runtime efficiency, as well as appropriate constraints related to economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability considerations; an ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams; an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems; an understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society; a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning and continuing professional development; a knowledge of contemporary issues; an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for practice as a CSE professional; an ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution; an ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices; an ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity. These SOs subsume outcomes (a) through (k) of EAC Criterion 3; (a) through (i) of CAC Criterion 3; and (j), (k) of the CAC Program Criteria for CS programs. These SOs are published on the program's site . Relation to PEOs : Outcomes (a) through (c), (e), and (k) through (n) ensure that graduates will be well prepared to succeed in challenging positions in the computing profession thus contributing to achieving PEO (I). Outcomes (d) and (g) will prepare graduates to work effectively as part of teams of CSE professionals, further contributing to their success as CSE professionals. Outcome (i), along with the solid technical background ensured by outcomes (a), (b), (e), and (l) through (n) will prepare graduates to achieve PEO (II), pursuit of advanced/graduate studies in computing. Outcomes (f), (g), (h), and (j) will prepare gradutes to be informed and involved members of their communities and to be responsible engineering and computing professionals, thereby helping them achieve PEO (III). D.2 Process for assessment and review of SOs We have classified the SOs into two groups. Outcomes (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (k), (l), (m), and (n) form the technical group of SOs; (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) form the professional group of SOs; note that outcome (f) is included in both groups. Previously, we had split the professional group into two subgroups, \"societal issues\" and \"professional skills\"; but the outcomes are so closely related that we have merged these two into a single group, the professional outcomes group. (But some of the pages in this site may still refer to these as two distinct groups; if you notice such references, please email neelam AT cse.ohio-state.edu). POCAT , an exit-test, is used to assess the technical group of SOs. A set of rubrics , used to evaluate certain key activities in the capstone design courses and in CSE 601, the required course on professional and ethical issues in computing, is used to assess the professional group of SOs. An exit-survey is used to assess both groups of outcomes. POCAT and the rubrics are direct assessments, the exit survey an indirect assessment. We consider each in turn. D.2.1 Assessment of the technical group of SOs using POCAT POCAT (Program OutComes Achievement Test), is an exit-test that all BS-CSE majors take prior to graduation. When a BS-CSE major applies for graduation, generally three quarters before the expected date of graduation, he or she is asked to sign up to take POCAT. The test is offered once each quarter, typically in the third or fourth week of the quarter. Although all CSE students are required to take the test, the performance on the test does not affect the grades of individual students in any courses, nor are records retained on how individual students performed on the test. When a group of students takes the POCAT, each student receives a unique code that appears on that student's test but only the individual student knows his or her code. Once the tests have been graded, summary results, organized by this code, are posted on electronic bulletin boards so an interested student can see how well he or she did and how his or her performance compared with that of others who took the test. This was a deliberate decision since we did not want the students to spend a lot of time preparing for the test. The goal of the test is to help assess the program by assessing the extent to which the students have acquired and internalized the knowledge and skills associated with the various SOs, not assess individual students. Initially, there was a concern that if the individual students' performance on the test did not affect them in any tangible way, they would not take the test seriously. Our experience with the test has eliminated that concern; most students enjoy taking the test and take it seriously. At the same time, security of the test is not a concern since students do not have to worry about how their performance will affect their records; hence, for example, it is perfectly appropriate to reuse questions from one POCAT to the next and we do so often. The questions on POCAT are based on topics from a number of required and the most popular elective high-level courses related to a variety of key topics such as software engineering, formal languages and automata theory, databases, programming languages, computer architecture, algorithm analysis, AI, computer graphics, etc. Each question is a multiple-choice with, typically, two or three questions in each topic area. The ideal POCAT question not only has a specific correct answer but has distractors that are so chosen that they correspond to common misconceptions that students tend to have about the particular concept. It is for this reason that the summary results of a POCAT includes information not only about the percentage of students who answered a question correctly but also the percentages of students who chose each of the distractors, in other words how many students harbored the particular misconceptions represented by the various distractors about the underlying concept(s). The questions on the test are chosen in such a way that there are one or more questions related to each Group 1 outcome. Indeed, because of the nature of the questions and the nature of the outcomes, many of the questions tend to be related to more than one outcome in the group. There is one unusual feature of the POCAT questions that is worth noting. Each question on the test has, as one of the choices (typically the last one), an answer along the lines of \"I don't know\". The instructions for the test suggest that the student should pick that answer if he or she has no idea what the correct answer is. Since their performance on the test will have no impact on their record, students who do not know the answer to the question and know that they do not know , pick this answer. This means we do not have to worry about students making wild guesses and confounding our attempt to pin down misconceptions that they may have. The grading of POCAT and production of summary results is mechanical. The faculty members responsible for each question also provide an estimate of the percentage of students who ought to be able to answer the question correctly as well as the particular outcomes that the question is related to. All of this information is included in the summary results. This allows the UGSC to have a well-informed discussion about the extent to which the particular group of students had achieved these outcomes and identify potential problem spots in particular courses, indeed in particular topics, and bring them to the attention of the appropriate group of faculty. The result page for each POCAT includes three key tables. The first one lists, for each question, the particular answer (including, possibly, the \"I don't know\" one) each student picked for that question. The second table lists, for each question and each possible answer for the question, the number of students who picked that answer; there is also a summary line that specifies what percentage of students answered that question correctly. The third table lists, for each of the SOs, the average level achievement of that SO. This is computed on the basis of the SOs that each question is related to and the number of students who answered that question correctly. Of these, the second table is perhaps the most valuable since it allows UGSC and relevant faculty to identify which particular misconceptions students most commonly hold concerning a given topic and, hence, arrive at possible improvements to address the problem. Results from all the POCATs are available here: POCAT Results (outcomes (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (k), (l), (m), (n)) D.2.2 Assessment of the professional group of SOs using rubrics By their nature, both the achievement of the professional SOs as well as their assessment require different approaches than for the technical SOs. In general, a variety of courses from across the curriculum, including several non-CSE courses, contribute to the achievement of a number of the professional SOs. At the same time, both in order to ensure that students engage in activities that help achieve these outcomes in a CSE context , and in order to help with assessment of the extent to which they achieve these outcomes, we have adopted the following approach. CSE 601, the 1-credit required course on social, ethical and professional issues in computing, and each of the capstone design courses include a number of activities that are tailored to the professional SOs while, at the same time, being well-integrated with the courses. CSE 601 requires each student to explore a new or recent product or practice or event etc. (outcome (i) (as well as outcome (k))), consider the impact it may have in a \"global, economic, environmental, and societal context\" (outcome (h)); consider as well any relevant contemporary issues (outcome (j)) as well as ethical and professional issues (outcome (f)) related to the product, practice, or event; and present the findings in a 3-4 page paper. CSE 601 includes this activity in order to further develop the degree of student achievement of these outcomes. Naturally, this activity also contributes to the development of written communication skills (outcome (g)). In addition, the course requires students to make oral presentations (outcome (g)) on topics related to social, ethical, and professional issues in computing. Suitable rubrics, each with appropriate dimensions corresponding to the component skills of these outcomes, have been developed to assess the extent to which students are achieving these outcomes as exhibited by their performance in these activities. Turning next to the capstone design courses, the central activity in each of these courses is, of course, a quarter-long design and, in most cases, implementation project. The courses require student teams to make a number of oral presentations and produce suitable written design documentation (including such things as storyboards) accessible to clients, project managers, peers, etc., thereby contributing to outcome (g). The courses also require students to engage in an activity similar to that in 601, researching a product or practice, typically that is relevant to the team's project, and write a paper or make presenations about it, thus contributing to (i). One of the capstone design courses, CSE 786, has developed an especially innovative way (dubbed \"technology teams\") for this component of the course that not only helps students develop life-long learning skills but also engages them in additional team activity. Often the team projects and/or the researched tools raise questions related to ethical, legal, etc., issues, thus contributing to (f); as well as issues related to impact of aspects of computing on individuals and society and related contemporary issues, thereby contributing also to (h) and (j). As in the case of CSE 601, suitable rubrics, each with appropriate dimensions corresponding to the component skills of these outcomes, have been developed to assess the extent to which students are achieving these outcomes as exhibited by their performance in these activities. More details of the capstone design courses are available in here . Rubrics for assessment of professional outcomes : Rubric for assessing life-long learning paper in CSE 601 (outcomes (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j)) Rubric for assessing individual presentations (outcomes (g)) Rubric for assessing team work (outcome (d)) Rubric for assessing team presentations (outcomes (d), (g)) Rubric for assessing technology research as part of a technology team (outcomes (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j)). Sample assessment results from some recent courses (in each case, S1, S2, ... etc. refer to individual students whose work was assessed): Results of assessing life-long learning paper in a recent section of CSE 601 (outcomes (g), (h), (i), and (j)) Results of assessing oral presentation in a recent section of CSE 601 (outcome (g)) Results of assessing team presentation in a recent section of CSE 758 (outcomes (d), (g)) Results of assessing team presentation in a recent section of CSE 682 (outcomes (d), (g)) Assessment of technology team presentation in a recent section of CSE 786 (outcomes (d), (g), (h), (i), and (j)) Assessment of team work by peers in a recent section of CSE 786 (outcome (d)) Rubric for assessment of capstone course : Since the capstone design course plays such an important role with respect to several of the SOs, and since external reviewers are invited to examine the results of student projects in (some of) these courses, starting in Spring '13, we are experimenting with using this rubric (based directly on one developed by Steve Lavender of ISE) for assessing some of the important student outcomes. Results will be collected and discussed in the Undergrad Studies Comm. D.2.3 Assessment of all SOs using the Exit-Survey Prior to graduation, BS-CSE majors are required to complete an an anonymous exit survey ; in fact, students complete the exit-survey and take the POCAT in the same session. There are three parts to the survey. The first one asks the respondent, for each student outcome, to rank its importance on a scale of very-unimportant/somewhat-unimportant/ somewhat-important/very-important ; and asks how strongly the respondent agreed with the statement \"this student outcome has been achieved for me personally\" on a scale of strongly-disagree/moderately-disagree/ slightly-disagree/slightly-agree/moderately-agree/strongly-agree . In averaging the responses, we attached weights of 0%, 33%, 67%, and 100% to the four possible importance ratings; and weights of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% to the six possible achievement ratings. The second part of the exit survey asks students to evaluate the quality of faculty advising as well as the quality of staff advising. Students are asked to consider four specific items: Faculty Advising with respect to course choices; Faculty Advising with respect to graduate school, career options, etc; Staff Advising with respect to curricular issues; Staff Advising with respect to career options, graduate school, university policies and procedures, referrals, etc. Students are asked to rank the importance of each item; and the quality of advising, as it relates to that specific item, that they received. The third part of the survey asks students to briefly respond to two questions. The first asks, \"What single aspect of the CSE program did you find most helpful? Explain briefly.\" The second asks, \"What single change in the CSE program would you most like to see? Explain briefly.\" These two parts of the survey, although not directly related to specific student outcomes, are naturally very important to students and provide us a good lens through which to view the program and help identify possible improvements. Results from the last four years' surveys are available here: Exit Survey Results E. Continuous Improvement The various assessment processes listed above, the evaluations of their results in UGSC discussions, other assessments such as from student performance in individual courses and input from other ad-hoc sources and their evaluations all have resulted in a number of improvements in the program. Many of these improvements have been in individual courses; others have been at the program level; and yet others have been in the assessment/evaluation processes themselves. Below we list a few of the recent improvements in each of these categories, along with brief descriptions. In the case of the improvements in the first two categories, we also identify the related student outcome(s) or PEO. We also identify the specific assessments (Undergrad Forum, Alumni Survey, Exit Survey, POCAT, assessment using the rubrics listed above, IAB discussions, or other (such as student performance in specific activities in individual courses)) whose results and their evaluation led to the particular improvement/change. In some cases, some of the details of the improvement are still being discussed or yet to be implemented; such cases are marked with a \"*\". In most cases, the evaluation of the assessment results and the possible program improvements are discussed initially in UGSC meetings, followed by actions by relevant faculty. In other cases, especially those based on the results of assessment of student performance in specific activities in individual courses, the evaluation and the program improvements are initiated by individual faculty or faculty groups. In a few cases, especially those involving the Alumni Survey, the College of Engineering's Outcomes Committee is often part of the discussion since some of the items on the survey apply to all programs in the college. E.1 Improvements in Courses CSE 221, 222, 321: [Related SOs/PEOs: (b), (k); assessment instruments: UG Forum] At one of the annual forums, some students noted that that they spent a lot of time figuring out some errors they got from the C++ compiler and felt that, given the simple nature of the underlying problem --once they figured it out-- that was the source of the errors, it should not have been so difficult to understand it. Most such problems are, in fact, addressed in the on-line FAQ for the sequence. However, many students do not read the information in these pages. In order to address this, the faculty responsible for these courses created surveys to be completed by students in CSE 222 and 321 that asked the students to respond to the following questions: Briefly describe one specific technical problem you encountered and solved in CSE 221 (or, in the case of the survey for students in 321, in CSE 222). For example, it could be a problem you had while working on a lab assignment, or in the use of the CSE computing environment, or any other issue that you struggled with--yet managed to solve--and that you wish you could have known about before you had to deal with it. Briefly explain the solution to the problem described above and how you managed to find it. Is this problem and its solution listed on the Resolve/C++ FAQ pages at: http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/sce/rcpp/FAQ/index.html ? Based on the student responses, a number of actions have been taken: Improved the FAQ to provide detailed information about reading compiler errors and the manner in which \"build\" and \"make\" work when a project is recompiled. Added an \"open lab\" in 221 where a key goal of the lab is to help students learn to use the information in the FAQ to understand both compile-time and run-time errors. Developed a \"closed lab\" that requires students to exercise their Unix/Emacs skills, including absolute and relative paths for copying files and doing submissions; Emacs window buffers; and Unix command line short cuts. Worked with the computing system staff to standardize remote access utilities and offer a regular workshop/clinic to help students set up their computers to enable remote access to departmental compute servers. CSE 222: [Related SOs/PEOs: (c), (e), (f), (n); I; assessment instruments: other] The first programming lab in CSE 222 addresses a number of course learning outcomes, all of which are of a technical nature (e.g., \"Be competent with using the computing environment to complete lab assignments\" and \"Be familiar with using [various software components] to write application programs and/or component implementations\"). Student performance on this lab tends to be all over the map. Analysis shows that, in a typical section of CSE 222, fewer than a third of the students submit solutions that meet the stated requirements, about half submit solutions that compile and execute but fail to meet all the requirements, and the rest either submit code that does not compile or do not submit a solution at all. In order to confront the problems faced by the middle portion -- who previously seemed to throw up their hands and simply move on -- we have instituted a \"revise and resubmit\" policy for this lab. This is similar to what might happen for an English composition assignment, except that students are not told about the opportunity to revise and resubmit until after their initial submissions have been graded and returned. The graders for this first lab now use a rather harsh grading rubric, so even a seemingly minor deviation from a stated requirement results in a score of 80% or less, leaving many students who thought they had done \"pretty well\" believing they should have received more partial credit. We therefore give them an opportunity (on this lab only) to consider the grader's feedback and to resubmit a revised solution a short time later. We use this occasion to discuss in class why \"good enough\" is not good enough for software, how failure to understand and meet all customer requirements may in some cases result in loss of life, limb, money, or mission-critical opportunities for their clients. This change in the course has been positive in the sense that the number of submissions in the middle group on subsequent CSE 222 lab assignments has been noticeably smaller. This experience also has resulted in changes to how we have written the course learning outcomes for our first semester course in this area, Software I (CSE 2221). Rather than being primarily technical in scope, the first few outcomes of Software I deal with general principles of software engineering that students can learn to appreciate and apply early in the program (e.g., \"Be familiar with the reasons it is important that software be 'correct', i.e., why 'good enough' is not good enough when it comes to software quality\"). CSE 321: [Related SOs/PEOs: (a), (e), (m); I, II; assessment instruments: POCAT] One of the main goals of the 221-222-321 sequence is to ensure that students are able to use simple formal logic assertions involving mathematical set models to understand and reason about an operation's behavior. Students typically take CSE 321 and Math 366, the first discrete math course, during the same quarter. A major outcome of Math 366 is developing facility with manipulating logical assertions. Our expectation is that the activities in Math 366 would help strengthen the lessons of the 221-sequence. We discovered, however, via a POCAT question that, in fact, this was not happening. Students do not seem to transfer ideas from one context to another even when they are closely related. Here are some details. In the 221-sequence, in order to make them easily machine readable and writable, the notation that is used to write logic assertions spells out operators as, for example, \"there exists\" and \"union\"; whereas in Math 366, traditional math symbols are used. The faculty involved with the 221-sequence had designed a POCAT question that tested students ability to manipulate simple logic assertions involving properties of small sets of numbers. When the question was typeset for the POCAT, the person doing so, not being regularly involved with the 221-sequence, replaced the spelled out operators in the assertions that appeared in the question with their traditional math symbols. When UGSC discussed the test results after the test had been administered, there was concern that the performance of students on the question was much poorer than expected; only about 35% of the students had answered the question correctly as against the expected 70%. Various possible explanations were discussed until the faculty member who had suggested the question for inclusion in POCAT noticed the difference in notation used. He then hypothesized that the poor performance was at least partly due to this difference in notation; and that although students had seen and used the traditional math notation in Math 366, their not using that notation in the context of specifying/reasoning about program behavior, likely had a major impact on their performance. And indeed, when the question was rewritten to use the 221-notation in the next POCAT, student performance was close to 70%. To further clinch this issue, in the following POCAT, students taking the test were split into two groups (as it turned out, over 60 students took the test during this following quarter (as against the usual 25), allowing us to split them into two groups). One group was given the question using the 221-notation, the other using the traditional math notation. And, indeed, the results were as predicted: the performance of the second group was much poorer than that of the first group. This suggested a possible improvement in the sequence. The point is that students, by the time they graduate (which is close to when they take the POCAT) and become computing professionals, need to be able to go back and forth between the traditional math notation and other notations such as that used in the 221-sequence. Otherwise, their ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems, and, especially, their ability to understand others' formulations of engineering problems, will be limited. Hence we have been experimenting with a new activity in 321. In this activity, the instructor engages students in translating specifications of reasonably simple behaviors written in one notation to the other, in both directions; and assigns exercises in which students perform the translation as well. When students in a section of the course which included this activity and the idea discussed explicitly in a lecture were tested on this type of problem, their performance did not depend on the notation used; in another section of the course in which the relation between the two notations were only mentioned in passing in class and students were not engaged in actual translation from one notation to the other, the performance was poorer (while still being better than in POCAT). We are currently considering how best to ensure that not only are students in 321 able to go back and forth between these notations but that they retain the abilities over the long term. Pointers in Systems I course*: [Related SOs/PEOs: (c), (e), (k), (n); I; assessment instrument: Exit Survey] (Note: As mentioned earlier, items marked with \"*\" are still being discussed or are in the process of being implemented.) One observation that faculty teaching courses such as CSE 660 and CSE 677 have made over the years is that students' facility with pointers was somewhat lacking. A number of graduating students have also noted, in comments made as part of their exit surveys, that while the program does a good job of helping develop students' high-level/abstract skills, many students are not comfortable working at low-/systems-level, specifically when working with pointers. Hence in designing CSE 2421, Systems I, the semester replacement for CSE 360, faculty decided to include, as a key component, material that would directly address this weakness. Indeed, the title of the new course (\"Low-level programming and computer organization\") reflects this. The first part of this course will help develop students' abilities with C programming, including pointer manipulation. Since the other part of the course is computer organization, there will be a natural relation between the two parts and students should be able to not only develop their pointer-based programming skills but also their understanding of the relation to machine-level considerations. As we transition to semesters, we will try to track student performance to see if there is a noticeable difference in such courses as CSE 3461 (the replacement for CSE 677) depending on whether the student took CSE 360 or the new Systems I course. In some cases, can claim actual improvement due to changes: for \nexample, items 8 (222), 9 (560), 11 in list. --> CSE 321: [Related SOs/PEOs: (a, c, e, k, l, n); I; assessment instruments: other] A couple of years ago, the 221-222-321 sequence was reorganized to free up the last 2-3 weeks of CSE 321 so that students could engage in the design and implementation from scratch of a new abstract component that they use in an interesting case study (to generate tag clouds web pages). The design of the new abstract component is done though several homeworks and in-class activities to provide incremental and timely feedback and allow students to complete the design in a reasonable amount of time. This change was prompted by feedback from students and instructors in CSE 560. The feedback showed that the gap between 321 and 560 was substantial enough to create real issues for students in 560. One key concern was the lack of experience in designing new components from scratch. The new activity in 321 seems to have helped address this problem and also enables students, near the end of the CSE 221-222-321 sequence, to look back over the sequence and gain a summary understanding of the component-based approach to software design that the sequence is focused on. CSE 459.24, 459.xx*: [Related SOs/PEOs: (i, k); I; assessment instruments: Exit Survey] [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] One of the points that comes up frequently in the Exit Survey (as well as in the Alumni Survey) is that while the program provides students with excellent grounding in foundational ideas, it is somewhat lacking when it comes to helping students acquire experience with the most recent software tools. The CSE~459 courses are meant to address this concern, enabling students to explore a programming language that they may not otherwise enounter in the curriculum. One of the recent languages that has acquired importance in industry is C# . Hence CSE 459.24 was developed about three years ago that allows students to develop some skills in the language. It has been offered regularly since then. (This is related not just to outcome (k) but also (i) since it encourages students to explore, on their own, the various toolkits and libraries etc. that have developed around the language.) Another 459, this one on Python , is currently being planned. While this language has been around for some time, its importance in practical applications such as building GUIs has gone up significantly recently, in part because of the numerous, powerful Python libraries that have become available. In recent UG forums and Exit Surveys, students have expressed interest in learning Python. Recently, a senior graduate student (who has used Python extensively in building systems for his research) teamed up with a faculty member to propose developing a Python course in the 459 series. After discussion in the Curriculum Committee, the proposal has been approved and the course will be offered in Winter '12; assuming that the pilot offering goes as well as it is expected to, a semester version of the course will be developed and offered starting in the 2012-'13 year. CSE 541: [Related SOs/PEOs: (a, e); I; assessment instruments: other] Many students struggle through this course on numerical analysis . The problem is that they have not adequately understood the necessary ideas from the prerequisite courses on calculus, nor developed adequate skills to work with typical real-valued functions and this is reflected in their poor performance in 541. To address this, faculty made the following changes: i) introduced additional lectures at the start of the course reviewing relevant parts of calculus and introducing relevant material from basic linear algebra; ii) room for these topics was made by omitting lesser priority topics (such as Lagrangian interpolation). Student performance in the course has improved following these changes. CSE 551: [Related SOs/PEOs: (k, n); I; assessment instruments: UG Forum] In a recent offering of 551, one of the main assignments required the student to conduct a broad survey of the field and write a 3-5 page paper and make a brief in-class presentation reporting the findings. Alternately, students could build a simple application related to information security for a mobile handset. Microsoft Research had loaned us several Windows Phone 7 phones; and students who chose this latter option implemented their application on these phones. At a recent UG Forum, a couple of students suggested that focusing on one platform in this manner was not appropriate. In response to this, the instructor allowed students in the class to choose to develop the application on their own handset on any platform they preferred. In addition, the instructor is exploring the possibility of acquiring a few additional handsets on alternative platforms so that students in future offerings of the course will be able to develop on non-Windows platform even if they did not own an appropriate handset. CSE 601*: [Related SOs/PEOs: (f); III; assessment instruments: POCAT] [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] One of the questions on recent POCATs was the following: Conflict of interest is a common ethical issue in business. Which of the following has the most potential for being a conflict of interest? Recommending your company buy the same kind of computer you have at home; Recommending your company buy computers from your brother-in-law; Buying a computer for home use from the same supplier your company uses; Asking questions of the computer support people at work about programs you're using at home. Almost 90% of the students picked the correct answer, i.e., (2). But in the UGSC discussion of the results, the point was made that the question was too simple and did not adequately address outcome (f). For example, one common difficulty students have is distinguishing between legal questions versus ethical questions, or obligation to an employer versus obligation toward society, etc. Following the discussion, the faculty involved came up with a new question: Your brother/sister is very ill and needs medication you cannot afford, so you steal it. Which of the following is the ethical question that arises in this scenario? What kind of illness does your sibling have and how do we prevent its spread among populations? Why is the medication not affordable and how do we make it more affordable? Is it ever right to steal, even if you have a great need? What consequences might you face if you were caught stealing the medication? All of the above are ethical questions. All of the above are important but none of them is an ethical question. I cannot decide based on the given information. Only about 70% of the students picked (3), the right answer. In response, faculty are currently considering adding a lecture at the start of the course that explicitly considers the distinctions of the kind described above. Faculty are also analyzing student answers more carefully to see which of the various distractors seemed most popular to see what items to focus on in this lecture. CSE 655: [Related SOs/PEOs: (c, e, k); I; assessment instruments: POCAT] A common problem that programs, especially large ones, exhibit has to do with uninitialized variables. Different programming languages help address the problem in different ways. First, the language could be so designed that when a variable is defined, it is automatically assigned some appropriate default value. Or the syntax of the language could prevent the programmer from introducing a new variable without specifying an initial value for it. Or have the compiler analyze each program to check that each variable has been initialized before it is used. A fourth approach would be to have the compiler insert, into the compiled code, additional checks that make sure (at runtime) that each variable that is used has a value that was actually assigned to it. The last approach would be to do nothing and expect the programmer not to make the mistake of using a variable without initializing it; in this case, if the program does have an uninitialized variable, the program will probably crash when the compiled code is actually executed. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the first approach may mask a bug in the program because the programmer may have meant to but forgot to assign a specific initial value to a variable; since the system provides a default initial value, the program will run but may compute a wrong result and the programmer may not realize that. The third approach (compiler detecting the problem at compile time) but it can't be implemented in general because of conditional and loop structures that depend on runtime values. In other words, the compiler cannot tell exactly which parts of the program will be executed before which other parts. But it can do an approximate analysis and arrive at a conservative evaluation that would flag some uses of certain variables as questionable because it is not able to conclusively establish that, in all cases, during program execution, that the variable in question will be initialized before being used. Java uses this approach. C++ uses the fifth approach (leave it to the programmer); Resolve-C++, a local dialect of C++ that is used in the 221-sequence uses the first approach. The topic is discussed in some depth in CSE 655 but for some students the essential nature of the problem and its possible solutions tend to remain unclear. Here is a related POCAT question: One common problem in programs is that of uninitialized variables , i.e., using a variable without having initialized it. This is commonly a run-time error but Java flags this error at compile time. How does it do this? Java uses a special technology that converts run-time errors into compile-time errors; Java uses a \"conservative\" approach, sometimes flagging situations which are not actually erroneous; Java does automatic initialization of all variables so the problem of uninitialized variables cannot arise in Java programs; Java is an interpreted language, so this question is meaningless; I have no idea. When the question was tried a couple of years ago, faculty expected 70% or so of the students to get the correct answer. In fact, the number of students who picked the right answer was substantially less. While some of the students seem to have chosen an answer (such as (3)) that would indicate not having knowledge of some Java details, many others chose answers (such as (1)) that indicated failure to have a sufficiently good grasp of this important concept. Indeed, someone with a good understanding of the concept should, even if she had not heard of Java before, be able to choose (2) as the most likely answer. Based on this, the faculty revised the discussion in CSE 655 to include a more detailed discussion of the topic. The performance of students in recent offerings of POCAT in this (and similar) questions has been substantially better. CSE 670*: [Related SOs/PEOs: (a, e, m); I; assessment instruments: POCAT] [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] Relational schema and, in particular, the notion of primary keys for given schema, is a conceptually important notion discussed in CSE 670, the required course on databases. In order to see how well students are able to work with this notion at the time of their graduation, faculty designed the following POCAT question: Consider the relational schema R(A,B,C,D,E,F) with the functional dependencies: {BC --> ADEF, B --> DF, D --> EB} Which of the following could be the primary key for R: {A,B} {B} {C} {C, D} {B,C,D} None of the above I have no idea (1) is incorrect because although using B we can get D and F and then get E, there is no way to get to C. (2) is incorrect because we can't get to either C or A. (3) is incorrect because using C we can't reach any of the others. (4) is the right answer: using D, we can get E and B, and then using B and C, we can get to the rest. (5) does let us get to all the rest but is not minimal (since we can omit B). Surprisingly few students (less than 10%) got the correct answer on the POCAT. After some discussion in UGSC, it was decided that we should try a simpler version of the question. Consider the relational schema R(A,B,C,D) with the functional dependencies: {A --> BCD, BC --> AD, B --> D, D --> B} Which of the following could be the primary key for R: {A,B} {B} {C} {C, D} {B,C,D} None of the above I have no idea Again the right answer is (4); but again very few students got it. Following further discussion in UGSC, it was decided to request one of the 670 instructors to try the question in his final exam. The Sp '11 instructor for the course did so, assigning the first version of the question to half the students in the class and the second version to the other half. To his surprise, the performance of the students was as poor as in POCAT. Overall, less than 10% of the students (about the same figure as in POCAT) got the correct answer for either form of the question. The preliminary conjecture is that students are not understanding the minimality requirement of primary keys since several students chose answer (5). But we plan to look into this further and see how to revise the course to address the problem. CSE 680*: [Related SOs/PEOs: (a, b, e, l, m); II; assessment instruments: POCAT] [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] One of the topics in CSE 680, the required course on algorithms, is solving recurrence relations . These relations can be used to express the running time of certain algorithms; in effect the running time of the algorithm for input of a certain size is related to the running time for input of a smaller size; which, in turn is related to the running time for input of still smaller size; etc. But getting a good feel for the actual running time of such an algorithm for large inputs requires us to \"solve\" the relation to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm. In general, this is a difficult task but if certain conditions are satisfied, the Master theorem can simplify it considerably. This can be important in certain situations such as when dealing with algorithms designed to search through very large volumes of data since the difference in running time between different algorithms for the task can be very substantial. Hence the faculty involved with 680 designed a POCAT question intended to see if students are able to solve (reasonably simple) recurrence relations. The performance of the students who took the test was unexpectedly poor. In the evaluation discussion analyzing the test results, one explanation offered was that students were, in fact, capable of using the Master theorem to solve the relation --the relation in the POCAT question being one that satisfied the conditions that allow the Master theorem to be applied-- but that, because of the complex nature of those conditions, students could not be expected to remember them when taking the POCAT. Indeed, this seemed to be confirmed when the CSE 680 instructor asked a similar question as part of his final examination for the course. A large majority of the students in the course answered the final exam question correctly. But we decided to test this further. In the next offering of POCAT, the question was revised to include a statement of the theorem. With this, we felt students should be able to check that the needed conditions were satisfied in the given scenario and solve the specified recurrence relation. But, in fact, student performance wazs no better. This is a puzzle and one that has not yet been resolved. Why did the students in the course final examination do so well when students taking the POCAT did so poorly even when they were provided an explanation of the Master theorem? Further fine-tuning of the question in future offerings of the POCAT will, we hope, help address the question and tell us whether and what changes in the course are needed. It may also be worth noting that, in practice, one would expect a CSE professional to look up, perhaps on-line, the details of the theorem rather than necessarily remember them. Thus if the faculty's original explanation that students taking the POCAT simply did not remember the theorem had turned out to be correct, we would have concluded that no change in the course was called for. But it didn't. CSE 682: [Related SOs/PEOs: (d); I; assessment instruments: teamwork rubric] Based on the results of the peer-evaluations, using the teamwork rubric, in a recent offering of CSE 682, it is clear that some students have problems being good team members. The evaluations provided 3 example sets of comments by others in the group about individuals who did not function well on the team. In one case, comments made by the student about himself show how out of touch he was with the rest of the group. The instructor is planning to put these on slides and make a mini-lecture out of them for use in future offerings of the course. Previously, he has talked in class about good team participation but having such specific real examples (with the names of the individuals being elided, of course) should make the point much clearer. CSE 786: [Related SOs/PEOs: (d, i, k); I; assessment instruments: teamwork rubric, life-long learning paper rubric] Each capstone design course has required students to explore a new tool, technology, or process and write a three or four page paper on it. However, the coordinator for CSE 786 (the capstone course on game design) felt that this requirement was too distracting for students since it took too much of their focus away from the capstone design project. Hence he came up with an alternative approach to achieving the outcome via an activity related to the design project and, as an added bonus, also engaging students in another team activity. The approach is to require groups of several students each to form \"technology teams\". These teams are \"orthogonal\" to the project teams; i.e., typically each technology team of, say, 5 students, will consist of one student from each of five different project teams. Each technology team will focus on a particular relevant (to the area of the particular course) topic, for example, \"sound production\" or \"physics of games\" (these being relevant to the topic of CSE 786); each student in the team is responsible for one aspect of the particular topic and is expected to research that aspect. The team then puts together appropriate resources and/or documentation that summarizes its findings and makes a presentation to the entire class, with each student taking the lead for the particular aspect that he/she was responsible for. The document becomes a resource that is available to the entire class and helps address (or provides pointers to resources that may address) questions related to the particular topic that different project teams may encounter in their projects. Thus the approach helps students improves their lifelong learning skills; and since the student teams are required to document and present their findings, it helps sharpen their communication skills as well. Further, since the research and, especially, creating the document and making the presentation are both team activities, and since the team is distinct from the student's project team thus requiring the student to interact closely with another group of students, the approach contributes to improving students' team skills. Moreover, since the topic is directly relevant to the design projects that the various project teams in the course are engaged in, the interaction between the technology team and the class during the presentation is likely to be more engaging and of greater depth. Other capstone design courses (such as CSE 682) are adopting the approach to their courses. CSE 2221, 2231 (the semester replacements for CSE 221-222-321): [Related SOs/PEOs: (m, k); I; assessment instruments: Alumni and Exit Surveys] One comment that we have often seen in the Exit and Alumni Surveys is that while students and graduates appreciated the software engineering discipline that the CSE 221-sequence teaches, many are unsatisfied with the use of RESOLVE/C++ in the sequence. Many would prefer to learn the concepts we teach in this sequence with a different programming language as the delivery mechanism, a language used more commonly in industry positions of the sort they are most likely to secure for internships and after graduation. Hence, in the semester version of the sequence, the conceptual focus of the introductory software courses will remain, but we will use Java as the programming language and focus more attention on current industry best practices, much as we do now in CSE 421. CSE 3901, 3902 (semester replacements for CSE 560): [Related SOs/PEOs: (c, e, k, l, n); I; assessment instruments: Alumni and Exit Surveys] One of the comments we consistently see in the Exit and Alumni Surveys is that CSE 560, the current junior level project course, is extremely valuable since it helps students develop teamworking as well as communication skills while also, at the same, engaging them in a challenging design and development task. The one negative comment that we see has been with respect to the domain of the task, i.e., system software (assembler, linker, loader, simulator). While understanding of such software is important, especially for those who want to work, for example, in embedded systems development and the like, most students feel that it should not be the topic of the project in 560. In designing the semeter program, we have, therefore, developed two courses, CSE 3901 and 3902, each of which can be used to meet the junior-level project course requirement. The project in CSE 3901 is concerned with development of a web application with the focus on both client-side and server-side scripting. The project in CSE 3902 is concerned with development of a 2-d interactive game with the focus on both 2-d graphics and rendering as well as on event-based programming. Each course will, as does the current 560, engage students in intensive team work as well as documentation/communication. E.2 Program-level Improvements NEWPATH: [Related SOs/PEOs: (d, g, k); I; assessment instruments: Alumni and Exit Surveys] Many BS-CSE majors have a strong interest in entrepreneurship and dream of being successful entrepreneurs. Indeed, many of these students gravitated to CSE because of their interest in entrepreneurship. The university does offer, in the Fisher College of Business, a minor program in the topic and a number of students do complete that program. However, several comments over the years in alumni surveys and exit surveys have suggested that a more focused program, one that concerns not entrepreneurship in general but IT-entrepreneurship would be of value. Partly in response to this, and partly because NSF funding made it possible, the NEWPATH program was created four years ago with the main goal of educating, training and nurturing highly motivated students to become IT entrepreneurs. The most ambitious students in the program are expected, by the time of graduation, to be running their own IT startups. The program has a number of key components: internships in local IT-startups, arranged in collaboration with TechColumbus, a state supported non-profit that serves as an incubator for high-tech startups; an on-going weekly seminar session that provides a forum in which students can learn from each other and from NEWPATH faculty members, can brainstorm ideas that may serve as the basis for startups, can hear from other students about their internship and e-practicum experiences, can engage in case-studies of successful and unsuccessful IT startups to identify best (and not so good) practices, and can hear from CEOs and other senior people from local IT startups; and a two-quarter long entrepreneurship practicum. This component is designed to provide an in-depth practical experience in IT entrepreneurship to NEWPATH students where they will have the opportunity to take an idea from concept to the brink of commercialization. The program has proven popular with a select group of motivated BS-CSE majors as well as majors from ECE, Business, etc. The availability of this activity contributes to several of the student outcomes including (d), ability to function on multidisciplinary teams; (g), communicate effectively with a range of audiences; and (k), ability to use techniques and skills (including, especially, entrepreneurial skills) to succeed as a CSE professional and entrepreneur. GET: [Related SOs/PEOs: I; assessment instruments: Alumni and Exit Surveys, IAB meetings] Another common refrain in the Alumni Survey over the years, has been the importance of providing opportunities for students to gain, via suitable internships, relevant work experience while they are still in the program. Comments at some IAB meetings have echoed this. Many of our students, out of necessity, work at least part-time but that work is often unrelated to CSE and does not address this need. The Global Enterprise Technology (GET) Immersion Experience is designed to do so. It is an ``immersive internship program'' for BS-CSE (and BS-CIS) majors, designed in cooperation with JP Morgan Chase and Syracuse University. Students admitted to the program engage in a 2-quarter+summer long on-site internship at JP Morgan Chase or other companies, while being fully enrolled in classes that are tightly woven into this internship. Students who have gone through the program will gain valuable, relevant work experience, and can also expect to receive permanent job offers from JP Morgan Chase and associated companies when they complete their degrees. The program is in its pilot state and has already attracted considerable student interest. This improvement directly contributes to preparing the student to achieve the first part of program objective (I), i.e., graduates of the program will be employed in the computing profession, ... Chemistry, ECE courses, (but explain it as an opportunity to improve \ncomputing, focus on ECE that is directly computing-related?) (alum survey,\nexit survey) (PEO I?) structure of options (forum, exit survey, alum survey) (peo I, II) GET program (alum survey, exit survey; PEO I) Intro of ethics course (based on alum survey) (outcome (f)) (SS)--> Ethics Course: [Related SOs/PEOs: (f); III; assessment instruments: Alumni Surveys] The alumni survey as well as informal interactions with alumni and employers has made clear the need for students (engineering students in general, not just BS-CSE majors) to receive training in topics related to engineering ethics in a full-fledged course. In response to this data, the College of Engineering's Core Committee worked to achieve two things: replace one of the general education courses by a course devoted to this topic; and have various departments around the university develop suitable courses that engineering students could take. The committee defined the set of learning outcomes that any course in this category should achieve: An ability to explain the ways in which society regulates the use of technology; An ability to identify stakeholders in an engineering solution; An ability to identify moral problems and dilemmas; An ability to analyze moral problems from different ethical perspectives; An ability to identify the personal values that an individual holds and uses to resolve moral problems and dilemmas; An ability to describe the relation between personal values, societal values, and professional values. Four different courses have been developed and approved for this category with the majority of students taking Philosophy 131.01, Introduction to Engineering Ethics . This course is an introduction to engineering ethics, and stresses the application of professional ethical codes to specific cases. The focus is on the National Society of Professional Engineer's (NSPE) ethical code but the course also looks at the professional codes of other professional engineering organizations. In addition, the course briefly surveys some of the major ethical theories that have been proposed and discusses the general relationship between advancing technology and society's ethical standards. The addition of the engineering ethics course to the curricula of BS-CSE majors who entered the university in the last few years is an important improvement that contributes to outcome (f), in particular student's understanding of professional, ethical, legal, and social issues and responsiblities. Change in PEO II, III*: [Related SOs/PEOs: II, III; assessment instruments: IAB input] [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] During its May 2011, the Industrial Advisory Board, during its periodic discussion of the BS-CSE program, suggested a couple of (modest) revisions to the current PEOs. The first suggestion was to revise PEO (III) which currently reads, \"Graduates will be informed and involved members of their communities, and responsible engineering and computing professionals\", to refer to professional societies (such as ACM) rather than or, possibly, in addition to \"communities\". The second suggestion was to consider dropping the word \"computing\" from PEO (II) which currently reads, \"Graduates with an interest in, and aptitude for, advanced studies in computing will have completed, or be actively pursuing, graduate studies in computing\", to account for graduates who may pursue, for example, an MBA. We will discuss these suggestions in early Autumn 2011 in the UGSC for possible action. E.3 Improvements in Assessment/Evaluation Processes Quality of POCAT questions*: [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] In the earlier discussion of CSE 601 , we noted that the original POCAT question was too simple and that was the reason for the relatively high scores that students received. But this raises a general question: is there a way to evaluate the quality of POCAT questions in general? One obvious measure is the difficulty of the question, i.e., the percentage of students who choose the right answer. But there is a more nuanced measure that we have been considering, one that is based on a similar measure used elsewhere. The idea is that since wrong answers in a POCAT question are not simply arbitrary wrong answers but are supposed to represent common misconceptions that students harbor, for each answer X of a question, one can define its discrimination , disc as follows: disc = (Xt/Nt) - (Xb/Nb) where Xt is the number of students from the top quartile who selected the answer X and Nt the number of students in the top quartile; Xb the number of students from the bottom quartile who selected X and Nb the number of students in the bottom quartile. One expects a high-quality question to have a correct response with a large positive disc value. Similarly, a good distractor (ie incorrect response) for such a question would have a large negative disc value. Thus disc provides a good way to evaluate the quality of a POCAT question not just in terms of its difficulty but also with respect to the quality of the distractors in it. This is important since good distractors allow us to identify common misconceptions that students harbor which allow us come up with improvements in the courses to help overcome the misconceptions. Hence we are revising the automated tool that generates the summary results so that it computes all the  disc values and highlight those that are out of line. Having these values (computed by hand) available during the UGSC discussion of the POCAT results has already proven very useful in helping to guide the evaluation. Evaluation and documentation of POCAT results: Each quarter, one key activity for UGSC is arranging the POCAT and creating the test that will be used. In the first or second week of the quarter, committee members discuss this briefly, decide a date for the test, and discuss the questions that should be used on the test, based on the results from previous tests. The summary results of the POCAT are compiled within a week of the test administration. At the following UGSC meeting, the results are evaluated and the conclusions summarized in the minutes of the meeting. While this approach has worked, the evaluation is buried in the UGSC minutes. Hence, when subsequent POCAT results are discussed, faculty's recollection of the previous evaluations tends to be somewhat hazy. In order to address this, we have now adopted the following approach. For each question for which the results were unexpected or otherwise led to discussions in the Undergraduate Committee (and beyond), summaries of the discussion are written up. The summaries are similar to the ones above (for CSE 321, 601, 655, 670, etc.). The summaries are maintained in a single web page in reverse chronological order with the summaries corresponding to the each POCAT being organized in its own section. Each of these sections also contains a link to the actual question used in that particular POCAT. In effect, over time, the page provides a historical view of the changes that were made to the program and the rationale, in terms of the assessment results that triggered them and the summary evaluations of the results, behind the changes. Thus, for example, a new faculty member to the department can read through this page and get an excellent view of the evolution of the program and the reasons behind important changes in the program. (This page is protected since it contains links to banks of POCAT questions as well as the tests.) Rubric for interactive grading in CSE 560*: [This item is still being discussed/in the process of being implemented.] A major activity in CSE 560 is the quarter-long team project which requires student teams (typically of 4 or 5 students each) to design, implement, test, and document a system project (consisting of an assembler, loader, simulator, etc.) One key component of the assessment of student work in the course is a set of interactive grading sessions in which student teams have to demonstrate parts of their system to the instructor and the grader and answer questions about various aspects of the system and their design. One of the difficulties of any team project of this kind, especially at this stage in the students' curriculum, is ensuring that each member of the team contributes appropriately to each important piece of the effort. For example, it is not uncommon for one student in a team, someone who has been programming for a long time, the proverbial \"hacker\", to take over all implementation aspects of the project. The interactive grading sessions often reveal such problems. But students may not always know what to expect of these sessions or their purpose. Our plan is to develop a grading rubric that will be used during these sessions and make the rubric available to the students at the start of the quarter so that they can see what potential problems to look out for in their own teams. Thus the idea is not just to make the grading task more clearly defined but to help students recognize, as they are working on their projects, common problems that teamwork engenders and take corrective action in time. Proposed rubric for 560 (to be developed) (outcomes (c), (d), (e), (k), (n)) Please send comments, questions, and suggestions to Neelam at cse.ohio-state.edu (Previous (now outdated) version of this page is here ; and an even older version is here .)

    "text_content": "Proposed Focus Areas | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Proposed Focus Areas Proposed Focus Areas This has now been approved. A page describing the details of the new focus areas has been added to the program website. Under quarters, students in the CSE and CIS programs had to choose a tech elective option, one of software systems, information systems, information and computation assurance, advanced studies, hardware/software, or the individualized option. Each option (other than the last one) required students to complete a set of required courses and complete an additional set of elective courses; the individualized option allowed students to tailor, in consultation with their advisors, an appropriate set of elective courses based on their specific interests. Under semesters, the requirements are simply that students must complete 15 cr hours of tech elective courses (of which at least 8 cr hrs must be CSE courses) (in other words, essentially the individualized option of the quarter system). While this allows for flexibility, the disadvantage is that students with interest in a specific area do not have a predefined list of courses that would be appropriate as tech electives, given their interest. They can, of course, talk to their advisors and other students and come up with their own lists, but this is somewhat of a hit-or-miss approach. So UGSC has developed a set of eight focus areas that students can choose from. For each focus area, UGSC has identified, based on input from faculty, three sets of courses. The first set consists of courses that are, in some sense, central or essential to the area. The second set consists of courses that are directly related to the area and further develop the area or deal with important problems that can be addressed using techniques from the area, etc. The third set consists of courses that may be related to the area but perhaps somewhat less directly, or courses that introduce ideas and techniques that may be of value as background material that may help the student as he or she gets more deeply into the focus area, etc. This table lists the eight areas and, for each one, lists the courses related to each area. The courses in the first set for each area are flagged \"xxx\" in the table; the courses in the second set are flagged \"xx\"; the courses in the third set are flagged \"x\". The intent is that a student who chooses a particular focus area should complete all of the courses marked \"xxx\" for that area; as many as possible of the courses marked \"xx\"; and consider taking some of the courses marked \"x\". A few important points: Students have to complete, in addition to 15 hours of tech electives, a project course (one of 3901, 3902, 3903); four core choice courses (one from each of four specified pairs of courses, one pair being, e.g., 3521 (AI 1) and 3541 (Game and animation techniques); and a capstone design course (one of five specified courses). For each of the proposed focus areas, several of the courses in each of the corresponding three sets can be counted toward these requirements. Thus students who want to follow a particular focus area should be easily able to complete all or almost all of the courses that are included in the particular focus area. Some of the focus areas include Calculus III and/or Stat 4201. For CSE majors, Calculus III can be used as the as math/science elective that they have to complete; and Stat 4201 can be used in place of Stat 3470 which they would not have to take. For CIS majors, there is no additional math/science elective so Calc III would have to be used as a tech elective; but Stat 4201 can be used in place of Stat 3470 which they would not have to take. Students would not have to choose a focus area. These are just guidelines to help students interested in particular areas to choose courses most appropriate for the area. Students who choose a particular focus area can, if they so choose, abandon it in favor of another area or no area at all; and they can also pursue more than one area. Students who complete a given focus area will not receive a notation to that effect on their transcripts. That may change at some point in the future if, depending on acceptance of this by students, we decide to get approval of these from higher levels of the university. Request : Please take a look at the details of the areas and the courses proposed to be included in each as summarized in this table and email any comments you may have to neelam AT cse Support CSE $50,000 for the 50th Donate to the department to help us reach the goal of $50,000 in donations to celebrate over 50 years of teaching excellence Click here to make your donation.

The current set is available elsewhere .] Background : The set of outcomes listed below was approved by the CSE faculty on Feb. 20, 2006. This is a revision from the previous set of and outcomes which are available on-line . The main change was to replace the set of outcomes by a new set that closely matched the EAC Criterion 3 outcomes. No changes were made in the program's objectives. This change was arrived at after extensive discussions in the CSE Undergraduate Studies Committee (UGSC), in the undergraduate forum on Feb. 13, '06, posts on student newsgroups, and in the faculty meeting. [It is also worth noting that, currently, CAC (the Computing Accreditation Commission) is in the process of proposing outcomes similar to EAC Criterion 3 outcomes. If CAC adopts such outcomes, we will further revise the outcomes below to ensure that they include both the EAC as well as the CAC outcomes.] Preamble In this document, the term Objective denotes, as specified in the (revised) EC 2000 Criteria (see ABET web site ), the expected accomplishments of graduates of the program during the several years following graduation. Outcomes , again as specified by EC 2000, are statements that describe what students are expected to know or be able to do by the time of graduation from the program. (Achievement of the outcomes should \"foster attainment of the objectives\".) There are five objectives, numbered (I) through (V). There are eleven outcomes, numbered (a) through (k) [to parallel the EAC outcomes (3.a) through (3.k)]. CSE Program Objectives The objectives of the CSE program are: Graduates will have a thorough grounding in the key principles and practices of computing, and will have applied their software development skills and knowledge of foundational principles to the design and implementation of practical systems consisting of software and/or hardware components to meet customer requirements.

    "text_content": "Intellectual Property | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Intellectual Property Intellectual Property One question that came up in discussions among NEWPATH students and faculty related to intellectual property (IP); and whether OSU would make any claims on ventures that NEWPATH students might create. The NEWPATH team has discussed this question with the OSU IP office and obtained their assurance that, given the nature of the NEWPATH program, OSU will not make such claims. Specifically, the IP office has assured us that: The University would not claim rights in the work product/intellectual property of NEWPATH students unless any of the following apply: the work is based upon existing OSU intellectual property (I.e. background IP); the work is dependent upon other current (or future) sponsored research programs elsewhere in the institution; a faculty member steps out of their mentoring role, and they themselves make an inventive contribution (i.e. are a named inventor on a patent relating to the work); significant University resources and/or personnel, other than the students, are used to create the work (e.g. 100's of hours of supercomputing time, repeated use of core laboratory facilities or shops, hosting on OSU servers, extensive graphic design services by departmental staff, etc.) If any of the above are/become applicable, we should revisit the matter for that particular situation. (Note: Though the situation should be reviewed, even then a license from OSU may not be required.) Lastly, if an OSU faculty/staff member intends to be an owner/founder of any start-up in which the students are involved, then there may be issues as well which require further discussion.

    "text_content": "Books | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Books Books Note : The book \"descriptions\" are taken from reviews on Amazon. The One Page Business Plan (Horan, Peters) : The One Page Business Plan is an easy-to-use process that helps you capture your vision and translate it into concrete results. ... not only removes the mystique from business plans, but also leads you by the hand through crafting the best plan possible: clear, focused, understandable and concise. I consider the book to be a significant contribution to business literature. Bankable Business Plans (Rogoff, Bezos) : . . . a no-nonsense approach to putting in writing what lenders and investors demand to see. [This book] tells entrepreneurs exactly how to pull together what they need before they see the people with the money. Crossing the Chasm (Moore) : Moore makes the case that high-tech products require marketing strategies that differ from those in other industries. His chasm theory describes how high-tech products initially sell well, mainly to a technically literate customer base, but then hit a lull as marketing professionals try to cross the chasm to mainstream buyers. This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry. Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. Design Rules: The Power of Modularity (Baldwin, Clark) : Elegant Integration of Real Options and Complexity Thinking ... The authors clearly and persuasively explain how modular design adds a tremendous amount of value through the creation of real options. Furthermore, modularity allows for the evolution of both design and industry. High Tech Start Up (Nesheim) : You've got a hot idea for a new dot-com, and you're itching to join the folks who regularly show up on CNBC and at the Lexus dealerships in Silicon Valley. But you also know your odds of big-time success are about as long as Bill Gates's position in MSFT. What do you do? John Nesheim lays out the step-by-step skinny in High Tech Startup. The Black Swan (Taleb) : ... an entertaining and enlightening book ... the message: the world is governed not by the predictable and the average, but by the random, the unknownable, the unpredictable -- big events or discoveries or unusual people that have big consequences. Change comes not uniformly but in unpredictable spurts. These are the Black Swans of the title: completedly unexpected and rare events or novel ideas or technologies that have a huge impact on the world. Indeed, Taleb argues that history itself is primarly driven by these Black Swans. Blue Ocean Strategy (Kim, Mauborgne) : blue ocean metaphor elegantly summarizes their vision of the kind of expanding, competitor-free markets that innovative companies can navigate. Unlike \"red oceans,\" which are well explored and crowded with competitors, \"blue oceans\" represent \"untapped market space\" and the \"opportunity for highly profitable growth.\" The only reason more big companies don't set sail for them, they suggest, is that \"the dominant focus of strategy work over the past twenty-five years has been on competition-based red ocean strategies\"-i.e., finding new ways to cut costs and grow revenue by taking away market share from the competition. ... The Innovator's Solution (Christensen, Raynor) : ... analyzes the strategies that allow corporations to successfully grow new businesses and outpace the other players in the marketplace. Christensen's earlier book examined how focusing on profits can destroy even well-run corporations, while this book focuses on companies expanding by being \"disruptors\" who are able to outpace their entrenched competition. The Art of the Start (Kawasaki) : What does it take to turn ideas into action? What are the elements of a perfect pitch? How do you win the war for talent? How do you establish a brand without bucks? These are some of the issues everyone faces when starting or revitalizing any undertaking, and Guy Kawasaki, former marketing maven of Apple Computer, provides the answers. The Art of the Start will give you the essential steps to launch great products, services, and companies--whether you are dreaming of starting the next Microsoft or a not-for-profit that's going to change the world Hot, Flat, and Crowded (Friedman) : Friedman's bestseller \"The World Is Flat\" has helped millions of readers see the world in a new way. In this new book, Friedman takes a fresh and provocative look at two of the biggest challenges we face today: America's surprising loss of focus and national purpose since 9/11; and the global environmental crisis, which is affecting everything from food to fuel to forests. ... he shows us how the solutions to these two big problems are linked--how we can restore the world and revive America at the same time.

We are designing solutions for improved positioning of vehicles, developing mechanisms for accurate vehicle identification and designing systems for supporting safety-critical applications. The Smart-grid is the next generation of the power-grid that allows the integration of increasing intelligence into the operation of the power grid, both at the supply and demand ends. At the supply-end, renewable energy generation allows end-customers to also act as suppliers. At the demand-side, smart appliances provide new means of controlling the load exerted on the power grid within suitable range of flexibilities. Our overarching objective is to develop the analytical foundations and design tools required to build an efficient, reliable, and resilient \u00a0future electric grid. Hence, we are designing breakthrough control, market, and incentive regulation mechanisms to manage the unique dynamics and incentives of the smart grid. We are also investigating how networking elements of the smart-grid can be used to redistribute energy such that the end-user is lowered while maintaining a healthy competition among all suppliers. double-arrow Faculty Arora, Anish Distinguished Professor of Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering Chair, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 292-1836 arora.9@osu.edu Shroff, Ness Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communication, Electrical and Computer Engineering Ohio Eminent Scholar, Computer Science and Engineering Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Directory Categories Faculty Tenure-track (614) 247-6554 shroff.11@osu.edu Newsletter",

The study of quantitative and computational aspects of metric spaces and their embeddings is featured prominently in the study of problems arising when analyzing such massive data endowed with a geometric representation. These problems include similarity search, visualization, clustering, and data compression. Analytic and computational results in Metric Geometry offer crucial insights into the solution of these problems. The theory of Metric Embeddings provides an interface between mathematics, and computer science, leading to powerful new algorithmic methods in the above contexts. double-arrow Faculty Newsletter",

    "text_content": "FAQs | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home FAQs FAQs Questions from people who are not currently OSU students: Q: I work full-time and I am interested in taking some courses to get a basic knowledge of how to use computers. How do I take courses in the department? Ans: Probably the simplest approach would be for you to become a continuing education student at OSU. This will allow you to take courses offered by various OSU departments including this department. But note that CIS and CSE majors get priority scheduling for courses beyond CSE 2221 taught by the department. Other students are admitted on a space-available basis. Q: I have been a programmer/software developer for many years although I do not have an undergraduate degree in CS. I would like to get such a degree. What is the fastest way of doing so? Ans: There probably is no guaranteed quick way of getting such a degree, but there are different approaches. It is best to set up an appointment with an advisor to discuss the options you have. Please contact the Advising Office . You may also want to consider the possibility of getting into our graduate program . Q: I am a high-school senior and have been programming in C and C++ for 5 years. I am interested in becoming a professional video game software developer. How do I go about it? Ans: To become a good software engineer, whether it is in the field of video games or any other kind of software, a person needs a solid grounding in key concepts in programming and computing. Those concepts and skills are learned and developed in any of our bachelor degrees in the department. Note that mathematical skills and analytical thinking abilities are essential for success in software engineering; our programs, therefore, have a fairly strong math component as well. Q: I am a high-school senior and was planning to join OSU to major in one of the programs in this department. But I hear that all the IT jobs are going overseas. Should I change my plans? Ans: The philosophy of most career and academic counselors is to go for your passion. If you feel that computing is your passion, then go for it. There have been many studies that suggest the IT jobs are here to stay, but perhaps in a broader sector. And with the current state of the economy, the increase in job opportunities means companies will be starting to hire, and the IT sector will not produce enough students to fill necessary jobs. Some of the fastest-growing occupations nationally by percentage are IT related: Network system, data analysts, software engineers. And in the state of Ohio, various types of IT jobs were in the top 7 out of 10 jobs that are the fastest-growing occupations by percentage. Change your plans? Only you can answer that, but if you really enjoy computing, you should definitely consider pursuing a computing degree. Q: I am a student in University of XYZ. I want to transfer to Ohio State so I can work in computer animation. What should I do? Ans: If you are an undergraduate student, see the admissions page. If you are a graduate student, see the graduate program page. Q: I am a high-school senior and will be joining OSU in the fall. How long will it take for me to complete my CSE (or CIS) degree? Ans: Depends on a number of factors such as how many credit hours you will be taking each semester, how many/which prerequisite courses you might have to take at OSU, etc. In the past few years, the average time-to-degree for both BS CSE and BS CIS majors has been 4 to 5 years. BA CIS students typically take somewhat shorter time but the number of these students is so low that averages don't make sense.

BS CSE and BS CIS The BS CSE and the BS CIS programs prepare students for a range of careers in Computer Science. The Computer Science portion of these two programs are identical to each other. The main difference between the two is that the BS CSE requires more math, science, and engineering while the BS CIS requires more general education courses including a foreign language. BA CIS The BA CIS program through the College of Arts and Sciences, allows students considerable flexibility in tailoring the choice of courses, including Computer Science courses, according to their specific interests. This degree requires the student to identify a related field that offers a high potential for computing applications, and take several courses in the related field at both the introductory and advanced levels. This is offset by a somewhat lighter set of requirements in advanced computing courses. The General Education component of this program is similar to that of the BS CIS program.

How can we engineer \"machine listening\" systems that achieve this perceptual feat? For computers and humans to successfully interact using natural language, linguistic content from both speech and text signals is required. The research approach taken within the AI group is to mix algorithmic development for machine learning with insights from psychology, acoustics, and linguistics in order to find new ways of extracting speech from audio (as in computational audition above), word transcripts from speech (automatic speech recognition), and linguistic meaning from words (natural language processing). double-arrow Faculty Fosler-Lussier, Eric Professor, Computer Science and Engineering The John I.

    "text_content": "NEWPATH | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students NEWPATH NEWPATH Major and pre-major students in BS CSE, BS CIS, and BS ECE (Computer option) programs with interests in entrepreneurship will be recruited into the program. In addition to satisfying the requirements of their respective majors, NEWPATH students will complete the entrepreneurship minor; complete two internships in carefully selected IT companies; complete the culminating e-practicum in which they will take an idea from concept to the brink of commercialization; and, in the case of the most promising cases, especially the ones that attract interest of potential investors when the business cases are presented to them as part of the e-practicum, to create and run the startups. Internships Internships, especially in IT startups, is an important component of NEWPATH. TechColumbus' staff members will help place students in appropriate internship positions and will play a key role in assessing and guiding student teams in the e-practicum. Most importantly, TechColumbus will actively assist student teams in setting up and running the startups. Since startups may be strapped for cash, NSF-NEWPATH funds may be used, in such cases, to supplement or provide part of the salaries for students during their internship periods. Students who take up such internships, especially those whose internships are supported by NEWPATH funds, will be required to make a presentation, in the weekly seminar (see below) during the following quarter, about their internship experience. Internship supervisors of NEWPATH students whose internship was supported by NEWPATH funds will also be invited to make presentations in the weekly seminar; these presentations may be about their particular companies or may be on topics of general interest related to IT-entrepreneurship. Weekly Seminar A key part of the program is the weekly seminar. All NEWPATH students are expected to register for and regularly attend the 1-credit hour NEWPATH weekly seminar every quarter (except Summer). The intent of the seminar is to provide a forum in which students can learn from each other and from NEWPATH faculty members, can brainstorm ideas that may serve as the basis for startups, can hear from other students about their internship and e-practicum experiences, can engage in case-studies of successful and unsuccessful IT startups to identify best (and not so good) practices, and can hear from CEOs and other senior people from local IT startups. In addition, students, either individually or in teams of two or three, are encouraged to pursue individual research where they explore, in depth, some aspect of entrepreneurship such as effective approaches to identifying market opportunities, or to obtaining venture capital, or even exploring specific items of recent technology developments that may present entrepreneurial opportunities. Students pursuing such research will be eligible for scholarship support of up to $500 per semester. These students are required to make a presentation during the semester, reporting on the results of their research findings; in addition, they are required to submit a (3-5 page) paper by the end of the quarter that reports on the findings and accounts for feedback received during their presentation. Students who do not seem to be making progress in their research or fail to make a presentation and/or submit a paper are likely to have their scholarships suspended and will be ineligible for scholarship support until they are again actively participating in and contributing to the program. The seminar will meet every semester (other than Summer) on Mondays at 10:20-11:15am in DL 263. We are currently in the process of having a regular course number assigned for the seminar; for now, students should register for 1-cr hour of Dr. Soundarajan's section of CSE 4193, \"Independent Studies\". Regular attendance at the seminar and active participation are key to achieving the program's outcomes. Hence, every student is expected to attend the seminar regularly and participate actively. Failure to do so without prior consultation with the NEWPATH faculty may result in the student being suspended from the program. In some cases, it is recognized that a student may not be able to participate in the seminar for part of or even an entire semester. In such cases, the student should inform, by email, the NEWPATH faculty, no later than by the end of the first week of the quarter in question. Failure to do so will render the student ineligible for scholarship support and support for internship-salary and other program related activities for the next two quarters. Repeated failure to attend the seminar and failure to participate actively will result in the student being dropped from the program.

CSE Course Enrollment CSE Course Enrollment Majors If you are a pre-CSE/CIS or CSE/CIS major trying to enroll in a CSE course, please make sure you're doing the following: 1.\u00a0 If\u00a0searching for 5000-level courses , be sure to filter for \u201cundergraduate\u201d sections. In Class Search in SIS (BuckeyeLink), select \u201cUndergraduate\u201d in the Course Career field.\u202f\u202fIn Schedule Planner, select \u201cUndergraduate\u201d when prompted. SIS (BuckeyeLink) Example: Schedule Planner Example: 2. To find waitlist-only courses (all 5000 level and 3232) in SIS (BuckeyeLink) or Schedule Planner, you must uncheck the \u201cshow open classes only\u201d button when doing a Class Search in SIS, or if you are in Schedule Planner, you must change the Course Status to include waitlist courses. SIS (BuckeyeLink) Example: Schedule Planner Example: 3.\u00a0 To Waitlist a course; in BuckeyeLink when adding the courses to your shopping cart, you must make sure to check the \u201cadd to waitlist if class is full\u201d box when it comes up. Waitlist box example: 4. If you are searching with all options available and a course is still not showing up, then the course is not being offered. Special Notes * CSE 3232 and all 5000-Level CSE Courses (including Capstones): If you are planning to take CSE 3232 and/or a 5000-level course (including the capstones), you must waitlist it.\u00a0We are managing the enrollments in these courses due to the number of CSE and CIS graduating seniors who need these courses to complete degree requirements. *\u00a0Check prerequisites for the courses you want to take. Prerequisites for all CSE courses are being enforced.\u202f Courses with prerequisites CANNOT be taken concurrently with their prerequisites, and you will not be allowed to schedule or waitlist a course if you do not have credit for the prerequisite(s). Many courses numbered CSE 2331 and higher require being in the CSE or CIS major, or a related major such as Data Analytics.\u202f Students who have not been admitted to the designated major will not be able to schedule or waitlist the affected courses.\u202f PLAN ACCORDINGLY. An easy way to check prerequisites for CSE courses is through the CSE Course description website. Minors and Other Non-Majors If you are a non-CSE/CIS student trying to schedule a CSE course, please make sure you've done the following: Try to enroll in the course as normal. Try to waitlist the course by checking the \"waitlist if course is full\" box (even if the course isn't full). If none of the above work e-mail the CSE advising office with the semester, course number(s), class number(s), section number(s) and days/times that you are trying to add.

Cybersecurity Education - ICA Specialization Cybersecurity Education - ICA Specialization Background Ohio State is again designatined a National Center for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity education, a program managed by the NSA's National Cryptologic School, for 2024-2029. The main goal of this program is to identify accredited institutions around the country that provide programs suitable for training students for professional careers that address cybersecurity challenges in both government and business. The key requirements for being designated are, first and foremost, a suitable set of courses that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for such careers. In addition, the department and the university must also meet other criteria such as practicing appropriate cybersecurity procedures in their day-to-day operations. The complete list of currently approved CAE institutions is available on-line . The NSA requires institutions to go through recertification as CAE-designated institutions every 5 years. Our Program of Study (POS), the BS CSE degree with a Specialization in Information and Computation Assurance\u00a0(ICA), was approved in May 2022 and the\u00a0 NCAE-CD institutional designation again in June 2024. The related documents are available on-line although access is limited; please contact Dr. Zhiqiang Lin if needed. Information Assurance Scholarship Programs (IASP) Ohio State is one of three universities who make up the Midwest VICEROY Institute (MVI). Students need not be in the CSE program to apply for the MVI Scholars Program . This program provides tuition assitance for completing online (not for credit) training courses An important benefits of being designated as a CAE-CD institution is that we can nominate students (must be US citizens) for scholarships for the CAE institutions. The scholarships are quite generous, provide internship opportunities with the NSA and some require the student to make a commitment to work for a specified period of time after graduation. Over the last several years, a number of our students have received this scholarship. For information about opportunities with the NSA, please see NSA Student Programs . For additional information on current benefits available to students, please reach out to Julia Armstrong , Managing Dir. of ICDT. ICA Specialization Program-level Learning Outcomes (PLO) Students who pursue the Information and Computation Assurance option of the BS-CSE program will develop an ability to apply principles of computing and networking as well as relevant ideas of mathematics and statistics to address problems related to information assurance. develop an ability to design and conduct experiments on actual systems and analyze the results to draw conclusions about potential vulnerabilities in the system. develop an ability to communicate their findings in oral and written presentations to their peers as well as supervisors. These are in addition to the core BS CSE program educational objectives and outcomes . Curriculum CSE and CIS majors interested in information assurance and computer security should follow the Information and Computation Assurance specialization as it is aligned with the NCAE POS. The courses for this are as follows: Required courses: CSE 3241: Introduction to Database Systems (3 cr hrs) CSE 3461: Computer Network and Internet Technologies (3 cr hrs) CSE 3901: Project Design, Development, and Documentation of Web Applications (4 cr hrs) CSE 4471: Information Security (3 cr hrs) CSE 5473: Network Security (3 cr hrs) (prerequisite is CSE 3461) CSE 5474: Software Security (3 cr hrs) Recommended courses: CSE 5351: Introduction to Cryptography (3 cr hrs) CSE 5432: Mobile Handset Systems and Networking (3 cr hrs) CSE 5472: Information Security Projects (3 cr hrs). Note that CSE 3241 and 3461 also count as \"core-choice\" courses; CSE 3901 counts as the \"junior project\" course; the other CSE courses count towards the required number of elective hours; and the non-CSE courses can be counted toward the allowed non-CSE hours among the elective hours. Note also that this option as well as others such as Information Systems under the semester system have been approved by the CSE faculty and are in the process of being approved by the university which is expected to be completed within two months or so; once that approval is complete, students' transcripts will indicate, as under the quarter system, the particular tech elective option that she completed. Other recommended/interesting courses (courses at the 6000-level and above are meant mainly for grad students; undergrad students will require special permission to take them): Phil 1338: Introduction to computing ethics (3 cr hrs) AMIS 4660 Electronic Commerce U AMIS 4660: Electronic Commerce U AMIS 7640 Data Mining for Business Intelligence ECE 5101 Introduction to Wireless Networking ECE 5200 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing IWSE 2010 Systems Modeling IWSE 5760 Visual Analytics and Sensemaking Econ 1100.03 Economics of the Internet Law 7804: The Law of Cyberspace Law 7806: Privacy Law 7815: Introduction to Intellectual Property L Resources This program is offered with support from the Ohio State Institute for Cybersecurity and Digital Trust ( ICDT ).

Comp Exam), a student may opt-in the PA/NP grade for up to ONE out of the three graduate core courses that he/she is required to take (6331, 6231 or 6341, and 6421 or 6431) and must have an average GPA of 3.0 or better in the remaining two required graduate core courses. b) Ph.D. students\u2019 minor areas for candidacy exam: a student may opt-in the PA/NP grade for up to ONE course in total for his/her two minor areas and the average GPA for the rest of the courses in each of the two minor areas needs to be 3.3 or better. c) Ph.D. students\u2019 accelerated option of the Qual Exam: All of the three core courses must be letter-graded (i.e., no PA/NP courses) for calculating the GPA requirement (3.6 or better). 3. What is the equivalent letter grade for Pass grade in graduate courses? The Graduate School approved that a grade of C- or better will constitute a Pass grade in SP20 only. 4. What should I do if I want to elect the PA/NP option for a course? Ms. Kitty Reeves will announce a Qualtrics survey so that you can put your name and courses that you would like to opt in the PA/NP grade. The deadline for electing the PA/NP option on the survey is April 16, 2020, so the last set of PA/NP requests can be sent in on the due date of April 17th, 2020. Should you have questions about the PA/NP option or other general questions, please feel free to consult Ms. Kathryn Reeves ( reeves.92@osu.edu ),\u00a0Prof. Feng Qin ( qin.34@osu.edu ) or\u00a0Ms. Lynn Lyons ( lyons.220@osu.edu ). Where can I go with questions and concerns about the transition to online learning? For general information, tools and tips, etc. please visit https://keeplearning.osu.edu . Please watch your e-mail for updates from your individual course instructors regarding attendance, participation, syllabus updates, exams, etc.\u00a0 You are also welcome to e-mail them with questions, but please be very patient as you wait for a response. What happens if I know I will be unable to connect to the zoom class? Contact your instructor.\u00a0 There are going to be a number of students who cannot connect.\u00a0 Note that you can phone in to the class with a phone number - the instructor should provide the phone number. Instructors should be able to provide asynchronous content, usually recordings of the classes you missed.\u00a0 You will be required to view these on-line. What happens if the zoom class is given at 2:00 a.m. in my time zone? Contact your instructor.\u00a0There are going to be a number of students with this problem.\u00a0 Instructors should be able to provide asynchronous content, usually recordings of the classes you missed.\u00a0You will be required to view these on-line. What happens if I try to connect to the zoom session but am unable? Check CarmenCanvas and your class\u2019s preferred discussion site to see if others are having a similar problem. Instructor technology and web connectivity can fail (as can zoom,) and 40, 60 or 160 e-mail messages flooding your instructor\u2019s mailbox are not helpful.\u00a0 If you are the only one with a problem, try phoning in and then contact your instructor.\u00a0 If it seems that the whole zoom session is not working, then wait for instructions from your instructor.\u00a0 If a class zoom session fails and you (and others) have not received any communication from the instructor for a whole day, then contact Kitty Reeves (reeves.92). The class is over but I do not see a recording posted. It sometimes takes time (possibly hours or longer) for zoom to download a recording.\u00a0 Your instructor may also have to upload it to\u00a0mediasite\u00a0or buckeye box and will have to post a link on CarmenCanvas.\u00a0 Please wait 24 hours before contacting your instructor about a missing recording posting. Why am I not able to schedule any courses? First, check to see when your enrollment appointment begins. \u00a0Go to your Student Center on Buckeye Link and click the \u201cdetails\u201d link to select the appropriate term.\u00a0 You can still use Schedule Planner, but will not be able to add any courses before your enrollment appointment begins.

    "text_content": "POCAT Information | Computer Science and Engineering Skip to main content Breadcrumb Home Current Students POCAT Information POCAT Information Background : For convenience, we have classified our program outcomes, which are essentially identical to the ABET EAC Criterion 3 outcomes, into three groups. The first group consists of outcomes dealing with technical skills; the second group consists of outcomes dealing with \"soft skills\"; the third group consists of the two outcomes dealing with societal issues. This page concerns our approach to evaluating the outcomes in the first group. Outcomes in the group : The outcomes in the first group are: a. an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering; b. an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data; c. an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability; e. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems; f. an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility; k. an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. Evaluation of outcomes : Students acquire the knowledge and skills that help them achieve these outcomes throughout the curriculum. We created POCAT(!) (Program OutComes Achievement Test) to help assess the degree to which specific program outcomes were achieved by Computer Science students as they near completion of the program. The questions on POCAT are based on topics from various high-level courses (such as CSE 2331, 2431, 2501, 3241, 3341, 3421, and 390X). However, they are not the typical questions one might find in, say, the final exams of these courses. Instead, they are more conceptual and are intended to see how well students understand key concepts from across the curriculum and, more specifically, the degree to which they have achieved the outcomes listed above. All BSCSE, BSCIS, and BACIS majors will be required to take the POCAT. The performance on the test will not affect the grades of individual students in any courses, nor will any records be retained on how individual students performed on the test. Initially, we had considered the possibility of doing some simple statistical analysis to see, for example, whether factors such as which particular section of a course a student takes, or the order in which a student takes two specific courses, has any effect on the student's performance in questions dealing with particular areas. Hence, in the pilot test in AU05, we had asked students taking the test to write their names on the test papers; however, the students who took the pilot test overwhelmingly preferred that we not ask for student names. Therefore, students are no longer asked to put their names on the test. Each test paper has a preprinted letter code on it; a student taking the test can, if he/she chooses to, make a note of the code that appears on his/her particular test paper; no one else knows the codes corresponding to individual students. Thus when summary results are posted by code, each individual student will be able to determine how well he/she performed on the test, but no one else will have this information. To reiterate, the goal is to assess the program, in particular to assess the effectiveness of the program in ensuring that students achieve the outcomes listed above by the time of their graduation. The assessment is offered near the end of the term, with multiple times available to fit a student\u2019s schedule. Here are a sample test and solution guide for the sample: Sample POCAT Solution guide to sample POCAT Support CSE $50,000 for the 50th Donate to the department to help us reach the goal of $50,000 in donations to celebrate over 50 years of teaching excellence Click here to make your donation.

For general information, tools and tips, etc. please visit https://keeplearning.osu.edu Please watch your e-mail for updates from your individual course instructors regarding attendance, participation, syllabus updates, exams, etc.\u00a0 You are also welcome to e-mail them with questions, but please be very patient as you wait for a response. Pass/Non-Pass Policy Where can I go with questions about the Pass/Non-Pass policy approved for Spring 2020? Most of your questions are likely answered here . Please review this website thoroughly before contacting the Advising Office with questions. CSE Course Scheduling Why am I getting a prerequisite error? Prerequisites for all CSE courses are being enforced, and several courses have had prerequisites updated.\u00a0 In particular, many courses numbered CSE 2331 and higher now require being in the CSE or CIS major, or a related major such as Data Analytics.\u00a0 Students who have not been admitted to the designated major will not be able to schedule or waitlist the affected courses.\u00a0 PLAN ACCORDINGLY. Why am I not able to schedule any courses? First, check to see when your enrollment appointment begins. \u00a0Go to your Student Center on Buckeye Link and click the \u201cdetails\u201d link to select the appropriate term.\u00a0 You can still use Schedule Planner, but will not be able to add any courses before your enrollment appointment begins. Everyone must complete the Financial Responsibility Statement on Buckeye Link.\u00a0 If you have other holds or items on your To Do List, check the details on your Buckeye Link and follow the instructions. What is happening with CSE 3232 and 5000-level courses? If you are planning to take CSE 3232 and/or a 5000-level course (including the capstones), you must waitlist it.\u00a0 For CSE 3232, graduating seniors with the Software Engineering specialization will be placed in first (in waitlist order), followed by other graduating seniors, then others, until capacity is reached.\u00a0 For CSE 552X, graduating seniors with the Artificial Intelligence specialization will be placed in first (in waitlist order), followed by other graduating seniors, then others, until capacity is reached.\u00a0 For all other 5000-level courses, including capstones, graduating seniors will be placed in first (in waitlist order) regardless of specialization \u00a0We are managing the enrollments in these courses due to the number of CSE and CIS graduating seniors who need these courses to complete degree requirements. Why am I having trouble finding a particular CSE class on Buckeye Link/Schedule Planner? First, always filter your course career to \u201cundergraduate\u201d .\u00a0To find waitlist-only courses in SIS (Buckeyelink) or Schedule Planner, you must uncheck the \u201cshow open classes only\u201d button when doing a Class Search in SIS, or if you are in Schedule Planner, you must change the Course Status to include waitlist courses.\u00a0 In addition, when actually adding the courses, you must make sure to check the \u201cadd to waitlist if class is full\u201d box when it comes up.\u00a0 If you are searching with all options available and a course is still not showing up, then the course is not being offered. Admission to Major I am a pre-major hoping to get into CSE or CIS after this semester. What do I need to be aware of regarding the pass/non-pass policy? The requirements for admission to the CSE and CIS majors HAVE NOT CHANGED.\u00a0 Students must still complete all course requirements and meet minimum Cumulative and Major GPA requirements. If you are completing CSE 2221 this semester (SP20) and choose the PA/NP option for it, you will not be establishing your Major GPA and thus will not be eligible for admission to the major.\u00a0 If you Pass the course, you will still be able to take CSE 2231 and 2321 as a pre-major, and you will have to reapply during the term in which you complete these two courses. If you are completing CSE 2231 and 2321, or higher, this semester (SP20) and choose the option for any of your current CSE courses, your Major GPA will be based on CSE 2221 and any other higher CSE courses for which you have received a letter grade. BEFORE YOU DECIDE whether to take the option, consult with your academic advisor to review your current record and current standing in your CSE courses to determine the impact taking the option may have on admission to the major. The department will not count this semester against the maximum number of times students may apply to the major, so take the time to consult with your advisor and consider carefully what course of action may be in your best interest We have received some questions regarding using PA/NP for the required non-CSE courses.\u00a0 These courses have always been accepted as long as course credit is earned, which occurs with a grade of D or higher.\u00a0 If you choose the PA/NP option for any of these courses, you must successfully Pass to gain course credit. How can I contact the CSE Advising Office? Visit the CSE Advising Office website and click on the link that best applies to you.

K. Dey , T. Hou, and S. Mandal .\u00a0\u00a0Computational Topology in Image Context (CTIC 2019), to appear. arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04807 See this web-page for software etc.: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/PersLoop/ Persistence diagrams, which summarize the birth and death of homological features extracted from data, are employed as stable signatures for applications in image analysis and other areas. Besides simply considering the multiset of intervals included in a persistence diagram, some applications need to find representative cycles for the intervals. In this paper, we address the problem of computing these representative cycles, termed as\u00a0persistent $1$-cycles. The definition of persistent cycles is based on the interval module decomposition of persistence modules, which reveals the structure of persistent homology. After showing that the computation of the optimal persistent $1$-cycles is NP-hard, \u00a0we propose an alternative set of\u00a0\u00a0meaningful\u00a0persistent $1$-cycles that can be computed with an efficient polynomial time algorithm. We also inspect the stability issues of the optimal persistent $1$-cycles and the persistent $1$-cycles computed by our algorithm with the observation that the perturbations of both cannot be properly bounded. We design a software which applies our algorithm to various datasets. Experiments on 3D point clouds, mineral structures, and images show the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice. Filtration simplification for persistent homology via edge contraction T. K. Dey , R. Slechta.\u00a0\u00a0Submitted, \u00a0October 2018. arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04388 Persistent homology is a popular data analysis technique that is used to capture the changing topology of a filtration associated with some simplicial complex $K$. These topological changes are summarized in persistence diagrams. We propose two contraction operators which when applied to $K$ and its associated filtration, bound the perturbation in the persistence diagrams. The first assumes that the underlying space of $K$ is a $2$-manifold and ensures that simplices are paired with the same simplices in the contracted complex as they are in the original. The second is for arbitrary $d$-complexes, and bounds the bottleneck distance between the initial and contracted $p$-dimensional persistence diagrams. This is accomplished by defining interleaving maps between persistence modules which arise from chain maps defined over the filtrations. In addition, we show how the second operator can efficiently compose across multiple contractions. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the second operator's utility on manifolds. Computing height persistence and homology generators in R^3 efficiently T. K. Dey ,\u00a0Proc. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms, 2019 (SODA 19), to appear.. arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03655 Recently it has been shown that computing the dimension of the\u00a0\u00a0 first homology group $H_1(K)$ of a simplicial $2$-complex $K$\u00a0 embedded linearly in $R^4$ is as hard as computing the rank of a sparse $0-1$\u00a0\u00a0 matrix. This puts a major roadblock to computing persistence and\u00a0a homology basis (generators) for complexes embedded in $R^4$\u00a0 and beyond in less than quadratic or even near-quadratic time.\u00a0But, what about dimension three? It is known that persistence for piecewise linear functions on a complex $K$ with $n$ simplices can be computed in $O(n\\log n)$ time\u00a0and a set of generators of total size $k$ can be computed in $O(n+k)$ time when $K$ is a graph or a surface\u00a0linearly embedded in $R^3$. But,\u00a0the question for general simplicial complexes $K$\u00a0 linearly embedded in $R^3$ is not completely settled. No algorithm with a complexity better than that of \u00a0the matrix multiplication\u00a0is known for this important case. We show that the persistence for {\\em height functions} on such complexes,\u00a0hence called {\\em height persistence},\u00a0can be computed in $O(n\\log n)$ time.\u00a0This allows us to compute a basis (generators) of $H_i(K)$, $i=1,2$, in $O(n\\log n+k)$ time where $k$ is the size of the output. This improves significantly the current best bound of $O(n^{\\omega})$, $\\omega$ being the matrix multiplication exponent.\u00a0We achieve these improved bounds by leveraging\u00a0recent results on zigzag persistence in computational topology, new observations about Reeb graphs, and some efficient geometric data structures. Edge contraction in persistence-generated discrete Morse vector fields T. K. Dey and R. Slechta.\u00a0Proc. SMI 2018,\u00a0 Computers & Graphics,\u00a0.Vol. 74, 33-43. Journal version: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2018.05.002 Recently, discrete Morse vector fields have been shown to be useful in various applications. Analogous to the simplification of large meshes using edge contractions, one may want to simplify the cell complex $K$ on which a discrete Morse vector field $V(K)$ is defined. To this end, we define a gradient aware edge contraction operator for triangulated $2$-manifolds with the following guarantee. If $V(K)$ was generated by a specific persistence-based method, then the vector field that results from our contraction operator is exactly the same as the vector field produced by applying the same persistence-based method to the contracted complex. An implication of this result is that local operations on $V(K)$ are sufficient to produce the persistence-based vector field on the contracted complex. Furthermore, our experiments show that the structure of the vector field is largely preserved by our operator. For example, $1$-unstable manifolds remain largely unaffected by the contraction. This suggests that for some applications of discrete Morse theory, it is sufficient to use a contracted complex.

Lipinski, M. Mrozek. https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06590 . 2018. Submitted to SIAM J. on Applied Dynamical System. We investigate combinatorial dynamical systems on simplicial complexes considered as\u00a0finite topological spaces.\u00a0 Such systems arise in a natural way from sampling dynamics and may be used to reconstruct some features\u00a0 of the dynamics directly from the sample.\u00a0 We study the homological persistence of\u00a0Morse decompositions\u00a0of such systems,\u00a0 an important descriptor of the dynamics, as a tool for validating the reconstruction. Our framework can be viewed as a step toward extending the classical persistence theory to ``vector cloud\" data.\u00a0 We present experimental results on two numerical examples. Computing Bottleneck Distance for 2-D Interval Decomposable Modules T. K. Dey, C. Xin. Proc. 34th Internat. Sympos. Comput. Geoem., 32:1--32:15\u00a0(SoCG 2018). Computation of the interleaving distance between persistence modules is a central task in topological data analysis. For $1$-D persistence modules, thanks to the isometry theorem, this can be done by computing the bottleneck distance with known efficient algorithms. The question is open for most $n$-D persistence modules, $n>1$, because of the well recognized complications of the indecomposables. Here, we consider a reasonably complicated class called {\\em $2$-D interval decomposable} modules whose indecomposables may have a description of non-constant complexity. We present a polynomial time algorithm to compute the bottleneck distance for these modules from indecomposables, which bounds the interleaving distance from above, and give another algorithm to compute a new distance called {\\em dimension distance} that bounds it from below. Graph Reconstruction by Discrete Morse Theory T. K. Dey, J. Wang and Y. Wang.\u00a0 Proc. Internat. Sympos. Comput. Geom., 31:1--31:15\u00a0(SoCG 2018). Recovering hidden graph-like structures from potentially noisy data is a fundamental task in modern data analysis. Recently, a persistence-guided discrete Morse-based framework to extract a geometric graph from low-dimensional data has become popular. However, to date, there is very limited theoretical understanding of this framework in terms of graph reconstruction. This paper makes a first step towards closing this gap. Specifically, first, leveraging existing theoretical understanding of persistence-guided discrete Morse cancellation, we provide a simplified version of the existing discrete Morse-based graph reconstruction algorithm. We then introduce a simple and natural noise model and show that the aforementioned framework can correctly reconstruct a graph under this noise model, in the sense that it has the same loop structure as the hidden ground-truth graph, and is also geometrically close. We also provide some experimental results for our simplified graph-reconstruction algorithm. Also see this paper in SIGSPATIAL (2017).

Application of \u00a0Topological Data Analysis in Machine Learning for\u00a0 Image and Protein Classification Protein Classification with Improved Topological Data Analysis T. K. Dey and S. Mandal. Proc. Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2018), 6:1--6:13. DOI 10.4230/LIPIcs.WABI.2018.6 Web-page: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/proteinTDA/ Automated annotation and analysis of protein molecules have long been a topic of interest due to immediate applications in medicine and drug design. In this work, we propose a topology based, fast, scalable, and parameter-free technique to generate protein signatures. We build an initial simplicial complex using information about the protein\u2019s constituent atoms, including radius and existing chemical bonds, to model the hierarchical structure of the molecule. Simplicial collapse is used to construct a filtration which we use to compute persistent homology. This information constitutes our signature for the protein. In addition, we demonstrate that this technique scales well to large proteins. Our method shows sizable time and memory improvements compared to other topology based approaches. We use the signature to train a protein domain classifier. Finally, we compare this classifier against models built from state-of-the-art structure- based protein signatures on standard datasets to achieve a substantial improvement in accuracy. Improved Image Classification using Topological Persistence T. K. Dey, S. Mandal, W. Varcho.\u00a0 Proc. Vision Modeling and Visualization.,\u00a0\u00a0(VMV 2017). http://dx.doi.org/10.2312/vmv.20171272 Web-page: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/imagePers/ Image classification has been a topic of interest for many years. With the advent of Deep Learning, impressive progress has been made on the task, resulting in quite accurate classification. Our work focuses on improving modern image classification techniques by considering topological features as well. We show that incorporating this information allows our models to improve the accuracy, precision and recall on test data, thus providing evidence that topological signatures can be leveraged for enhancing some of the state-of-the art applications in computer vision. Efficient Algorithms for Computing a Minimal Homology Basis T. K. Dey, T. Li, and Y. Wang. Proc. LATIN 2018: Theoretical Informatics, LNCS, Vol. 10807, 376--398\u00a0(LATIN 2018). Efficient computation of shortest cycles which form a homology basis under\u00a0Z2-additions in a given simplicial complex\u00a0K has been researched actively in recent years. When the complex K is a weighted graph with\u00a0n vertices and\u00a0m edges, the problem of computing a shortest (homology) cycle basis is known to be solvable in $O(m^2n/\\log n+ n^2m)$-time. Several works [1,2] have addressed the case when the complex K is a\u00a02-manifold. The complexity of these algorithms depends on the rank\u00a0g of the one-dimensional homology group of K. This rank g has a lower bound of $\\Theta(n)$, where n denotes the number of simplices in K giving an $O(n^4)$ worst-case time complexity for the algorithms in [1,2]. This worst-case complexity is improved in [3] to $O(n^\\omega+n^2g^{\\omega-1})$ for general simplicial complexes where $\\omega< 2.3728639$ [4] is the matrix multiplication exponent. Taking $g=\\Theta(n)$, this provides an $O(n^{\\omega+1})$ worst-case algorithm. In this paper, we improve this time complexity. Combining\u00a0the divide and conquer technique from [5] with the use of annotations from [3], we present an algorithm that runs in $O(n^\\omega+n^2g)$ time giving the first $O(n^3)$ worst-case algorithm for general complexes. If instead of minimal basis, we settle for approximate basis, we can improve the running time even further. We show that a\u00a02-approximate minimal homology basis can be computed in $O(n^{\\omega}\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ expected time. We also study more general measures for defining the minimal basis and identify reasonable conditions on these measures that allow computing a minimal basis efficiently. Temporal Hierarchical Clustering T. K. Dey, A. Rossi, and A. Sidiropoulos. Proc.\u00a0 28th Internat. Symposium on Algorithms and Computation\u00a0(ISAAC 2017). https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09904 We study hierarchical clusterings of metric spaces that change over time. This is a natural geometric primitive for the analysis of dynamic data sets. Specifically, we introduce and study the problem of finding a temporally coherent sequence of hierarchical clusterings from a sequence of unlabeled point sets. We encode the clustering objective by embedding each point set into an ultrametric space, which naturally induces a hierarchical clustering of the set of points. We enforce temporal coherence among the embeddings by finding correspondences between successive pairs of ultrametric spaces which exhibit small distortion in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We present both upper and lower bounds on the approximability of the resulting optimization problems. Temporal Clustering T. K. Dey, A. Rossi, and A. Sidiropoulos. Proc. European Symposium on Algorithms\u00a0(ESA 2017). Full Version https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05964 We study the problem of clustering sequences of unlabeled point sets taken from a common metric space. Such scenarios arise naturally in applications where a system or process is observed in distinct time intervals, such as biological surveys and contagious disease surveillance. In this more general setting existing algorithms for classical (i.e.~static) clustering problems are not applicable anymore. We propose a set of optimization problems which we collectively refer to as \\emph{temporal clustering}. The quality of a solution to a temporal clustering instance can be quantified using three parameters: the number of clusters $k$, the spatial clustering cost $r$, and the maximum cluster displacement $\\delta$ between consecutive time steps. We consider spatial clustering costs which generalize the well-studied $k$-center, discrete $k$-median, and discrete $k$-means objectives of classical clustering problems. We develop new algorithms that achieve trade-offs between the three objectives $k$, $r$, and $\\delta$. Our upper bounds are complemented by inapproximability results. Topological analysis of nerves, Reeb spaces, mappers, and multiscale mappers T. K. Dey, F. Memoli, and Y. Wang. Proc. Internat. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (2017)\u00a0(SoCG 2017). Full Version [ talk slides ] Data analysis often concerns not only the space where data come from, but also various types of maps attached to data. In recent years, several related structures have been used to study maps on data, including Reeb spaces, mappers and multiscale mappers. The construction of these structures also relies on the so-called \\emph{nerve} of a cover of the domain. In this paper, we aim to analyze the topological information encoded in these structures in order to provide better understanding of these structures and facilitate their practical usage. More specifically, we show that the one-dimensional homology of the nerve complex $N(\\mathcal{U})$ of a path-connected cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of a domain $X$ cannot be richer than that of the domain $X$ itself. Intuitively, this result means that no new $H_1$-homology class can be ``created'' under a natural map from $X$ to the nerve complex $N(\\mathcal{U})$. Equipping $X$ with a pseudometric $d$, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of $H_1(X)$ that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of \\emph{size} of the covering elements in $\\mathcal{U}$. These fundamental results about nerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the $H_1$-homology of Reeb spaces, mappers and multiscale mappers. The analysis of $H_1$-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher dimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a Gromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and interleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology groups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces. Declutter and resample: Towards parameter free denoising M. Buchet, T. K. Dey, J. Wang, and Y. Wang.\u00a0 Proc. Internat. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (2017),\u00a0(SoCG 2017). Full Version [talk slides] In many data analysis applications the following scenario is commonplace:\u00a0we are given a point set that is supposed to sample a hidden ground truth $K$ in a metric space, but it got corrupted with noise so that some of the\u00a0 data points lie far away from $K$ creating outliers also termed as {\\em ambient noise}. One of the main goals of denoising algorithms is to eliminate such noise so that the curated data lie within a bounded Hausdorff distance of $K$. Popular denoising approaches such as deconvolution and thresholding often require the user to set several parameters and/or to choose an appropriate noise model while guaranteeing only asymptotic convergence. Our goal is to lighten this burden as much as possible while ensuring theoretical guarantees in all cases. Specifically, first, we propose a simple denoising algorithm that requires only a single parameter but provides a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the output on general input points. We argue that this single parameter cannot be avoided. We next present a simple algorithm that avoids even this parameter by paying for it with a slight strengthening of the sampling condition on the input points which is not unrealistic. We also provide some preliminary empirical evidence that our algorithms are effective in practice. Parameter-free topology inference and sparsification for data on manifolds T. K. Dey, Z. Dong, and Y. Wang. (2015), older version at arXiv:1505.06462. Proc. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms\u00a0(SODA 2017). [ talk slides ] In topology inference from data, current approaches face two major problems. One concerns the selection of a correct parameter to build an appropriate complex on top of the data points; the other involves with the typical `large' size of this complex. We address these two issues in the context of inferring homology from sample points of a smooth manifold of known dimension sitting in an Euclidean space\u00a0Rk. We show that, for a sample size of n\u00a0npoints, we can identify a set of\u00a0O(n2)O(n^2) points (as opposed to\u00a0O(n\u2308k2\u2309)O(n^\\ceil{k/2}) Voronoi vertices) approximating a subset of the medial axis that suffices to compute a distance sandwiched between the well known local feature size and the local weak feature size (in fact, the approximating set can be further reduced in size to O(n)\u00a0O(n)). This distance, called the lean feature size, helps pruning the input set at least to the level of local feature size while making the data locally uniform. The local uniformity in turn helps in building a complex for homology inference on top of the sparsified data without requiring any user-supplied distance threshold. Unlike most topology inference results, ours does not require that the input is dense relative to a {\\em global} feature such as {\\em reach} or {\\em weak feature size}; instead it can be adaptive with respect to the local feature size. We present some empirical evidence in support of our theoretical claims. SimBa: An efficient tool for approximating Rips-filtration persistence via Simplicial Batch-collapse T. K. Dey, D. Shi, and Y. Wang. European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2016). An Extended Version . [ talk slides ] SimBa Software SimPers Software In topological data analysis, a point cloud data P extracted from a metric space is often analyzed by computing the persistence diagram or barcodes of a sequence of Rips complexes built on P indexed by a scale parameter. Unfortunately, even for input of moderate size, the size of the Rips complex may become prohibitively large as the scale parameter increases. Starting with the \\emph{Sparse Rips filtration} introduced by Sheehy, some existing methods aim to reduce the size of the complex so as to improve the time efficiency as well. However, as we demonstrate, existing approaches still fall short of scaling well, especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we investigate the advantages and limitations of existing approaches. Based on insights gained from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called\u00a0SimBa, for approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a new sparse Rips-like filtration. We experiment on a variety of low and high dimensional data sets. We show that our strategy presents a significant size reduction, and our algorithm for approximating Rips filtration persistence is order of magnitude faster than existing methods in practice. Multiscale Mapper: Topological summarization via codomain covers T. K. Dey, F. Memoli, and Y. Wang. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2016)\u00a0 Older version arXiv:\u00a01504.03763v1 [talk slides ] SODA version Summarizing topological information from datasets and maps defined on them is a central theme in topological data analysis.\u00a0Mapper, a tool for such summarization, takes as input both a possibly high dimensional dataset and a map defined on the data, and produces a summary of the data by using a cover of the codomain of the map. This cover, via a pullback operation to the domain, produces a simplicial complex connecting the data points. The resulting view of the data through a cover of the codomain offers flexibility in analyzing the data. However, it offers only a view at a fixed scale at which the cover is constructed. Inspired by the concept, we explore a notion of hierarchical family of coverings which induces a hierarchical family of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, which we call\u00a0multiscale mapper. We study the resulting structure, its associated persistence module, and its stability under perturbations of the maps and the coverings. The information encoded in multiscale mapper complements that of individual mappers at fixed scales. An upshot of this development is a practical algorithm for computing the persistence diagram of multiscale mapper when the domain is a simplicial complex and the map is a real-valued piecewise-linear function. Segmenting a surface mesh into pants using Morse theory M. Hajij, T. K. Dey, and X. Li. Graphical Models, Vol 88 (2016), 12--21. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070316300376 A pair of pants is a genus zero orientable surface with three boundary components. A pants decomposition of a surface is a finite collection of unordered pairwise disjoint simple closed curves embedded in the surface that decompose the surface into pants. In this paper, we present two Morse theory based algorithms for pants decomposition of a surface mesh. Both algorithms operate on achoice of an appropriate Morse function on the surface. The first algorithm uses this Morse function to identify handles that are glued systematically to obtain a pants decomposition. The second algorithm uses the Reeb graph of the Morse function to obtain a pants decomposition. Both algorithms work for surfaces with or without boundaries. Our perliminary implementation of the two algorithms shows that both algorithms run in much less time than an existing state-of-the-art method, and the Reeb graph based algorithm achieves the best time efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our algorothms agaisnt noise. Comparing graphs via persistence distortion T. K. Dey, D. Shi and Y. Wang. 31st Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (SoCG 15). [ GraphComp software ] Metric graphs are ubiquitous in science and engineering. For example, many data are drawn from hidden spaces that are graph-like, such as the cosmic web. A metric graph offers one of the simplest yet still meaningful ways to represent the non-linear structure hidden behind the data. In this paper, we propose a new distance between two finite metric graphs, called the persistence distortion-distance, which draws upon a topological idea. This topological perspective along with the metric space viewpoint provide a new angle to the graph matching problem. Our persistence-distortion distance has two properties not shared by previous methods: First, it is stable against the perturbations of the input graph metrics. Second, it is a \\emph{continuous} distance measure, in the sense that it is defined on an alignment of the underlying spaces of input graphs, instead of merely their nodes. This makes our persistence-distortion distance robust against, for example, different discretizations of the same underlying graph. Despite considering the input graphs as continuous spaces, that is, taking all points into account, we show that we can compute the persistence-distortion distance in polynomial time. The time complexity for the discrete case where only graph nodes are considered is much faster. We also provide some preliminary experimental results to demonstrate the use of the new distance measure. Topological analysis of scalar fields with outliers M. Buchet,\u00a0 F. Chazal, T. K. Dey, F. Fan, S. Oudot and Y. Wang. 31st Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (SoCG 15). arXiv:1412.1680. Given a real-valued function\u00a0ff\u00a0 defined over a manifold\u00a0MM\u00a0 embedded in R^dRd, we are interested in recovering structural information about f\u00a0ffrom the sole information of its values on a finite sample PP. Existing methods provide approximation to the persistence diagram of\u00a0ff\u00a0 when the noise is bounded in both the functional and geometric domains. However, they fail in the presence of aberrant values, also called outliers, both in theory and practice. We propose a new algorithm that deals with outliers. We handle aberrant functional values with a method inspired from the k-nearest neighbors regression and the local median filtering, while the geometric outliers are handled using the distance to a measure. Combined with topological results on nested filtrations, our algorithm performs robust topological analysis of scalar fields in a wider range of noise models than handled by current methods. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of our approximation and some experimental results illustrating its behavior. Spectral concentration and greedy k-clustering T. K. Dey,\u00a0 A. Rossi., and A. Sidiropoulos,\u00a0\u00a0arXiv:1404.1008v2. Comput. Geom. Theory & Applications (2018), to appear. A popular graph clustering method is to consider the embedding of an input graph into R^k induced by the first k eigenvectors of its Laplacian, and to partition the graph via geometric manipulations on the resulting metric space. Despite the practical success of this methodology, there is limited understanding of several heuristics that follow this framework. We provide theoretical justification for one such natural and computationally efficient variant. Our result can be summarized as follows. A partition of a graph is called strong if each cluster has small external conductance, and large internal conductance. We present a simple greedy spectral clustering algorithm which returns a partition that is provably close to a suitably strong partition, provided that such a partition exists. A recent result shows that strong partitions exist for graphs with a sufficiently large spectral gap between the k-th and (k+1)-th eigenvalues. Taking this together with our main theorem gives a spectral algorithm which finds a partition close to a strong one for graphs with large enough spectral gap. We also show how this simple greedy algorithm can be implemented in near-linear time for any fixed k and error guarantee. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on some real-world and synthetic inputs. Dimenison detection with local homology T. K. Dey,\u00a0 F. Fan, and Y. Wang, Canadian Conf. Comput. Geom. (CCCG 2014), Full version arXiv: 1405.3534 [ Talk Slide ] Detecting the dimension of a hidden manifold from a point sample has become an important problem in the current data-driven era. Indeed, estimating the shape dimension is often the first step in studying the processes or phenomena\u00a0 associated to the data. Among the many dimension detection algorithms proposed in various fields, a few can provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness of the estimated dimension. However, the correctness usually requires certain regularity of the input: the input points are either uniformly randomly sampled in a statistical setting, or they form the so-called $(\\eps,\\delta)$-sample which can be neither too dense nor too sparse. Here, we propose a purely topological technique to detect dimensions. Our algorithm is provably correct and works under a more relaxed sampling condition: we do not require uniformity, and we also allow Hausdorff noise. Our approach detects dimension by determining local homology. The computation of this topological structure is much less sensitive to the local distribution of points, which leads to the relaxation of the sampling conditions. Furthermore, by leveraging various developments in computational topology, we show that this local homology at a point $z$ can be computed \\emph{exactly} for manifolds using Vietoris-Rips complexes whose vertices are confined within a local neighborhood of $z$. We implement our algorithm and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method using both synthetic and real data sets. Computing topological persistence for simplicial maps T. K. Dey,\u00a0 F. Fan, and Y. Wang., (SoCG 2014), Proc. 30th Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (2013). (our algorithm works for any finite field--see the conclusion of updated Full version ) [ SimpPers software ] [ Talk slide ] Algorithms for persistent homology and zigzag persistent homology are well-studied for homology modules where homomorphisms are induced by inclusion maps. In this paper, we propose a practical algorithm for computing persistence under\u00a0Z_2 coefficients for a sequence of general simplicial maps. First, we observe that it is not hard to simulate simplicial maps by inclusion maps but not necessarily in a monotone direction. This, combined with the known algorithms for zigzag persistence, provides an algorithm for computing the persistence induced by simplicial maps. Our main result is that the above simple minded approach can be improved for a sequence of simplicial maps given in a monotone direction. The improvement results from the use of the so-called annotations that we show can determine the persistence of simplicial maps using a lighter data structure. A consistent annotation through atomic operations implies the maintenance of a consistent cohomology basis, hence a homology basis by duality. While the idea of maintaining a cohomology basis through an inclusion is not new, maintaining them through a vertex collapse is new, which constitutes an important atomic operation for simulating simplicial maps. Annotations support the vertex collapse in addition to the usual inclusion quite naturally. Finally, we exhibit an application of this new tool in which we approximate the persistence diagram of a filtration of Rips complexes where vertex collapses are used to tame the blow-up in size. Automatic posing of meshed human model using point clouds T. K. Dey,\u00a0 B. Fu, H. Wang, and L. Wang., (SMI 2014), Computers & Graphics, Vol. 46, pages 14--24. [ Talk slide ] [ Video link] We introduce a markerless approach to deform a quality human body template mesh from its original pose to a different pose specified by a point cloud. The point cloud may be noisy, incomplete, or even captured from a different person. In this approach, we first build coarse correspondences between the template mesh and the point cloud through a squeezed spectral embedding technique that exploits human body extremities. Based on these correspondences, we define the goal of non-rigid registration using an elastic energy functional and apply a discrete gradient flow to reduce the difference between a coarse control mesh and the point cloud. The deformed template mesh can then be obtained from the deformation of the control mesh using mean value coordinates afterwards. Our experiments show (see the supplementary video) that the approach is capable of equipping a mesh with the pose of a scanned point cloud data even if it is incomplete and noisy. Edge contractions and simplicial homology T. K. Dey,\u00a0 A. N. Hir\u00a0ani, B. Krishnamoorthy, and G. Smith. April, 2013. arXiv:1304.0664 We study the effect of edge contractions on simplicial\u00a0 homology because these contractions have turned to be useful in various\u00a0 applications involving topology. It was observed previously that \u00a0 contracting edges that\u00a0 satisfy the so called\u00a0\u00a0link condition\u00a0preserves homeomorphism\u00a0 in low dimensional complexes, and homotopy in general. \u00a0 But, checking the link condition involves computation in all dimensions,\u00a0 and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\u00a0 complexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link condition for each\u00a0dimension p, and study its\u00a0 effect on edge contractions. We prove the following: (i) For homology\u00a0 groups, edges satisfying the\u00a0 p- and (p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without\u00a0 disturbing the p-dimensional homology group. (ii) For\u00a0 relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the (p-2)-link conditions\u00a0 suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not introduce any new class in\u00a0 any of the resulting relative\u00a0 homology groups, though some of the existing classes can be\u00a0 destroyed. Unfortunately, the surjection in relative homolgy groups\u00a0 does not guarantee that no new relative\u00a0 torsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition alone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the p-link condition cannot be avoided.\u00a0 The\u00a0 results on relative homology and relative torsion are motivated by\u00a0 recent results on computing optimal homologous chains, which state\u00a0 that such problems can be solved by linear programming if the\u00a0 complex has no relative torsion.\u00a0 Edge contractions that do not\u00a0 introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts. Graph induced complex on point data (full version) T. K. Dey,\u00a0 F. Fan, and Y. Wang., (SoCG 2013) Proc. 29th Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (2013), pages 107--116. [ Talk slides ] [ Web-page ] [ GICsoftware ] The efficiency of extracting topological information from point data depends largely on the complex that is built on top of the data points. From a computational viewpoint, the most favored complexes for this purpose have so far been Vietoris-Rips and witness complexes. While the Vietoris-Rips complex is simple to compute and is a good vehicle for extracting topology of sampled spaces, its size is huge--particularly in high dimensions. The witness complex on the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of a subsampling, but fails to capture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with extra structures. We investigate a complex called the\u00a0graph induced complex\u00a0that, to some extent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still retains the power of capturing the topology as the Vietoris-Rips complex. It only needs a graph connecting the original sample points from which it builds a complex on the subsample thus taming the size considerably. We show that, using the graph induced complex one can (i) infer the one dimensional homology of a manifold from a very lean subsample, (ii) reconstruct a surface in three dimension from a sparse subsample without computing Delaunay triangulations, (iii) infer the persistent homology groups of compact sets from a sufficiently dense sample. We provide experimental evidences in support of our theory. The compressed annotation matrix: an efficient data structure for computing persistent cohomology. J.-D. Boissonnat, T. K. Dey,\u00a0 C. Maria, (ESA 2013), LNCS 8125, 2013. Persistent homology with coefficients in a field F coincides with the same for cohomology because of duality. We propose an implementation of a recently introduced algorithm for persistent cohomology that attaches annotation vectors with the simplices. We separate the representation of the simplicial complex from the representation of the cohomology groups, and introduce a new data structure for maintaining the annotation matrix, which is more compact and reduces substancially the amount of matrix operations. In addition, we propose a heuristic to simplify further the representation of the cohomology groups and improve both time and space complexities. The paper provides a theoretical analysis,\u00a0 as well as a detailed experimental study of our implementation and comparison with state-of-the-art software for persistent homology and cohomology. Note: Also see our `` computing topological persistence for simplicial maps \" paper which motivated this implementation. An efficient computation of handle and tunnel loops via Reeb graphs. T. K. Dey,\u00a0 F. Fan, and Y. Wang. ACM Trans. Graphics (Siggraph 2013), Vol. 32 (4). Supplementary file for proofs . [ Web-page ] [ Software ReebHanTun ] [ Talk slides ] A special family of non-trivial loops on a surface called handle and tunnel loops associates closely to geometric features of ``handles\" and ``tunnels\" respectively in a 3D model. The identification of these handle and tunnel loops can benefit a broad range of applications from topology simplification / repair, and surface parameterization, to feature and shape recognition. Many of the existing efficient algorithms for computing non-trivial loops cannot be used to compute these special type of loops. The two algorithms known for computing handle and tunnel loops provably have a serious drawback that they both require a tessellation of the interior and exterior spaces bounded by the surface. Computing such a tessellation of three dimensional space around the surface is a non-trivial task and can be quite expensive. Furthermore, such a tessellation may need to refine the surface mesh, thus causing the undesirable side-effect of outputting the loops on an altered surface mesh. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute a basis for handle and tunnel loops without requiring any 3D tessellation. This saves time considerably for large meshes making the algorithm scalable while computing the loops on the original input mesh and not on some refined version of it. We use the concept of the Reeb graph which together with several key theoretical insights on linking number provide an initial set of loops that provably constitute a handle and a tunnel basis. We further develop a novel strategy to tighten these handle and tunnel basis loops to make them geometrically relevant. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm as well as show its robustness against noise, and other anomalies in the input. Localized Delaunay Refinement for Piecewise-Smooth Complexes (full version) T. K. Dey and A. Slatton\u00a0 (SoCG 2013) Proc. 29th Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (2013), pages 47--56. [ software LocPSC ] [ Talk Slides ] The Delaunay refinement, a versatile method of mesh generation, is plagued by memory thrashing when required to generate large output meshes. To address this space issue, a localized version of Delaunay refinement was proposed for generating meshes for smooth surfaces and volumes bounded by them. The method embodies a divide-and-conquer paradigm in that it maintains the growing set of sample points with an octree and produces a local mesh within each individual node, and stitches these local meshes seamlessly. The proofs of termination and global consistency for localized methods exploit recently developed sampling theory for smooth surfaces. Unfortunately, these proofs break down for a larger class called piecewise smooth complexes (PSCs) that allow smooth surface patches that are joined along ridges and corners. In this work, we adapt a recently developed sampling and meshing algorithm for PSCs into the localization framework. This requires revisiting the original algorithm, and more importantly re-establishing the correctness proofs to accommodate the localization framework. Our implementation of the algorithm exhibits that it can indeed generate large meshes with significantly less time and memory than the original algorithm without localization. In fact, it beats a state-of-the-art meshing tool of CGAL for generating large meshes. Voronoi-based Feature Curves Extraction for Sampled Singular Surfaces T. K. Dey and L. Wang\u00a0 (SMI 2013), Computers & Graphics, special issue of Shape Modeling International (2013), Vol. 37 (6), 659--668. [ Web-page ] [ software SingularCocone ] The detection and reconstruction of feature curves in surfaces from a point cloud data is a challenging problem because most of the known theories for smooth surfaces break down at these places. The features such as boundaries, sharp ridges and corners, and curves where multiple surface patches intersect creating non-manifold points are often considered important geometries for further processing. As a result, they need to be preserved in a reconstruction of the sampled surface from its point sample. The problem becomes harder in presence of noise. We propose a robust Voronoi-based pipeline that engages several sub steps consisting of approaches proposed originally for smooth case. We modify or enhance them to handle features in singular surfaces. The experimental results provide the evidence that the method is effective. Note: This paper extracts features differently than our `` Feature-Preserving reconstruction of singular surfaces \" paper which introduced the\u00a0WeightCocone\u00a0to reconstruct with feature curves Weighted graph Laplace operator under topological noise T. K. Dey, P. Ranjan, and Y. Wang. (SODA 2013), ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (2013). Recently, various applications have motivated the study of spectral structures (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) of the so-called Laplace-Beltrami operator of a manifold and their discrete versions. A popular choice for the discrete version is the so-called Gaussian weighted graph Laplacian which can be applied to point cloud data that samples a manifold. Naturally, the question of stability of the spectrum of this discrete Laplacian under the perturbation of the sampled manifold becomes important for its practical usage. Previous results showed that the spectra of both the manifold Laplacian and discrete Laplacian are stable when the perturbation is ``nice'' in the sense that it is restricted to a diffeomorphism with minor area distortion. However, this forbids, for example, small topological changes. We study the stability of the spectrum of the weighted graph Laplacian under more general perturbations. In particular, we allow arbitrary, including topological, changes to the hidden manifold as long as they are localized in the ambient space and the area distortion is small. Manifold Laplacians may change dramatically in this case. Nevertheless, we show that the weighted graph Laplacians computed from two sets of points, uniformly randomly sampled from a manifold and a perturbed version of it, have similar spectra. The distance between the two spectra can be bounded in terms of the size of the perturbation and some intrinsic properties of the original manifold. Animating bubble interactions in a liquid foam O. Busaryev, T. K. Dey, H. Wang, and R. Zhong. (SIGGRAPH 2012), ACM Trans. Graphics, Vol. 31 (4), 2012. [ Video link] Bubbles and foams are important features of liquid surface phenomena, but they are difficult to animate due to their thin films and complex interactions in the real world. In particular, small bubbles (having diameter <1cm) in a dense foam are highly affected by surface tension, so their shapes are much less deformable compared with larger bubbles. Under this small bubble assumption, we propose a more accurate and efficient particle-based algorithm to simulate bubble dynamics and interactions. The key component of this algorithm is an approximation of foam geometry, by treating bubble particles as the sites of a weighted Voronoi diagram. The connectivity information provided by the Voronoi diagram allows us to accurately model various interaction effects among bubbles. Using Voronoi cells and weights, we can also explicitly address the volume loss issue in foam simulation, which is a common problem in previous approaches. Under this framework, we present a set of bubble interaction forces to handle miscellaneous foam behaviors, including foam structure under Plateau's laws, clusters formed by liquid surface bubbles, bubble-liquid and bubble-solid coupling, bursting and coalescing. Our experiment shows that this method can be straightforwardly incorporated into existing liquid simulators, and it can efficiently generate realistic foam animations, some of which have never been produced in graphics before. Feature-Preserving reconstruction of singular surfaces T. K. Dey, X. Ge, Q. Que, I. Safa, L. Wang, Y. Wang. Computer Graphics Forum, Vol. 31 (5), 1787--1796, special issue of Eurographics Sympos. Geometry Processing (SGP 2012).\u00a0[ Talk slides ] Reconstructing a surface mesh from a set of discrete point samples is a fundamental problem in geometric modeling. It becomes challenging in presence of `singularities' such as boundaries, sharp features, and non-manifolds. A few of the current research in reconstruction have addressed handling some of these singularities, but a unified approach to handle them all is missing. In this paper we allow the presence of various singularities by requiring that the sampled object is a collection of smooth surface patches with boundaries that can meet orintersect. Our algorithm first identifies and reconstructs the features where singularities occur. Next, it reconstructs the surface patches containing these feature curves. The identification and reconstruction of feature curves are achieved by a novel combination of the Gaussian weighted graph Laplacian and the Reeb graphs. The global reconstruction is achieved by a method akin to the well known Cocone reconstruction, but with weighted Delaunay triangulation that allows protecting the feature samples with balls. We provide various experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature-preserving singular surface reconstruction algorithm. Topological Persistence for circle valued maps D. Burghelea and T. K. Dey. Discrete & Computational Geometry, Volume 50, No. 1 (2013), 69--98.\u00a0 Also in arXiv:1104.5646 . April, 2011. We study circle valued maps and consider the persistence\u00a0 of the homology of their fibers. The outcome is a finite collection of computable invariants\u00a0 which answer the basic questions on persistence and in addition encode the topology of the source space and its relevant subspaces. Unlike persistence of real valued maps, circle valued maps enjoy a different class of invariants celled Jordan cells in addition to bar codes. We establish a relation between the homology of the source space and of its relevant subspaces with these invariants and provide a new algorithm to compute these invariants from an input matrix that encodes a circle valued map on an input simplicial complex. Also see how it all started: arXiv:1012.3763 , 2010. Eigen deformation of 3D models T. K. Dey, P. Ranjan and Y. Wang. Proc. Computer Graphics International (CGI 2012). The Visual Computer Volume 28, Numbers 6-8 (2012), 585-595, DOI: 10.1007/s00371-012-0705-0\u00a0 [ Talk slides ] [ Video] Recent advances in mesh deformation have been dominated by two techniques: one uses an interactive structure like a cage which transfers the user intended moves to the mesh, the other lest the user to impart the moves to the mesh directly. The former one lets the user deform the model in real-time and also preserves the shape with sophisticated techniques like Green Coordinates. The direct techniques on the other hand free the user from the burden of creating an appropriate cage though they take more computing time to solve larger non-linear optimizations. It would be ideal to develop a cage-free technique that provides real-time defoirmation while respecting the local geometry. Using a simple eigen-framework we devise such a technique. Our framework creates an implicit skeleton automatically. The user only specifies the motion in a simple and intuitive manner, and our algorithm computes a deformation whose quality is similar to that of the cage-based scheme with Green Coordinates. Annotating simplices with a homology basis and its applications O. Busaryev, S. Cabello, C. Chen, T. K. Dey, and Y. Wang. 13th Scandinavian Sympos. Workshops Algorithm Theory (SWAT 2012). Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 7357, 2012, pp 189-200. [ Talk slides ] Earlier arxiv version arXiv:1107.3793v2 Let K be a simplicial complex and g the dimension of its p-th homology group H_p(K) defined with Z_2 coefficients. We show that we can compute a basis H of H_p(K) and annotate each p-simplex of K with a binary vector of length g with the following property: the annotations, summed over all p-simplices in any p-cycle z, provide the coordinate vector of the homology class [z] in the basis H. The basis and the annotations for all simplices can be computed in O(n^{\\omega}) time, where n is the size of K and \\omega<2.376 is a quantity so that two nxn\u00a0 matrices can be multiplied in O(n^{\\omega}) time. The pre-computation of annotations permits answering queries about the independence or the triviality of p-cycles efficiently. Using annotations of edges in 2-complexes, we derive better algorithms for computing optimal basis and optimal homologous cycles in 1-dimensional homology. Specifically, for computing an optimal basis of H_1(K),we improve the time complexity known for the problem from O(n^4) to O(n^{\\omega}+n^2g^{\\omega-1}). Here n denotes the size of the 2-skeleton of K and g the rank of H_1(K). Computing an optimal cycle homologous to a given 1-cycle is NP-hard even for surfaces and an algorithm taking 2^{O(g)}n\\log n time is known for surfaces. We extend this algorithm to work with arbitrary 2-complexes in O(n^{\\omega})+2^{O(g)}n^2\\log n time using annotations. Also see this technical report for a more practical algorithm. Localized Delaunay refinement for volumes T. K. Dey and A. G. Slatton.\u00a0 Computer Graphics Forum, Vol 30 (5), 1417--1426. Special issue Proc. of Eurographics Sympos. Geometry Processing (SGP 2011). [ Web-page ] [ Talk slides ] [ Software ] Delaunay refinement, recognized as a versatile tool for meshing a variety of geometries, has the deficiency that it does not scale well with increasing mesh size. The bottleneck can be traced down to the memory usage of 3D Delaunay triangulations. Recently an approach has been suggested to tackle this problem for the specific case of smooth surfaces by subdividing the sample set in an octree and then refining each subset individually while ensuring {\\em termination} and {\\em consistency}. We extend this to localized refinement of volumes, which brings about some new challenges. We show how these challenges can be met with simple steps while retaining provable guarantees, and that our algorithm scales many folds better than a state-of-the-art meshing tool provided by CGAL. Also, see the paper below on localized Delaunay refinement for surfaces. Reeb graphs: approximation and persistence T. K. Dey and Y. Wang. \u00a0Proc. 27th Annu. Sympos. Comput. Geom. (SOCG 2011), 226--235.\u00a0 Extended version in Discrete & Computational Geometry, Vol. 49 (2013),\u00a0 46--73. [ Extended version ] Given a continuous function f: X-> R on a topological space X, its {\\em level set} f^{-1}(a) changes continuously as the real value a changes. Consequently, the connected components in the level sets appear, disappear, split and merge. \u00a0The Reeb graph of f summarizes this information into a graph structure. Previous work on Reeb graph mainly focused on its efficient computation. In this paper, we initiate the study of two important aspects of the Reeb graph which can facilitate its \u00a0broader applications in shape and data analysis. The first one is the approximation of the Reeb graph of a function on a smooth compact manifold M without boundary. The approximation is computed from a set of points P sampled from M. By leveraging a relation between the Reeb graph and the so-called {\\em vertical homology group}, as well as between cycles in M and in a Rips complex\u00a0 constructed from P, we compute the H_1-homology of the Reeb graph from P. It takes O(n \\log n) expected time, where n is the size of the 2-skeleton of the Rips complex. As a by-product, when M is an orientable 2-manifold, we also obtain an efficient near-linear time (expected) algorithm to compute the rank of H_1(M) from point data. The best known previous algorithm for this problem takes O(n^3) time for point data. The second aspect concerns the definition and computation of the \\emph{persistent Reeb graph homology} for a sequence of Reeb graphs defined on a filtered space. For a piecewise-linear function defined on a filtration of a simplicial complex K, our algorithm computes all persistent H_1-homology for the Reeb graphs in O(n n_e^3) time, where n is the size of the 2-skeleton and n_e is the number of edges in K. Localized Delaunay refinement for sampling and meshing. [ Talk slides ][ Web-page ][ Software ] T. K. Dey, J. A. Levine, and A. Slatton. \u00a0Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 29 (5)(2010), 1723--1732. \u00a0Specail issue of Proc. Eurographics Sympos. Geometry Processing. (SGP 2010). [ Extended version ] The technique of Delaunay refinement has been recognized as a versatile tool to generate Delaunay meshes of a variety of geometries. Despite its usefulness, it suffers from one lacuna that limits its application. It does not scale well with the mesh size. As the sample point set grows, the Delaunay triangulation starts stressing the available memory space which ultimately stalls any effective progress. A natural solution to the problem is to maintain the point set in clusters and run the refinement on each individual cluster. However, this needs a careful point insertion strategy and a balanced coordination among the neighboring clusters to ensure consistency across individual meshes. We design an octtree based localized Delaunay refinement method for meshing surfaces in three dimensions which meets these goals. We prove that the algorithm terminates and provide guarantees about structural properties of the output mesh. Experimental results show that the method can avoid memory thrashing while computing large meshes and thus scales much better than the standard Delaunay refinement method. Persistent heat signature for pose-oblivious matching of incomplete models. [ Talk slides ] T. K. Dey, K. Li, C. Luo, P. Ranjan, I. Safa, and Y. Wang. \u00a0Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 29 (5) (2010), 1545--1554. Special isue of\u00a0 Proc. Sympos. Geometry Processing. (SGP 2010). Although understanding of shape features in the context of shape matching and retrieval has made considerable progress in recent years, the case for partial and incomplete models in presence of pose variations still begs a robust and efficient solution. A signature that encodes features at multi-scales in a pose invariant manner is more appropriate for this case. The Heat Kernel Signature function from spectral theory exhibits this multi-scale property. We show how this concept can be merged with the persistent homology to design a novel efficient pose-oblivious matching algorithm for all models, be they partial, incomplete, or complete. We make the algorithm scalable so that it can handle large data sets. Several test results show the robustness of our approach. Tracking a generator by persistence. O. Busaryev, T. K. Dey, and Y. Wang. \u00a0 16th Annu. Internat. Computating and Combinatorics Conf. (COCOON 2010), 278--287. \u00a0Journal version in Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Applications, Vol 2, Issue 4, 2010, 539--552. DOI:10.1142/S1793830910000875. The persistent homology provides a mathematical tool to describe ``features\" in a principle manner. The persistence algorithm proposed by Edelsbrunner et al. [5] can compute not only the persistent homology for a filtered simplicial complex, but also representative generating cycles for persistent homology groups. However, if there are dynamic changes either in the filtration or in the underlying simplicial complex, the representative generating cycle can change wildly. In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking generating cycles with temporal coherence. Specifically, our goal is to track a chosen essential generating cycle so that the changes in it are ``local\". This requires reordering simplices in the filtration, To handle reordering operations. we build upon the matrix framework proposed by Cohen-Steiner et al.[3] to swap two consecutive simplices, so that we can process a reordering directly. We present an application showing how our algorithm can track an essential cycle in a complex constructed out of a point cloud data. Optimal homologous cycles, total unimodularity, and linear programming. T. K. Dey, A. Hirani, and B. Krishnamoorthy. \u00a0 SIAM J. Computing, Vol. 40, pp 1026--1044. Prelim. version in 42nd ACM Sympos. Comput. Theory (STOC 2010), 221--230. arXiv:1001.0338v1[math.AT], 2nd January, 2010. [ web-page ] [ combined talk-slides ] Given a simplicial complex with weights on its simplices, and a nontrivial cycle on it, we are interested in finding the cycle with minimal weight which is homologous to the given one. Assuming that the homology is defined with integer (Z) coefficients, we show the following (Theorem 5.2): For a finite simplicial complex K of dimension greater than p, the boundary matrix [d_(p+1)] is totally unimodular if and only if H_p(L,L_0) is torsion-free for all pure subcomplexes L_0, L in K of dimension p and p+1 respectively where L_0\\subset L. Because of the total unimodularity of the boundary matrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integer programming problem, as a linear program and obtain integer solution. Thus the problem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in polynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent result which says that the problem is NP-hard under Z_2 coefficients which, being a field, is in general easier to deal with. One consequence of our result, among others, is that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal 2-cycle in a given homology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in R^3. Our optimization approach can also be used for various related problems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous to a given one when they are not cycles.

[ web-page ] \u00a0[ software ] [ talk-slides ] Inference of topological and geometric attributes of a hidden manifold from its point data is a fundamental problem arising in many scientific studies and engineering applications. In this paper we present an algorithm to compute a set of cycles from a point data that presumably sample a smooth manifold M\\subset R^d. These cycles approximate a shortest basis of the one dimensional homology group H_1(M) over coefficients in finite field Z_2.\u00a0 Previous results addressed the issue of computing the rank of the homology groups from point data, but there is no result on approximating the shortest basis of a manifold from its point sample. In arriving our result, we also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing a shortest basis of H_1(K) for any finite simplicial complex K whose edges have non-negative weights. Convergence, Stability, and Discrete Approximation of Laplace Spectra T. K. Dey, P. Ranjan, and Y. Wang. \u00a0 Proc. ACM/SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2010), 650--663. Paper with a minor correction. Spectral methods have been widely used in a broad range of applications fields. One important object involved in such methods is the Laplace-Beltrami operator of a manifold. Indeed, a variety of work in graphics and geometric optimization uses the eigen-structures (i.e., the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) of the Laplace operator. Applications include mesh smoothing, compression, editing, shape segmentation, matching, parameterization, and so on. While the Laplace operator is defined (mathematically) for a smooth domain, these applications often approximate a smooth manifold by a discrete mesh. The spectral structure of the manifold Laplcian is estimated from some discrete Laplace operator constructed from this mesh. In this paper, we study the important question of how well the specturm computed from the discrete mesh approximates the true spectrum of the manifold Lplacian. We exploit a recent result on mesh Laplacian and provide the first convergence result to relate the spectrum constructed from a general mesh (approximating an m-manifold embedded in R^d) with the true spectrum. We also study how stable these eigenvalues and their discrete approximations are when the underlying manifold is perturbed, and provide explicit bounds for the Laplacian spectra of two ``close\" manifolds, as well as a convergence result for their discrete approximations. Finally, we present various experimental results to demonstrate that these discrete spectra are both accurate and robust in practice. Repairing and meshing imperfect shapes with Delaunay refinement O. Busaryev, T. K. Dey, J. A. Levine. \u00a0 Proc.\u00a0 SIAM/ACM Joint Conf. Geometric and Physical Modeling (SPM 2009), 25--33. As a direct consequence of software quirks, designer errors, and representation flaws, often three-dimensional shapes are stored in formats that introduce inconsistencies such as small gaps and overlaps between surface patches. We present a new algorithm that simultaneously repairs imperfect geometry and topology while generating Delaunay meshes of these shapes. At the core of this approach is a meshing algorithm for input shapes that are piecewise smooth complexes (PSCs), a collection of smooth surface patches meeting at curves non-smoothly or in\u00a0 non-manifold configuarations. Guided by a user tolerance parameter, we automatically merge nearby components while building a Delaunay mesh that has many of these errors fixed. Experimental evidence is provided to show the results of our algorithm on common computer-aided design (CAD) formats. Our algorithm may \u00a0also be used to simplify shapes by removing small features which would require an excessive number of elements to preserve them in the output mesh. Note: One of the main ingredients of this paper is our PSC meshing paper . Isotopic Reconstruction of Surfaces with Boundaries T. K. Dey, K. Li., E. A. Ramos, and R. Wenger. \u00a0 Proc.\u00a0 Sympos. Geom. Processing.(SGP09), special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, Vol. 28, No. 5 (2009), 1371--1382.[ Web-page ] [ Software ] [ talk-slide ] [ Video ] We present an algorithm for the reconstruction of a surface with boundaries (including a non-orientable one) in three dimensions from a sufficiently dense sample. It is guaranteed that the output is isotopic to the unknown sampled surface. No previously known algorithm guarantees isotopic or homeomorphic reconstruction of surfaces with boundaries. Our algorihtm is surprisingly simple. It `peels' slivers greedily from an alpha-complex of a sample of the surface. No other post-processing is necessary. We provide several experimental results from an implementation of our basic algorithm and also a modified version of it. Cut Locus and Topology from Surface Point Data. T. K. Dey, K. Li. Proc. 25th Ann. Sympos. Comput. Geom.(SOCG09), 2009, 125--134. A cut locus of a point in a compact Riemannian manifold M is defined as the set of points where minimizing geodesics issued from p stop being minimizing. It is known that a cut locus contains most of the topological information of M. Our goal is to utilize this property of cut loci to decipher the topology of M from a point sample. Recently it has been shown that Rips complexes can be built from \u00a0a point sample P of M systematically to compute the Betti numbers, the rank of the homology groups of M. Rips complexes can be computed easily and therefore are favored over others such as restricted Delaunay, alpha, Cech, and witness complex. However, the sizes of the Rips complexes tend to be large. Since the dimension of a cut locus is lower than that of the manifold M, a subsample of P approximating the cut locus is usually much smaller in size and hence admits a relatively smaller Rips complex. In this paper we explore the above approach for point data sampled from surfaces embedded in any high dimensional Euclidean space. We present an algorithm that computes a subsample P' of a sample P of a 2-manifold where P' approximates a cut locus. Empirical results show that the first Betti number of M can be computed from Rips complexes built on these subsamples. The sizes of these Rips complexes are much smaller than the one built on the original sample of M. Our first attempt on a related topic was the following paper: Topology from Data via Geodesic Complexes . T. K. Dey and K. Li. Tech Report OSU-CISRC-3/09-TR05. Delaunay meshing of piecewise smooth complexes without expensive predicates. T. K. Dey, J. A. Levine. \u00a0Algorithms, vol. 2, issue 4 (2009), 1327--1349.\u00a0doi:10.3390/a2041327 Tech Report, OSU-CISRC-7/08-TR40, July 2008. [ Video ][ Software ][Talk-slide][ Web-page ] Recently a Delaunay refinement algorithm has been proposed that can mesh piecewise smooth complexes which include polyhedra, smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces, and non-manifolds. However, this algorihtm employs domain dependent numerical predicates, some of which could be computationally expensive and hard to implement. In this paper we develop a refinement strategy that eliminates these complicated domain dependent predicates. As a result we obtain a meshing algorithm that is practical and implementation-friendly. Persistence-based Handle and Tunnel Loops Computation Revisited for Speed Up. T. K. Dey and K. Li. Shape Modeling International (SMI09), 2009. Special issue of Computer & Graphics, Article in press, doi:10.1016/j.cag.2009.03.008 . [ Software ] Loops in surfaces associated with topological features such as handles and tunnels are important entities in many applications including surface parameterization, feature identification, and topological simplification. Recently, a persistent homology based algorithm has been proposed to compute them. The algorithm has several advantages including its simplicity, combinatorial nature and independence from computing other extra structures. In this paper, we propose changes to this loop computation algorithm based on some novel observations. These changes reduce the computation time of the algorithm dramatically. In particular, our experimental results show that the suggested changes achieve considerable speed up for large data sets without sacrificing loop qualities. Note: This is a follow-up paper of our SIGGRAPH08 paper below. Computing Geometry-aware Handle and Tunnel Loops in 3D Models. T. K. Dey, K. Li, J. Sun, and D. Cohen-Steiner.\u00a0SIGGRAPH 2008, 45:1--45:9. [ Video ][ Software ][ Talk-slide ][ Web-page ] Many applications such as topology repair, model editing, surface parameterization, and feature recognition benefit from computing loops on surfaces that wrap around their `handles' and `tunnels'. Computing such loops while optimizing their geometric lengths is difficult. On the other hand, computing such loops without considering geometry is easy but may not be very useful. In this paper we strike a balance by computing topologically correct loops that are also geometrically relevant. Our algorithm is a novel application of the concepts from topological persistence introduced recently in computational topology. The usability of the computed loops is demonstrated with some examples in feature identification and topology simplification. Note: See the paper below On computing handle and tunnel loops for our first attempt on this problem. Recursive geometry of the flow complex and topology of the flow complex filtration . K. Buchin, T. K. Dey, J. Giesen, and M. John. Comput. Geom. Theory Application. (2008), vol. 40, 115--157. The flow complex is a geometric structure, similar to the Delaunay tessellation, to organize a set of (weighted) points in R^k. Flow shapes are topological spaces correspoding to substructures of the flow complex. The flow complex and flow shapes have found applications in surface reconstruction, shape matching, and molecular modeling. In this article we give an algorithm for computing the flow complex of weighted points in any dimension. The algorithm reflects the recursive structure of the flow complex. On the basis of the algorithm we establish a topological similarity between flow shapes and the nerve of a corresponding ball set, namely homotopy equivalence. This paper grew out of: Alpha-Shapes and Flow Shapes are Homotopy Equivalent. T. K. Dey, J. Giesen and M. John. Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2003) 493-502 Normal variation with adaptive feature size (2007) The proof of the normal variation lemma (Lemma 2) in\u00a0 Amenta-Bern paper ``Surface reconstruction by Voronoi filtering\", DCG, 1999, pg. 481-504, is not correct (which also appears in my book on reconstruction). In this short note we fix the problem and improve the bound on the normal variation. This should improve various bounds derived afterwards using the normal variation result. Maintaining Deforming Surface Meshes S.-W. Cheng and T. K. Dey. Proc. 19th ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2008) (2008), 112--121. We present a method to maintain a mesh approximating a deforming surface, which is specified by a dense set of sample points. We identify a reasonable motion model for which a provably good surface mesh can be maintained. Our algorithm determines the appropriate times at which the mesh is updated to maintain a good approximation. The updates use simple primitives, and no costly computation such as line-surface intersection is necessary. Point insertions and deletions are allowed at the updates. Each update takes time linear in the size of the current sample set plus the new sample points inserted. We also construct examples for which, under the same model, no other algorithm makes asymptotically fewer changes to the mesh than our algorithm. This paper is based on the following flip paper available as a preprint from computational geoemtry arxiv. Delaunay Edge Flips in Dense Surface Triangulations S.-W. Cheng and T. K. Dey. Pre-print arXiv:cs.CG/0712.1959, 2007.\u00a0short version in EuroCG 2008. Note: We are retracting this result due to a bug in a Lemma (Lemma 3.1). We are trying to salvage the other results without using Lemma 3.1. The abstract was: Delaunay flip is an elegant, simple tool to convert a triangulation of a point set to its Delaunay triangulation. The technique has been researched extensively for full dimensional triangulations of point sets. However, an important case of triangulations which are not full dimensional is surface triangulations in three dimensions. In this paper we address the question of converting a surface triangulation to a subcomplex of the Delaunay triangulation with edge flips. We show that the surface triangulations which closely approximate a smooth surface with uniform density can be transformed to a Delaunay triangulation with a simple edge flip algorithm. The condition on uniformity becomes less stringent with increasing density of the triangulation. If the condition is dropped completely, the flip algorithm still terminates although the output surface triangulation becomes ``almost Delaunay\" instead of exactly Delaunay. A practical Delaunay meshing algorithm for a large class of domains S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey, and J. A. Levine.\u00a0 Proc. 16th\u00a0 Internat. Meshing Roundtable (IMR 2007), 477--494. [Talk slides ] Recently a Delaunay refinement algorithm has been proposed that can mesh domains as general as piecewise smooth complexes [CDR07]. In this paper we introduce a novel modification of the algorithm\u00a0 to make it implementable in practice. In particular, we replace four tests of the original algorithm with only a single test that is easy to implement. The algorithm has the following guarantees. The output mesh restricted to each manifold element in the complex is a manifold with proper incidence relations. More importantly, with increasing level of refinement which can be controlled by an input parameter, the output mesh becomes homeomorphic to the input while preserving all input features. Implementation results on a disparate array of input domains are presented to corroborate our claims. For the theory see the following paper: Theory of a practical Delaunay meshing algorithm for a large class of domains . S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey and J. Levine.

Journal version is in Computer-Aided Design, in press, doi:10.1016/j.cad.2009.01.001 . [Talk slides] HandleTunnel software Many applications seek to identify features like `handles' and `tunnels' in a shape bordered by a surface embedded in three dimensions. To this end we define handle and tunnel loops on surfaces which can help identifying these features. We show that a closed surface of genus g always has g handle and g tunnel loops induced by the embedding. For a class of shapes that retract to graphs, we characterize these loops by a linking condition with these graphs. These characterizations lead to algorithms for detection and generation of these loops. We provide an impementation with applications to feature detection and topology simplification to show the effectiveness of the method. Stability of critical points with interval persistence T. K. Dey and R. Wenger. Discrete & Computational Geometry , vol 38 (2007), 479--512. Tech Report OSU-CISRC-4/06-TR47, April 2006. Scalar functions defined on a topological space T are at the core of many applications such as shape matching, visualization, and physical simulations. Topological persistence is an approach to characterizing these functions. It measures how long topological structures in the level sets {x in T : f(x) <= c} persist as c changes. Recently it was shown that the critical values defining a topological structure with relatively large persistence remain almost unaffected by small perturbations. This result suggests that topological persistence is a good measure for matching and comparing scalar functions. We extend these results to critical points in the domain by redefining persistence and critical points and replacing sub-level sets {x in T : f(x) <= c} with interval sets {x in T : a<=f(x)< b}. With these modifications we establish a stability result for critical points. This result is strengthened for maxima that can be used for matching two scalar functions. Delaunay meshing of isosurfaces T. K. Dey and J. A. Levine. Proc. Shape Modeling International (SMI 2007), 241--250. DelIso software We present an isosurface meshing algorithm DelIso, based on the Delaunay refinement paradigm. This paradigm has been successfully applied to mesh a variety of domains with guarantees for topology, geometry, mesh gradedness, and triangle shape. A restricted Delaunay triangulation, dual of the intersection between the surface and the three dimensional Voronoi diagram, is often the main ingredient in Delaunay refinement. Computing and storing three dimensional Voronoi/Delaunay diagrams become bottlenecks for Delaunay refinement techniques since isosurface computations generally have large input datasets and output meshes. A highlight of our algorithm is that we find a simple way to recover the restricted Delaunay triangulation of the surface without computing the full 3D structure. We employ techniques for efficient ray tracing of isosurfaces to generate surface sample points, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our implementation on a variety of volume datasets. Delaunay refinement for piecewise smooth complexes S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey, and E. A. Ramos. Proc. 18th Annu. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2007), 1096--1105. Journal Version in Discrete & Comput. Geom., 2008, article in press. doi.10.1007/s00454-008-9109-3 . Extended Full Version We present a Delaunay refinement algorithm for meshing a piecewise smooth complex in three dimensions with correct topology. The small angles between the tangents of two meeting manifold patches pose difficulty. We protect these regions with weighted points. The weights are chosen to mimic the local feature size and to satisfy a Lipschitz-like property. A Delaunay refinement using the weighted Voronoi diagram is shown to terminate with the recovery of the topology of the input. To this end, we present new concepts and results including a new definition of local feature size and a proof for a generalized topological ball property. Defining and computing curve-skeletons with medial geodesic function T. K. Dey and J. Sun. Proc. Sympos. Geometry Processing (SGP 2006), 143--152. CurveSkel Software Many applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, visualization, and computer vision benefit from a reduced representation called curve-skeletons of a shape. These are curves possibly with branches which compactly represent the shape geometry and topology. The lack of a proper mathematical definition has been a bottleneck in developing and applying the curve-skeletons. A set of desirable properties of these skeletons has been identified and the existing algorithms try to satisfy these properties mainly through a procedural definition. We define a function called medial geodesic on the medial axis which leads to a mathematical definition and an approximation algorithm for curve-skeletons. Empirical study shows that the algorithm is robust against noise, operates well with a single user parameter, and produces curve-skeletons with the desirable properties. Moreover, the curve-skeletons can be associated with additional attributes that follow naturally from the definition. These attributes capture shape eccentricity, a local measure of how far a shape is away from a tubular one. Identifying flat and tubular regions of a shape by unstable manifolds S. Goswami, T. K. Dey, and C. Bajaj. Proc. 11th ACM Sympos. Solid Modeling Applications (SPM 2006), 27--37. We present an algorithm to identify the flat and tubular regions of a three dimensional shape from its point sample. We consider the distance function to the input point cloud and the Morse structure induced by it on R^3. Specifically we focus on the index 1 and index 2 saddle points and their unstable manifolds. The unstable manifolds of index 2 saddles are one dimensional whereas those of index 1 saddles are two dimensional. Mapping these unstable manifolds back onto the surface, we get the tubular and flat regions. The computations are carried out on the Voronoi diagram of the input points by approximating the unstable manifolds with Voronoi faces. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several point sampled objects. Normal and feature approximations from noisy point clouds . T. K. Dey and J. Sun. \u00a0Proc.\u00a0FST&TCS 2006, LNCS 4337, \u00a021--32. NormFet software We consider the problem of approximating normal and feature sizes approximations of a surface from point cloud data that may be noisy. These problems are central to many applications dealing with point cloud data. In the noise-free case, the normals and feature sizes can be approximated by the centers of a set of unique large Delaunay balls called polar balls. In presence of noise, polar balls do not necessarily remain large and hence their centers may not be good for normal and feature approximations. Earlier works suggest that some large Delaunay balls can play the role of polar balls. However, these results were short in explaining how the big Delaunay balls should be chosen for reliable approximations and how the approximation error depends on various factors. We provide new analyses that fill these gaps. In particular, they lead to new algorithms for practical and reliable normal and feature approximations. Anisotropic surface meshing S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey and E. A. Ramos. Proc. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2006), 202--211. We study the problem of triangulating a smooth closed implicit surface S endowed with a 2D metric tensor that varies over S. This is commonly known as the anisotropic surface meshing problem. We extend the 2D metric tensor naturally to 3D and employ the 3D anisotropic Voronoi diagram of a set P of samples on S to triangulate S. We prove that a restricted dual, Mesh P, \u00a0is a valid triangulation homeomorphic to S under appropriate conditions. We also develop an algorithm for constructing P and Mesh P. \u00a0In addition to being homeomorphic to S, each triangle in Mesh P is well-shaped when measured using the 3D metric tensors of its vertices. Users can set upper bounds on the anisotropic edge lengths and the angles between the surface normals at vertices and the normals of incident triangles (measured both isotropically and anisotropically). An Adaptive MLS Surface for Reconstruction with Guarantees. T. K. Dey and J. Sun. Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP 2005), 43--52. Conference version. Extended version. Technical Report OSU-CISRC-4-05-TR26, April, 2005. AMLS Software Recent work have shown that moving least squares (MLS) surfaces can be used effectively to reconstruct surfaces from possibly noisy point cloud data. Several variants of MLS surfaces have been suggested, some of which have been analyzed theoretically for guarantees. These analyses, so far, have assumed uniform sampling density. We propose a new variant of the MLS surface that, for the first time, incorporates local feature sizes in its formulation, and we analyze it for reconstruction guarantees using a non-uniform sampling density. The proposed variant of the MLS surface has several computational advantages over existing MLS methods. Also see Extremal Surface Based Projections Converge and Reconstruct with Isotopy. T. K.

Eurographics Sympos. on Point-Based Graphics (2005), 39--46. Many applications that process a point cloud data benefit from a reliable normal estimation step. Given a point cloud presumably sampled from an unknown surface, the problem is to estimate the normals of the surface at the data points. Two approaches, one based on numerical optimizations and another based on Voronoi diagrams are known for the problem. Variations of numerical approaches work well even when point clouds are contaminated with noise. Recently a variation of the Voronoi based method is proposed for noisy point clouds. The centrality of the normal estimation step in point cloud processing begs a thorough study of the two approaches so that one knows which approach is appropriate for what circumstances. This paper presents such results. Polygonal Surface Remeshing with Delaunay Refinement T. K. Dey, G. Li and T. Ray. Proc.14th Internat. Meshing Roundtable, (IMR 2005), 343--361. Journal version in Engineering with Computers, vol. 26, page 289--301, 2010. Conference version Extended version SurfRemesh software Polygonal meshes are used to model smooth surfaces in many applications. Often these meshes need to be remeshed for improving the quality, density or gradedness. We apply the Delaunay refinement paradigm to design a provable algorithm for isotropic remeshing of a polygonal mesh that approximates a smooth surface. The proofs provide new insights and our experimental results corroborate the theory. Weighted Delaunay Refinement for Polyhedra with Small Angles S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey and T. Ray. Proc.14th Internat. Meshing Roundtable\u00a0 (IMR 2005), 325--342. Recently, a provable Delaunay meshing algorithm called QMesh has been proposed for polyhedra that may have acute input angles. The algorithm guarantees bounded circumradius to shortest edge length ratio for all tetrahedra except the ones near small input angles. This guarantee eliminates or limits the occurrences of all types of poorly shaped tetrahedra except slivers. A separate technique called weight pumping is known for sliver elimination. But, allowable input for the technique so far have been periodic point sets and piecewise linear complex with non-acute input angles. In this paper, we incorporate the weight pumping method into QMesh thereby ensuring that all tetrahedra except the ones near small input angles have bounded aspect ratio. Theoretically, the algorithm has an abysmally small angle guarantee inherited from the weight pumping method. Nevertheless, our experiments show that it produces better angles in practice. Critical points of distance to an epsilon-sampling of a surface and flow-complex- base d surface reconstruction. T. K. Dey, J. Giesen, E. A. Ramos and B. Sadri. Proc. 21st Annu. Sympos. Comput.\u00a0 Geom., (SOCG 2005), 218--227. ( Invited Journal version in Internat. J. Comput. Geom. Applications, Vol 18, 2008, 29--61.) Extended version. The distance function to surfaces in three dimensions plays a key role in many geometric modeling applications such as medial axis approximations, surface reconstructions, offset computations, feature extractions and others. In most of these cases, the distance function to the surface is approximated by a discrete distance function where the distances are measured from a discrete sample of the surface. The critical points of the distance function determines the topology of the geometric structures in question. Howvere, no theoretical result exists linking the sampling and the critical point structures of the distance functions. We provide this link by showing that the critical points of the discrete distance function either lie very close to the surface or near the medial axis both quantified with the sampling density. One implication of this result is that known Morse theory based surface reconstruction algorithms do indeed approximate the surface geometrically. Manifold Reconstruction from Point Samples Siu-Wing Cheng, T. K. Dey and E. A. Ramos. Proc. ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms, (SODA 2005), 1018--1027. Extended Abstract See also [ Talk slides] We present an algorithm to \"reconstruct\" a smooth k-dimensional manifold M embedded in an Euclidean space R^d from a \"sufficiently dense\" point sample from the manifold. The algorithm outputs a simplicial manifold that is homeomorphic and geometrically close to M. The running time is O(nlogn) where n is the number of points in the sample (the multiplicative constant depends exponentially on the dimension though). Delaunay Triangulations Approximate Anchor Hulls T. K. Dey, Joachim Giesen and Samrat Goswami. Comput. Geom. Theory Applications, vol. 36 (2006), 131--143. (prelim. version in (SODA 2005), 1028-1037). Recent results establish that a subset of the Voronoi diagram of a point set that is sampled from a smooth boundary of a shape approximates the medial axis. The corresponding question for the dual Delaunay triangulation is not addressed in the literature. We show that, for two dimensional shapes, the Delaunay triangulation approximates a specific structure which we call anchor hulls . As an application we demonstrate that our approximating result is useful for the problem of shape matching. Quality meshing for polyhedra with small angles S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey, E. Ramos and T. Ray. International J. Comput. Geom. & Applications , Vol. 15, No. 4 (2005), \u00a0421--461. Prelim. version in (SOCG 2004). Extended version QualMesh Software We present an algorithm to compute a Delaunay mesh conforming to a polyhedron possibly with small input angles. The radius-edge ratio of most output tetrahedra are bounded by a constant, except possibly those that are provably close to small angles. Further, the mesh is graded, that is, edge lengths are at least a constant fraction of the local feature sizes at the edge endpoints. Unlike a previous algorithm, this algorithm is simple to implement as it avoids computing local feature sizes and protective zones explicitly. Our experimental results confirm our claims and show that few skinny tetrahedra remain. Sampling and meshing a surface with guaranteed topology and geometry S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey, E. Ramos and T. Ray. Proc. 20th Sympos. Comput. Geom. (SOCG 2004), 280--289 . Extended version, in SIAM Journal Computing, Vol. 37 (2007), 1199--1227. This paper presents an algorithm for sampling and triangulating a smooth surface in R 3 where the triangulation is homeomorphic to the surface. The only assumption we make is that the input surface representation is amenable to certain types of computations, namely computations of the intersection points of a line with the surface, computations of the critical points of some height functions defined on the surface and its restriction to a plane, and computations of some silhouette points. The algorithm ensures bounded aspect ratio, size optimality, and smoothness of the output triangulation. Unlike previous algorithms, this algorithm does not need to compute the local feature size for generating the sample points which was a major bottleneck. Experiments show the usefulness of the algorithm in remeshing and meshing CAD surfaces that are piecewise smooth. Provable surface reconstruction from noisy samples T. K. Dey and S. Goswami. Computationa Geometry Theory & Applications, vol. 35, 2006, 124--141. Prelim. version in (SOCG 2004). RobustCocone software We present an algorithm for surface reconstruction in presence of noise. We show that, under a reasonable noise model, the algorithm has theoretical guarantees. Actual performance of the algorithm is illustrated by our experimental results. Approximating the Medial Axis from the Voronoi Diagram with a Convergence Guarantee T. K. Dey and W. Zhao. Algorithmica, vol. 38, 2003, 179--200. Medial Software The medial axis of a surface in 3D is the closure of all points that have two or more closest points on the surface. It is an essential geometric structure in a number of applications involving 3D geometric shapes. Since exact computation of the medial axis is difficult in general, efforts continue to improve their approximations. Voronoi diagrams turn out to be useful for this approximation. Although it is known that Voronoi vertices for a sample of points from a curve in 2D approximate its medial axis, similar result does not hold in 3D. Recently, it has been discovered that only a subset of Voronoi vertices converge to the medial axis as sample density approaches infinity. However, most applications need a non-discrete approximation as opposed to a discrete one. To date no known algorithm can compute this approximation straight from the Voronoi diagram with a guarantee of convergence.We present such an algorithm and its convergence analysis in this paper. One salient feature of the algorithm is that it is scale and density independent. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical claims. Hierarchy of surface models and irreducible triangulation S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey and S.-H. Poon. Computational Geometry : Theory & Applications, Vol. 27, No. 2 (2004), 135--150 Given a triangulated closed surface, the problem of constructing a hierarchy of surface models of decreasing level of detail has attracted much attention in computer graphics. A hierarchy provides a view-dependent refinement and facilitates the computation of parameterization. For a triangulated closed surface of n vertices and genus g, we prove that there is a constant c>0 such that if n > c g, a greedy strategy can identify \\Theta(n) topology-preserving edge contractions that do not interfere with each other. Further, each of them affects only a constant number of triangles. Repeatedly identifying and contracting such edges produces a topology-preserving hierarchy of O(n+g^2) size and O(logn +g) depth. Although several implementations exist for constructing hierarchies, our work is the first to show that a greedy algorithm can efficiently compute a hierarchy of provably small size and low depth. When no contractible edge exists, the triangulation is irreducible. Nakamoto and Ota showed that any irreducible triangulation of an orientable 2-manifold has at most max{342g-72, 4} vertices. Uisng our proof techniques we obtain a new bound of mx{240g,4}. Shape segmentation and matching with flow discretization T. K. Dey, J. Giesen and S. Goswami. Proc. Workshop Algorithms Data Strucutres (WADS 03), LNCS 2748, F. Dehne, J.-R. Sack, M. Smid Eds., 25--36 Extended version Segmatch Software Geometric shapes are identified with their features. For computational purposes a concrete mathematical definition of features is required. In this paper we use a topological approach, namely dynamical systems, to define features of shapes. To exploit this definition algorithmically we assume that a point sample of the shape is given as input from which features of the shape have to be approximated. We translate our definition of features to the discrete domain while mimicking the set-up developed for the continuous shapes. The outcome of this approach is a clean mathematical definition of features that are efficiently computable with combinatorial algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithms segment shapes in two and three dimensions into so-called features quite effectively. Further, we develop a shape matching algorithm that takes advantage of our robust feature segmentation step. Performance of this algorithm is exhibited with experimental results. Also see the following paper: Shape segmentation and matching from noisy point clouds T. K. Dey, J. Giesen and S. Goswami. Proc. Eurographics Sympos. Point-Based Graphics (2004), Marc Alexa and S. Rusinkiewicz (eds) (2004), 193--199. Quality meshing with weighted Delaunay refinement S.-W. Cheng and T. K. Dey. SIAM J. Computing, Vol. 33 (2003), 69--93 Preliminary version in (SODA 2002). Delaunay meshes with bounded circumradius to shorten edge length ratio have been propsed in the past for quality meshing. The only poor quality tetrahedra called slivers that can occur in such a mesh can be eliminated by the sliver exudation method. This method has been shown to work for periodic point sets, but not with boundaries. Recently a randomized point-placement strategy has been proposed to remove slivers while conforming to a given boundary. In this paper we present a deterministic algorithm for generating a weighted Delaunay mesh which respects the input boundary and has no poor quality tetrahedron including slivers. As in previous work, we assume that no input angle is acute. This success is achieved by combining the weight pumping method for sliver exudation and the Delaunay refinement method for boundary conformation. Shape dimension and approximation from samples T. K. Dey, J. Giesen, S. Goswami and W. Zhao. Discrete & Comput. Geom., vol 29, 419--434 (2003) \u00a0Prelim. version in (SODA 2002). There are many scientific and engineering applications where an automatic detection of shape dimension from sample data is necessary. Topological dimensions of shapes constitute an important global feature of them. We present a Voronoi based dimension detection algorithm that assigns a dimension to a sample point which is the topological dimension of the manifold it belongs to. Based on this dimension detection, we also present an algorithm to approximate shapes of arbitrary dimension from their samples. Our empirical results with data sets in three dimensions support our theory. A simple algorithm for homeomorphic surface reconstruction N. Amenta, S. Choi, T. K. Dey and N. Leekha. Intl. Journal on Computational Geometry & Applications, vol. 12, (2002), 125--141. Prelim. version in (SOCG 2000). The problem of computing a piecewise linear approximation to a surface from a set of sample points is improtant in solid modeling, computer graphics and computer vision. A recent algorithm using the Voronoi diagram of the sample points gave a guarantee on the distance of the output surface from the original sampled surface assuming that the sample was sufficiently dense. We give a similar algorithm, simplifying the computation and the proof of the geometric guarantee. In addition, we guarantee that our output surface is homeomorphic to the original surface; to our knowledge this is the first such topological guarantee for this problem. Also see the following paper: Tight Cocone : A water-tight surface reconstructor T. K. Dey and S. Goswami. J. Computing Inform. Sci. Engin., vol. 30, (2003), 302--307. Cocone Software Dynamic skin triangulation H-L. Cheng, T. K. Dey, H. Edelsbrunner and J. Sullivan. Discrete Comput. Geom., vol. 25, (2001), 525--568 Prelim. version in (SODA 2001). This paper describes an algorithm for maintaining an approximating triangulation of a deforming surface in R 3 . The surface is the envelope of an infinite family of spheres defined and controlled by a finite collection of weighted points. The triangulation adapts dynamically to changing shape, curvature, and topology of the surface. Sliver exudation S.-W. Cheng, T. K. Dey, H. Edelsbrunner, M. A. Facello and S.-H. Teng. J. ACM, Vol. 47, (2000), 883--904 Prelim. version in (SOCG 1999). A sliver is a tetrahedron whose four vertices lie close to a plane and whose orthogonal projection to that plane is a convex quadrilateral with no short edge. Slivers are notoriously common in 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulations even for well-spaced point sets. We show that if the Delaunay triangulation has the ratio property then there is an assignment of weights so the weighted Delaunay triangulation contains no slivers. We also give an algorithm to compute such a weight assignment. A simple provable algorithm for curve reconstruction T. K. Dey and P. Kumar. Proc. 10th. ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA '99) , 1999, 893--894 We present an algorithm that provably reconstructs a curve in the framework introduced by Amenta, Bern and Eppstein. The highlights of the algorithm are: (i) it is simple, (ii) it requires a sampling density better than previously known, (iii) it can be adapted for curve reconstruction in higher dimensions straightforwardly. Topology preserving edge contraction T. K. Dey, H. Edelsbrunner, S. Guha and D. Nekhayev. Publications de l' Institut Mathematique (Beograd), Vol. 60 (80), 23--45, 1999 We study edge contractions in simplicial complexes and local conditions under which they preserve the topological type. The conditions are based on a generalized notion of boundary, which lends itself to defining a nested hierarchy of triangulable spaces measuring the distance to being a manifold. Transforming curves on surfaces T. K. Dey and S. Guha. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, vol. 58, 1999, 297--325. Preliminary version in IEEE (FOCS 1995), 266-274 We describe an optimal algorithm to decide if one closed curve on a triangulated 2-manifold can be continuously transformed to another, i.e., if they are homotopic. Suppose C_1 and C_2 are two closed curves on a surface M of genus g. Further, suppose T is a triangulation of M of size n such that C_1 and C_2 are represented as edge-vertex sequences of lengths k_1 and k_2 in T, respectively. Then, our algorithm decides if C_1 and C_2 are homotopic in O(n+k_1+k_2) time and space, provided g \\not = 2 if M is orientable, and g \\not 3, 4 if M is non-orientable. This as well implies an optimal algorithm to decide if a closed curve on a surface can be continuously contracted to a point. Except for the three low genus cases, our algorithm completes an investigation into the computational complexity of two classical problems for surfaces posed by the mathematician Max Dehn at the beginning of this century. The novelty of our approach is in the application of methods from modern combinatorial group theory. Reprint available upon request Improved bounds for planar k-sets and related problems T. K. Dey. Invited paper in a special issue of Discrete & Computational Geometry, Vol. 19, No. 3, (1998), 373-382 Prelim. version in IEEE (FOCS 1997). We prove an O(nk 1/3 ) upper bound for planar k-sets. This is the first considerable improvement on this bound after its early solutions approximately twenty seven years ago. Our proof technique also applies to improve the current bounds on the combinatorial complexities of k-levels in arrangements of line segments, k convex polygons in the union of n lines, parametric minimum spanning trees and parametric matroids in general. Extremal problems for geometric hypergraphs T. K. Dey and J. Pach. Discrete & Computational Geometry, Vol. 19, No. 4, (1998), 473--484. Preliminary version in\u00a0ISAAC 96, LNCS 1178, 105-114 A geometric hypergraph H is a collection of i-dimensional simplices, called hyperedges or, simply, edges, induced by some (i + 1)-tuples of a vertex set V in general position in d-space. The topological structure of geometric graphs, i.e., the case d = 2; i = 1, has been studied extensively, and it proved to be instrumental for the solution of a wide range of problems in combinatorial and computational geometry. They include the k-set problem, proximity questions, bounding the number of incidences between points and lines, designing various efficient graph drawing algorithms, etc. In this paper, we make an attempt to generalize some of these tools to higher dimensions. We will mainly consider extremal problems of the following type. What is the largest number of edges (i-simplices) that a geometric hypergraph of n vertices can have without containing certain forbidden configurations? In particular, we discuss the special cases when the forbidden configura\ufffd tions are k intersecting edges, k pairwise intersecting edges, k crossing edges, k pairwise crossing edges, k edges that can be stabbed by an i-flat, etc. Some of our estimates will be tight.

Aronov, A. Davis, T. K. Dey, S. P. Pal and D. C. Prasad. Discrete & Computational Geometry, Vol. 20, No. 61, (1998), 61--78. Preliminary version in 5th\u00a0SWAT, 1996, LNCS 1097, 284-295 We show that the region lit by a point light source inside a simple n-gon after at most k reflections off the boundary has combinatorial complexity O(n 2k ), for any k \u2013 1. A lower bound of \u03a9((n/k \u03b8(1)) 2k ) is also established which matches the upper bound for any fixed k. A simple near-optimal algorithm for computing the illuminated region is presented, which runs in O(n 2k log n) time and O(n 2k ) space for k > 1, and in O(n 2 log 2 n) time and O(n 2 ) space for k = 1. Counting triangle crossings and halving planes T. K. Dey and H. Edelsbrunner. Invited paper in a special issue, Discrete & Computational Geometry, Vol. 12 (1994), 281--289 Prelim. version in\u00a0SoCG 1995. Every collection of t > 2n^2 triangles with a total of n vertices in R^3 has \\Omega(t^4/n^6) crossing pairs. This implies that one of their edges meets \\Omega(t^3/n^6) of the triangles. From this it follows that n points in R^3 have only O(n^{8/3}) halving planes. Reprint available upon request On counting triangulations in d dimensions T. K. Dey. Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications, Vol. 3 (1993), 315--325 . Given a set of n labeled points on S^d, how many combinatorially different geometric triangulations for this point set are there? We show that the logarithm of this number is at most some positive constant times n^{\\floor d/2}+1. Evidence is provided that for even dimensions d the bound can be improved to some constant times n^{d/2}. Facundo M\u00e9moli single-arrow-square Manuscripts in preparation and preprints A.

David Sivakoff single-arrow-square Interacting Particle Systems and Cellular Automata An interacting particle system is a network of dynamic units in which the state of each vertex evolves stochastically in continuous time according to a local rule. Cellular automata are the deterministic, discrete time analogues of interacting particle systems. Both paradigms are commonly used as models for discrete, spatial processes, and we are typically interested in the emergence of global structure or long-time behavior as these systems evolve from a disordered initial state. Classically, the underlying topology is taken to be a lattice (such as \u2124 d ) or an infinite tree, while more recently, researchers have focused on more heterogeneous stuctures, such as random graphs. I have studied a variety of systems, which include models for epidemics [11], coupled oscillators [17, 19], opinion spreading [4], ferromagnetic spin systems [16], and systems of ballistic and annihilating particles [15, 18]. The image to the left depicts the 8-color cyclic cellular automaton [15] on a uniform random spanning tree of the 150 x 150 torus. Most vertices cease to be active early on, while rare regions of activity appear to nucleate and eventually force the entire graph to fluctuate. Neighborhood growth models This is a class of growth models in which an occupied subset of the vertices of a graph grows iteratively by including vertices whose neighborhoods contain certain patterns of occupied vertices. The simplest example is a threshold growth model called bootstrap percolation, which has a long history in both physics and mathematics. This model has received the most attention on lattices and trees with nearest neighbor connectivity. My collaborators and I initiated the study of bootstrap percolation [8] and more general neighborhood growth models [14] on subsets of the lattice with connectivity of the Hamming graph. In this setting we observe vastly different behavior than in the local-connectivity case, such as gradual phase transitions. I have also investigated bootstrap percolation on graphs with overlapping community structure [12,21], and observed that sharp, gradual and hybrid phase transitions are possible, depending on scaling between the intra- and inter-community connectivity and on the parity of the threshold parameter. The effects of heterogeneity in the growth rule or environment remain poorly understood, and I recently analyzed a bootstrap percolation model in the presence of randomly placed obstacles [20]. In three dimensions and with occupation threshold 3, we use the technology of oriented surfaces to identify a blocking structure (image to the left courtesy of A. Holroyd), which prevents occupation of the origin when the density of obstacles exceeds the cube of the density of occupied sites. Papers Preprints and Submitted Manuscripts J. Gravner and D.

Link: https://keepteaching.osu.edu/assessments Graduate Thesis/Competency Exam/Proposal The Graduate School has communicated that if your students are completing a candidacy exam, thesis oral exam, or dissertation defense, you will need to shift to a videoconference meeting format and you may do so without needing to petition. You can schedule a Zoom meeting and incorporate a very basic identity verification step to meet the Graduate School\u2019s requirements for protecting exam integrity. For undergraduate exams in this format, your department can use these same recommendations to guide its planning. Format: Use Zoom to host a defense meeting. The student\u2019s advisor should draft and sign a document verifying the student\u2019s identity as documentation of ID verification. Planning considerations: Discuss as a committee before the defense what your expectations will be and share them with your student. Expect longer delays for processing questions and providing verbal answers. If students will be expected to diagram, draw or show visual elements, make those expectations and a list of required materials available to them well ahead of time. Limitations: Zoom\u00a0videoconference meetings\u00a0require\u00a0a device with a camera and microphone and high-speed internet access. Work with your students to determine who cannot meet those requirements. If you have students who will not have Wi-Fi access for the duration of the exam, work with your department chair to find access alternatives. The Graduate School asks faculty to be as flexible as possible with their graduate students in making arrangements. Adjusted SP20\u00a0deadlines for the completion of comprehensive final oral examinations, as well as final thesis/dissertation submission and approval. \u2022 Graduate Final Oral Examinations for students graduating Spring 2020 should be completed by Friday, April 17.\u00a0 Our prior date was April 10th \u2022 Graduate Final Theses/Dissertations from students graduating Spring 2020 must be submitted and approved by the Graduate School by Friday, April 24.

Please first contact your course coordinator for the questions. If you need further help, please contact Ms. Kathryn Reeves at reeves.92@osu.edu . Also we have set up a channel at Microsoft Team ( here ) and you may find the answers to your questions there. What happens if you lose your Zoom meeting connection? Be sure to let students know this could happen; and that you will connect as soon as possible so they should stay in the zoom room until the end of the scheduled time. What if you have not heard from a student? If the student is an undergraduate student, contact the CSE undergraduate advising office for help. If the student is a graduate student, contact Kitty Reeves What if a student has bad connectivity and/or computer device issues? Flexibility is key. The idea is to help the student learn the course material as best as possible in the current challenging environment. What are some exam options in an online test taking environment?

For this week, the answer is likely unknown and still in flux. Provost Bruce McPheron emailed the evening of March 20th about some possible options but these still need to be discussed and voted on. The answer is what is currently on the syllabus until more information is known. Assure students you will let them know as soon as you know. What if a student is hoping for an incomplete grade? Incompletes options are being discussed with a possible longer period of time for the student to complete the course requirements. Be sure to contact your course coordinator and copy Kitty Reeves (reeves.92) about all incomplete grades. Final exam scheduling is still in flux. The current information is below, but keep informed and updated.

From July 1986 to December 1987 he was with the Institute of Computing Technology, Academia Sinica, Beijing. Since 1991, he has been with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Center for Cognitive Science at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, where he is currently a Professor. From October 1998 to September 1999, he was a visiting scholar in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. From October 2006 to June 2007, he was a visiting scholar at Oticon A/S , Copenhagen, Denmark. From October 2014 to De 2007, he was a visiting scholar at Oticon A/S , Copenhagen, Denmark. DeLiang Wang received the NSF Research Initiation Award in 1992 and the ONR Young Investigator Award in 1996. He received the OSU College of Engineering Lumley Research Award in 1996, 2000, 2005, and 2010. His 2005 paper, \" The time dimension for scene analysis \", received the 2007 Outstanding Paper Award from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. His 2014 paper with Yuxuan Wang and Arun Narayanan, \" On training targets for supervised speech separation \", received the 2019 Best Paper Award from the IEEE Signal Processing Society. He received the 2008 Helmholtz Award and the 2019 Ada Lovelace Service Award from the International Neural Network Society. In 2014, he was named a University Distinguished Scholar . He was an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer (2010-2012), and is an IEEE Fellow. He is Co-Editor-In-Chief of Neural Networks , which is a premier journal published by Elsevier. In addition, he serves on the advisory board of Cognitive Computation . He also served as President of the International Neural Network Society in 2006, and currently serves on its governing board. Expertise DeLiang Wang's general area of interest is machine perception. More specifically, he is interested in neural computation for auditory and visual information processing. To achieve this, his research program seeks to uncover computational principles for auditory and visual analysis, including segmentation, recognition and generation. This research is on the basis of psychological/neurobiological data from human and animal perception and computational considerations. A fundamental aspect of perception is its ability to group elements of a perceived scene or sensory field into coherent clusters (objects), generally known as scene analysis and segmentation. The general problem of scene analysis remains unsolved in computational audition and vision. For a number of years, Wang's group focuses on understanding the dynamics of large networks of coupled neural oscillators and their applications to scene analysis (see Wang, 2005 , for a view/review on this research effort). The results of this study have yielded a neurobiologically plausible approach to address the problem of scene analysis. His recent work focuses on developing learning algorithms, in particular deep neural networks, for auditory scene analysis. In order to achieve the ultimate goal of constructing a computational system that possesses the human ability of cocktail-party processing, one must understand individual analyses, such as pitch, location, amplitude and frequency modulation, onset/offset, rhythm, and so on. One must also incorporate top-down mechanisms, such as recognition and attention. His Perception and Neurodynamics Lab (PNL) investigates a variety of topics under the general theme of computational audition where deep learning plays a major role.",

Her research focuses on broadening participation in computing by exploring: 1) race, gender, and identity in the academy and industry; and 2) discipline-based education research to inform pedagogical practices that garner interest and retain women and marginalized populations in computer-related engineering fields. \u00a0She earned a doctoral degree in Engineering Education from Purdue University, M.S. in Computer Science and Software Engineering from Auburn University, and B.S. in Computer Engineering from Elizabethtown College. Before joining OSU she was a tenured professor in the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University. Expertise Race, gender, and computing as it relates to broadening participation in computing. Over the last seven years, our work has been centered on the need to raise the profile of computer science education research in computer science and engineering education with the objective of Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC). The results of our work have put a spotlight on the dearth of literature on minoritized populations (e.g., women, Black and Hispanic) in computing and offer insights that can shape computer science locally and nationally. The need to expand who engages in computing is motivated by the necessity to meet national imperatives of occupational demand, foster innovation, build a workforce that better represents U.S. demographics, and fundamentally move towards the objective of social justice. As such, our work can be described as embodying three pillars under Broadening Participation in Computing \u20131) pathways and experiences, 2) teaching and learning and 3) outreach. Leveraging content knowledge in both computer science and education research, we have developed rigorous research proposals that have yielded over $7M in grant funding. This funding has resulted in 16 peer-reviewed journal publications, 46 peer reviewed conference proceedings, numerous invited talks across the nation including two National Academy of Science, Medicine, and Engineering (NASEM) panels and invited talk at the (NASEM) Frontiers in Engineering. Our portfolio of work leverages mixed-methods to answer complex questions and is guided by theoretical frameworks drawn from the social sciences. We aspire to move our work from the theoretical to the practical to instigate change in the culture of computing.",

Photo: Getty Images Mobile devices that use Bluetooth are vulnerable to a glitch that could allow attackers to track a user\u2019s location, a new study has found. The research revolves around Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a type of Bluetooth that uses less energy\u00a0when compared to Bluetooth Classic (an earlier generation of Bluetooth).\u00a0On smartwatches and smartphones, billions of people rely on this type of wireless communication for all types of activities, ranging from entertainment and sports to retail and health care. Yet due to a design flaw in Bluetooth\u2019s protocol, users\u2019 privacy could be at risk, said Yue Zhang , lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in computer science and engineering at The Ohio State University . Zhang recently presented the findings at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security ( ACM CCS 2022 ).\u00a0The study also received a \u201cbest paper\u201d honorable mention at the conference. Zhiqiang Lin\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Zhang and his adviser, Zhiqiang Lin, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State,\u00a0proved the threat by testing over 50 market-available Bluetooth devices as well as four BLE development boards. They reported the flaw to major stakeholders in the Bluetooth industry, including Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) (the organization that oversees the development of Bluetooth standards), hardware vendors such as Texas Instruments and Nordic, and operating systems providers such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. Google rated their findings as a high-severity design flaw and gave the researchers a bug bounty award. But the good news is that Zhang and Lin also developed a potential solution to the problem that they successfully tested. Bluetooth devices have what are called MAC addresses\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a string of random numbers that uniquely identify them on a network. About once every 20 milliseconds an idle BLE device sends out a signal advertising its MAC address to other nearby devices that it could connect with. The study identifies a flaw that could allow attackers to observe how these devices interact with the network, and then either passively or actively collect and analyze the data to break a user\u2019s privacy. \u201cThis is a new finding that nobody has ever noticed before,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cWe show that by broadcasting a MAC address to the device\u2019s location, an attacker may not physically be able to see you, but they would know that you\u2019re in the area.\u201d One of the reasons researchers are concerned about such a scenario is because a captured MAC address could be deployed in what is called a replay attack, which may allow the attacker to monitor the user\u2019s behaviors, track where the user has been in the past or even figure out the real-time location of the user. \u201cBluetooth SIG was certainly made aware of the MAC address tracking threat, and to protect devices from being tracked by bad actors, a solution called MAC address randomization has been used since 2010,\u201d said Lin. Later in 2014,\u00a0Bluetooth introduced a new feature called the \u201callowlist\u201d which only allows approved devices to be connected, and prevents private devices from accessing unknown ones. But according to the study, this allowlist feature actually introduces a side channel for device tracking. Zhang and Lin proved the new tracking threat is real by creating a novel attack strategy they called Bluetooth Address Tracking (BAT). The researchers used a customized smartphone to hack into more than 50 Bluetooth gadgets \u2013 most of them their own devices \u2013 and showed that by using BAT attacks, an attacker could still link and replay a victim\u2019s data, even with frequent MAC randomization. As of yet, BAT attacks are undefeated, but the team did create a prototype of a defensive countermeasure. Called Securing Address for BLE (SABLE), their solution involves adding an unpredictable sequence number, essentially a timestamp, to the randomized address to ensure that each MAC address can only be used once to prevent the replay attack. The study noted it was successfully able to stop attackers from linking up to the victim\u2019s devices. The results of their experiment showed that SABLE only slightly affects battery consumption and overall device performance, but Lin hopes to use the new attack and its countermeasure to raise awareness in the community. \u201cThe lesson learned from this study is that when you add new features to existing designs, you should revisit previous assumptions to check whether they still hold.\u201d This work was supported by the National Science Foundation.
